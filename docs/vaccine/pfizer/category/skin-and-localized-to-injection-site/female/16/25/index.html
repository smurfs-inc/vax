                                                Right arm immediately went numb down its length and immediately noticeably swelled up, from wrist to shoulder. It was hot to the touch. The arm also developed a rash. Patient was monitored by paramedics, who confirmed her pule, oxygen levels and blood pressure were normal. Conditions improved after about a half hour, but did not resolve completely. Arm is still slightly swollen (after providing Benadryl) and is very painful around injection site, 24 hours later..

                                                The teen had a history of autoimmune disorder, alopecia areata for the past 2 years. When received the first dose of pfizer COVID vaccine, she started losing hair rapidly after about 6 to 7 days.  She was started on large dose of prednisone 100mg per day after 2 weeks to slow down alopecia. However, in the span of 4 days she lost most of her hair.  We are wondering if the vaccine could have exacerbated the autoimmune disorder.

Approximately a minute after vaccine was given, she was noted to be seated upright in the passenger seat of her car, with head bent forward and eyes open. She was unresponsive, stiff posture, and was placed into a reclined position. She then had some posturing with head turned to the left, no eye deviation or nystagmus, no tonic-clonic movement. Radial pulse was thready, bradycardia was noted, with normal respirations. She was noted to become diaphoretic and pale/ashen color noted to the face and arms. She became responsive within a few minutes, however initially was not able to answer questions clearly. She had no loss of bowel or bladder function. EMS assisted with evaluation.  Initial blood pressure 78/31, HR 54, SpO2 100%.  EMS then transferred her to the stretcher and she was transitioned from her car to the ambulance. She continued to improve spontaneously with BP 94/61 then 103/60 and HR 86 then 74. SpO2 remained stable at 100%.  Skin color improved. She had normal responses to questions, no complaints of headache, dizziness, chest tightness, shortness of breath, numbness or tingling. She had some shaking/voluntary movement of the limbs and body noted, but she could control and stop this voluntarily, no myoclonic or tonic-clonic jerking noted.

                                                Pt. received her second Pfizer dose at 3pm. By 11:30pm she had significant swelling on both of her eyes, mouth, and the start of red splotchy skin on arms and legs. We took her to ER. They gave her 50mg of hydroxizine and sent us home. 5min after leaving the ER at 12:30am on 4/23 she felt a golf ball sized lump in her throat and was having difficulty breathing. We brought her back to the ER.  At this time they gave her an ekg, and at around 1:30am gave her an epi pin and an oral steroid. Within 5min of the oral steroid and epi pin she no longer had difficulty in breathing and the lump in her throat was gone as was the res splotches. By 5am the swelling in her face had reduced drastically to 90% normal in her left eye and 70% normal in her right eye and 70% normal in her lip. She was released from the ER at 5:45am and went home to sleep. At 11:30am on 4/23 her swelling in her face remains the same and she is complaining of a headache. She was given 50mg more of hydroxizine.

                                                My daughter was given her 2nd COVID shot at approximately 9:00am on 4-16-2021. We waited 30 minutes after the shot. No issues. That evening at approximately 6:00pm, she had a red rash on her upper chest and throat. She stated that she was having a hard time breathing and swallowing. I gave her  a Benadryl tablet and watched her for approximately 15-20 minutes. she continued to feel tightness in her throat and said it burned when she swallowed. She confirmed again that she felt her throat was swelling. I drove her to the closest ER located at. My daughter was seen and it was determined that she was having an allergic reaction. DR recommended continue Benadryl tab every 4 hours for the next 12-24- hours. We were discharged to home. I administered another does of Benadryl at approximately 10:15pm. My daughter went to sleep. I woke her up at 3:00am to check on her and she stated she did not have a rash and her throat was fine. She was running a low grade fever of 100.5. I gave her 500 mg of Tylenol for the fever. When my daughter woke later that morning at approximately 8:30am, she still did not have a rash or throat swelling. Her fever was gone.

The skin that is affected is swollen.  Benadryl taken orally did not help decrease the rash, nor did topical Benadryl. She also complains of pain to her left leg from her hip to her knee that intermittently bothers her starting 4/30 and still continues to bother her.   The day after the vaccine was given she had injection site pain, tiredness, extreme headache, fever of 101.8, nausea, chills, body aches.  No swelling or redness to injection site.  No lymph node swelling.

Medic noted that the client was CAOx4,  her skin was pale, warm and slightly moist, pupils were equal, round, reactive to light and accommodating (PEARRL), respiration rate (RR) was 20. The client&#39;s sister stated the client had a history of anxiety and that &#34;she gets this way whenever she gets a shot&#34;. Medic walked patient to the zero gravity chair. The client was given water to sip on. At 1213 baseline vitals were taken with client sitting: Blood pressure (BP): 110/82, heartrate (HR): 98, RR: 20, PEARRL. Medic  reports she coached the client on her breathing  to help alleviate her complaint of feeling lightheaded, mild nausea and anxiety. Client reported she felt anxious prior to her vaccination and that her last oral intake was 15 minutes prior to vaccine. Client denied headache, blurry vision and chest pain. At 1220 a second set of vitals were taken while standing: BP 108/80, HR 86, RR 16, CAOx4. Client stated her symptoms were diminishing. Client&#39;s RR slowed down to normal rate and rhythm, vital signs were trending to normal and client was negative for orthostatic pressures. Client was advised to stay for additional 30 minute observation. Client&#39;s symptoms resolved completely and she was able to ambulate away from observation site without assistance and with a steady gait.

                                                12 hours post vaccine she had severe myalgia, rash on both arms and legs, headache, nausea, stomach pain, and mild swelling in legs. Over the next 48 hours the rash darkened and spread to the entire body causing pain in her skin. The myalgia became nearly unbearable and both Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen didn&#39;t put a dent in the pain. One side of her face swelled so that one eye could only partially open. The nausea and stomach pain worsened so that she couldn&#39;t eat. Headache became intense. By 48 hours post vaccine she became delirious - her speech was slurred and difficult to comprehend. She would fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up unaware of where she was or what was happening. She never got a fever but did have chills. Around this time I called a relative who is a doctor to seek advice and Diphenhydramine was recommended. Benedryl helped immensely. 30 minutes after taking it she could speak clearly, was more alert, pain became tolerable, and her appetite returned. Symptoms and swelling returned when the Benedryl wore off so she continued taking it every 4 hours for the next two days until it wasn&#39;t necessary any more. The myalgia, stomach pain and headache persisted for 7 days. At 8 days post vaccine (today) a mild headache, mild and intermittent stomach pain, and mild fatigue are her only remaining symptoms. Her pediatrician cannot see her until next week but we have an appt for the 22nd.

A 16-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, SINGLE dose (at the age of 16 years old) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma from 2018 and ongoing (Has been asthmatic about 3 years and has it under control and hasn&#39;t had issues in years).

The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine.  On 21Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing and face swelling.

The patient has an appointment with an allergist on 05May2021. The pediatrician recommended she wait to get the second dose until after the mother talked to the allergist. She is scheduled for the second dose 30Apr2021. The consumer stated the daughter will miss her second dose tomorrow. The pediatrician told her to wait until speaking to the allergist. If the allergist clears her, it wont be until 05May2021. How long would it be until she can get the second dose. She is not sure if it is related or not. It was 2 weeks after. She ate some kind of granola bar that may have been the cause. Before she called 911 and they gave her epinephrine, it lasted anywhere between maybe up to 15 or 20 minutes. She went to the emergency room (ER) and had to be observed 4 to 5 hours and then went home. Treatment for the events included Epinephrine, steroids and she believes a dose of Pepcid.

My joints were hurting, I had somewhat severe nausea, my head started throbbing. At about 6:40 AM my migraine started, my arm felt hot to the touch, and I got dizzy so I took some acetaminophen.

The next day (today) I have another migraine, my throat and left armpit are still sore,  and my muscles hurt. I?m getting better though.

                                                hives all over her body; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mom). A 16-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety and high functioning autism from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (FLUOXETIN) and hydroxyzine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced hives all over her body on 22May2021. They look like mosquito bites, but are not, and are on her toes, hands, torso, legs, everywhere. They are little red bumps and itchy. Like dime-sized. Some are dime and some are nickel sized. Hives started about 4, maybe 6 hours after the vaccination. Outcome of the event was not recovered, reported as worsened. Therapeutic measures were taken. She was giving Hydroxyzine and putting on a topical ointment, as Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine, stronger than Benadryl. Event did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office.  Information on lot/batch has been requested.

                                                Extreme Hive Break Out for three days.  Extreme Lip Swelling.  I have plenty of pictures if you want them.  We went to Emergency room on Friday and they gave her an IV with Antihistamine and Steroids and Pepcid.  She got better and we went home.  She broke out again all over her body on Saturday and this time we went to Emergnecy room.  They observed her and basically told us when they discharged us to keep her on Benadryl every four hours for the next 48 hours.    I think it&#39;s important to note that she did test positive for COVID 19 on December 11, 2020 and had a fairly mild case of the virus.  ALso, that she has never had this reaction to anything ever before.

                                                Approximately 3 minutes after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccination in her left deltoid developed a flat, non-priuritic, erythemic rash along both anterior arms. She denied any airway involvement; on examination her mouth was without edema or erythema. She was breathing comfortably and in no acute distress. She was provided with 50 mg of diphenhydramine at 11:28. She was rechecked 15 minutes and 30 minutes later, during which time her rash faded but did not resolve.  She was advised that the CDC&#39;s recommendations when an immediate reaction occurs is to not get her second dose, but that she can consider seeing an immunologist/allergist to discuss this more in depth. We discussed that should symptoms worsen, particularly if she develops airway symptoms, she should present to the ER for evaluation. She left the clinic at 12:04 pm accompanied by family in no apparent distress with no further concerns.

                                                On the right forearm, just distal from the elbow on the  prone side there is a purple-brown discoloration that is approx 4 cm by 15 cm.   The area does not blanch when touched and is not swollen or painful.     This is not a typical bruising or discoloration pattern for her.       At the right deltoid injection site there is a 3 cm round induration which is slightly red, warm and painful to touch.   There is swelling around the red spot which is approx 8 cm in diameter.     We are treating the injection site with Tylenol and cold compress.    The discoloration on the lower arm we are watching.    We will pre medicate with Benadryl and Tylenol prior to next dose.

                                                Pt had itching about 50 minutes after getting the Pfizer covid vaccine. Pt waited the time requested and was thankfully still shopping with her mother and brother in the store when the reaction developed. Pt was given 50mg of liquid diphenhydramine. I discussed calling 911 with the family and they said they would prefer we did not if possible. She has food allergies, which were discussed before giving the vaccine and she is used to having reactions, she also knows what anaphylaxis feels like and could tell that was not the reaction she was having. After discussing with the family and consulting with my market direction I decided to not call 911 immediately but let them know that if the diphenhydramine was not helping quickly I would make the call. I observed the patient for 30&#43; minutes with an EpiPen on my person in case she showed any signs of worsening. She improved visibly while getting drowsy from the antihistamine. After she had stabilized for some time and the patient and her family was also comfortable with her improvement I allowed her to depart the pharmacy with a request to keep her EpiPen close and call 911 if things worsen or the EpiPen became necessary.

Medical staff checked throat, blood pressure, O2, laid her down on cot with feet elevated.

While waiting at Urgent Care  for 30 minutes, her face, tongue, and throat became swollen, hives developed on face, and had increased difficulty in swallowing and felt short of breath.  She was taken to a patient room, IV started and Epi-shot was given.  Additional allergy meds were given (Benadryl and Solu-Medro).  She the. Slept for the next 90 minutes.  Swelling decreased and throat felt better.  Monitoring for a couple hours and sent home.

The pressure was drastic, but it slightly relieved after about two minutes. I took 2 benadryl and kept feeling pressure, although it was lessened. After about 2 more hours I took 6 medrol pack 4mg tablets to see if the symptoms alleviated. Around 30 minutes after I took the medrol pack, I felt the same pressure, but on the left side of my neck, and it lessened  after 1 minute.  I still feel some pressure on the left side of my neck 10 hours after the vaccine was administered. I all took 1,000 mg of Acetaminophen 1 hour after the vaccine was administered to relieve some pain that I was feeling in the vaccination site.

He is warm and well-perfused although is slightly tachycardic but appears anxious.  His reported inability to move her arms and legs does not seem consistent with a neurologic etiology of this complaint and more likely consistent with anxiety/conversion reaction in the setting of a vasovagal episode.  Will give zyrtec at mother and patient&#39;s request, PO challenge and reassess.

                                                The rash first started on her hands on 4/2 and was originally attributed to powdered gloves she used during her job at a restaurant. She had her wisdom teeth out on 3/24 and started amoxicillin and steroids for the wisdom teeth on 3/25. She had her first COVID vaccine on 3/30 with arm pain only on 3/31.  She was seen in the urgent care on 4/4 . Rash felt to be due to amoxicillin or contact dermatitis (gloves). She stopped amoxicillin. The rash has continued to evolve. Originally maculopapular and only on hands, nby 4/13  there was both a maculopapular rash in addition to urticarial lesions primarily on her lower extremities, but also present on her trunk and in her groin. It is intensely pruritic. It seems to change over time, though the family is not entirely sure about that. Certainly, they describe confluent erythema and swelling over her right ankle the morning  of 4/13 which was not present by the time she saw me that afternoon. She has had ankle arthralgias as well.    as of 4/16, rash is gone other than feet.

                                                Patient not seen in office.  History obtained via phone from father of patient and patient herself.  Very early on 4/19/2021, 8hrs after receiving her 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination, patient began developing nausea, chills, sweating, fever and malaise.  Highest fever was 102.3&#39;, with symptoms treated with Advil 600mg.  Had x1 episode of vomiting that day, none since. The next day 4/20, patient woke up with new-onset lip swelling, progressing to periorbital swelling and swelling of her facial cheeks &amp; rash.  She then began having a cough with some throat tightness with some mild discomfort with breathing in her throat, but no chest tightness or wheezing.  Tongue not swollen per patient.  Benadryl 25mg PO given multiple times and patient used her Albuterol MDI a few times as well, which helped.  She continued to have fevers to 101&#39; throughout the day, treated with Advil again.  At night, patient then developed semi-itchy red &#34;hives&#34; on her legs. Per patient, she didn&#39;t feel she needed to go to ER for her symptoms or throat tightness/breathing issue.  She was still drinking &amp; urinating well  and had been consuming light solids foods. The same day 4/20 in the afternoon, patient was prescribed over the phone Prednisone 60mg PO x1 which she first took after 5pm, with tapering dose over the next 4 days, in addition to increasing Benadryl to 50mg PO and starting Qvar 80 MDI BID, while using Albuterol prn. Via phone call to father this morning 4/21, patient reportedly slept well last night and woke up this morning with significantly less symptoms.  No longer having throat tightness/breathing issues, with much less periorbital/facial swelling.  Still fatigued but no longer having fevers, either.

                                                After a few minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported dizziness, light headedness, and blurry/dots in vision. She then became more upset leading to hyperventilation and crying. She then said she had tingling in her fingers, which progressed to difficulty moving her fingers/stiff fingers, and coldness and redness in tips of fingers. She then reported she was loosing sensations in her feet and legs. 911 was called. We tried to have the patient take slow deep breaths. We offered an ice pack and water up front and a heat pack for her fingers. Paramedics arrived. Her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, glucose were within normal limits. She was given oxygen and the paramedic was able to help her slow her breathing. Her fingers went back to normal and she felt fine before leaving. She did not feel the need to go with the paramedics.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the shot, my daughter felt hotness running down the length of her vaccinated arm and into her hand. Started feeling hot and started to produce a small patch of hives on the outside of the throat and chest. Did vigorous windmill motions with vaccinated arm.  She had a feeling of slight unwellness that was followed by a rush of energy.  As we leave the store and start to drive home her hives are a little bit worse and she says she feels a little lightheaded and has some heart palpations. But is still reporting a rush of energy. By the time we get home 10 minutes later hives,  lightheadedness, and heart palpations have resolved.  She feels great the rest of the day. Next day slight redness around the injection site and arm a bit sore. The following day redness is gone but a slight rash is starting to show up around the neck. 5 days later, the rash becomes inflamed, sore, hot and itchy, hives are full upper-body flareups. She takes Allegra 24 for hives control. Rash comes and goes daily.  Acts more like hives. Allegra 24 controls hives mostly along with icing. After a few days, the effectiveness of the Allegra 24 is not as efficient with the neck rash. Switches to Zyrtec 24 which seems to provide better relief from both hives and rash around the neck. Sees Dr. April 29th. He advises not to take a second dose of Pfizer at this time and prescribes her an EpiPen.

As I was waiting for the next patients to arrive, another technician notified me that she had a reaction of vomiting.  When asked patient stated after the injection she felt burning from the site to the nape of her neck and while waiting at the observation area she had nausea and went to one of our stations to vomit in the trash.  Patient was escorted to our treatment room  for vitals and was given a cold pack for the back of her neck.  Our Allergist provider was called to assess patient.  When I had arrived to the treatment room to observe her, patient stated this was the first time she had this type of reaction.  The provider ordered for her to stay and be observed for 1 hour with 15 minute intervals of vitals.  The patient had no other reactions and had no pain, vitals were within normal limits.

                                                Eleven days later, she got another allergic reaction with blister on her arm, water filled blister; She got blister on the opposite arm of the injection, on her right arm; Diagnosed her with a skin disease that happens when your immune system is under attack; Her arm is now swollen around the blister; bullous pemphigoid; cellulitis; Had an allergic reaction; Itchiness; They gave her a high dose/received a higher dose of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 17-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Apr2021 at 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ew0153) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma seasonal only during allergy season. No episodes this year. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  Concomitant medications included Multivitamin/women&#39;s one a day gummies. The parent reported that her daughter had the vaccine done on 10Apr2021 and she had an allergic reaction that evening, she had itchiness. So, I contacted the pharmacist that she had an allergic reaction and she told me that they gave her a high dose and there were few patients who got the high dose. So, eleven days later, she got another allergic reaction with blister on her arm, water filled blister, I took her to an urgent care and they referred me to a dermatologist that diagnosed her with a skin disease that happens when your immune system is under attack (event captured as per verbatim). So, I went to her primary doctor and her primary doctor has put her on antibiotic because her arm is now swollen around the blister, so now, she is on ointment, antibiotic and vitamin d (treatment) to bring up her immune system and also she has to get her blood work done to check her immune system. She also stated that the reaction my daughter is now having and how her primary doctor is suggesting not to take her second dose because she highly thinks it is an allergic reaction to the vaccine.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.         Reported Event: Four hours after the injection on 10Apr2021 (Name) entire body began to itch and the top of mouth. The pharmacist was notified and at the time and further explained that (Name) was one of the patients that day who received a higher dose of the vaccine at the time of injection. The pharmacist did not notify me of how high the dosage was. So I cannot put the exact details on this report because I was not given that information by the pharmacist. I suggest the pharmacist be contacted for the exact mistaken dosage. The second side effect was on 21Apr2021 (Name) woke up with a water filled blister on her right arm which ruptured with a yellow liquid. We seeked medical attention on 21Apr2021 and 23Apr2021 from 3 different facilities. The outcome was (Name) being diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid and cellulitis. (Name) was placed on cephalexin 500mg, vitamin d 50mcg/2000 units, mupirocin 2%, and fluconazole 150 mg to build her immune system back up.

A 17-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: Unknown, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced she&#39;s been itchy every-since, roughness coming up and rash coming up. Caller states, her daughter got the first Pfizer vaccine on 08Apr2021, she has been itchy every-since, this started 2 days later. Caller spoke to her doctor and he said it&#39;s probably a reaction to vaccine. Her daughter has no rash, just itchy skin, the only difference today was it looks like or has roughness or rash coming up. Dermatologist says it&#39;s probably from her scratching, and says it makes sense that it&#39;s probably the vaccine. The way it looks, he didn&#39;t feel it would be a problem to get the second dose, since it occurred 2 days later. Caller asked, was it recommend to get the second dose. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained

                                                Patient became light headed and fainted from a seated position about 10 minutes after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination. She doesn&#39;t think she lost consciousness. Her skin was quite warm and sweaty after this event. I had her remain laying down on the ground while she recovered and I assessed her symptoms. She felt better almost immediately so I had her move to the pharmacy office for observation for an additional 15-20 minutes. She then reported that she has fainted with shots before and she hadn&#39;t eaten anything today. Her mother said this has happened before and drove her home once she felt well again.

                                                Less than 1 minute after received the shot, patient became clammy and pale while sitting in chair. Her eyes rolled back in her head and her body went slack. Myself (parent) and the nurse who had given the shot braced her on either side while she appeared to fade in and out of consciousness for several minutes (she seemed to occasionally interact with us, mumbling responses to &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; questions). The nurse did not want to lower her to the floor, but wanted to keep her propped on the chair. Her head kept rolling to the side. At one point, she began to jerk rhythmically.  Just as I was about to bring this to the attention of the nurse, the patient returned to consciousness. Patient was moved to a rolling recliner chair and taken to a recovery area where I (parent) did not see her for another 30 minutes as I was receiving my own shot. The chair she had sat in was wet, but it was assumed this was due to sweat (patient had sweated profusely).  On the way out of the clinic, noticing a wet stain on the back side of patient&#39;s pants, I asked if she had wet her pants (quietly) two separate times. Patient denied it both times. However, upon returning home, patient confirmed that she had wet her pants.  Patient was monitored during the evening for similar adverse events ; none noted.  Patient ate lunch approximately 1 hour before receiving shot and was given crackers while at clinic. Patient is a well-hydrated individual, and also drank water while on-site. No fever either before or after shot. A slightly elevated BP the next day (135/83). However, patient complained of headache, fatigue, and pain at injection location; elevated BP may be related to headache and/or ordeal from day of the shot.

A 17-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 20May2021 (age at the time of vaccination 17-year-old) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergic to sulfa drugs. Historical vaccine includes first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that after receiving the shot patient experienced after receiving the shot she experienced the &#34;covids bullseye&#34;, a circle on her arm at the site of administration, tired, her arm was a little sore. On Saturday, the patient got a rash of the diameter of a lemon on her inner thigh, so the reporter told her to only use sunblock, next day (Sunday) both legs were covered in a rash. Reporter looked on the Pfizer&#39;s website and saw that rash was reported in 0.001 percent of people who had the vaccine. Also, on Sunday, reporter took the patient to the doctor but he was not there, so she called a service (reporter did not elaborate on this) and a person told them that the rash could be from a serious disease called &#34;petechiae rash&#34; and told them to take patient to ER where she got the shot. Once in the ER, they told them that it was not the serious condition &#34;petechiae rash&#34; but that it was a &#34;rash&#34; and that they had never heard before of anybody experiencing a &#34;rash&#34; after the administration of the vaccine. Reporter wanted to know if &#34;rash&#34; has been reported as an adverse event of the Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine, how long after the administration of the vaccine appears and how long it lasts. She would also like to know if we can call the facility to let them know that &#34;rash&#34; was reported as a side effect of the vaccine, since she was upset because she does not understand how someone in the ER does not know that &#34;rash&#34; was an adverse reaction and they had them thinking for a couple of hours that patient could be suffering of a serious disease. Reporter does not want someone else to go through this situation. Reporter mentioned that in the ER told them to wait 2 days and give Benadryl to patient, so she wanted to confirm if this was the right treatment for patient and if she should wait those 2 days to see if the rash was gone before she calls the doctor. Reporter wanted to know how long after the administration of the vaccine the rash appears and how long the rash would last. The outcome of the event was unknown   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Arm hurt; Tired; Rash all over both of her legs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s grandparent). A 17-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20May2021 16:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), at the age of 17-years-old as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergic reaction of Sulphur drugs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had her second Pfizer shot on Thursday 20May2021 at 4:30, the only side effect she seem to have, was her arm hurt and she was tired and the reporter don&#39;t know, her aunt was a pharmacist and said that circle that she developed at the site of the shot, and called it as a Covid bullseye. On Saturday 22May2021, the patient had rash about the size of a diameter of  a lemon on the inside of her leg, the reporter didn&#39;t think anything out she has been out in the sun so they just observed until Sunday, 23May2021 she got the rash all over both of her leg. Previously she was has an allergic reaction of Sulphur drugs so with this rash all over both of her legs what they did was they called her doctors office Sunday and they haven&#39;t answering. They have a service that you can call about medical things, person that answers, there was a woman and said she know nothing about a rash they thought it would may be side effect from Pfizer because the reporter looked on the website and in the website rash was listed, usually rare. The patient does not have anaphylactic shock any of that there was a rash they think it was 0.001 they tried to explain this to the woman and she insisted it was something called Petechiae rash, which is a serious rash. She insisted not take the patient to the urgent care, she said they should take her to the ER and not urgent care, they took her to the ER they said they didn&#39;t know, it was definitely not the Petechiae rash which was a released that&#39;s a serious problem. They said it was okay to just give her Benadryl which they could have decided to give at home, but they didn&#39;t know if Benadryl was okay to take if the patient took the COVID vaccine. They were advised to bring her back to the doctor in 2 days if it doesn&#39;t go away. ER said they had never seen anyone who had a rash, they don&#39;t know any rash. The reporter tried to tell  that it&#39;s on the website it&#39;s on a Pfizer website and thought she was thinking she should alert them about this because this was a lot of lot of gut ranching and anxiety that if this person calling from the doctor saying that the rash was a Petechiae rash which was a serious blood disease. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I visited a physician at a medical clinic on June 8 and the doctor prescribed me some medications that would reduce the allergic reactions and itchiness. As of right now, June 9 I did notice that some of the rashes on my face is starting to fade but the red bumps on my arm have not gotten better.

An 18-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EL1283, expiration date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a school or student health clinic. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. She did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. The patient was just nervous for a good amount of the time. When she got the vaccine she was overthinking and her left hand began to throb. She was not in pain but just a sinking feeling. She stated that she was not good with needles, so it was certainly good that it went quicker and less painful than she expected. She added that her nurse treated her so well and was so patient with her and she appreciated it so much. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19: Nasal Swab with result of negative on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event. Outcome of the event was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Eight days after her injection, Raised bump  that looked like two mosquito bites about the size of two nickels  pushed next to each other; brief 99-101 F fever that lasted only an hour or two for two consecutive nights. Bump turned flat and area got to be more of a red spot in similar size. Resolved itself in 24 hours after redness.  Not serious but worth mentioning because I have read about this fairly uncommon side effect from recent NEJM article, but ghe article stated the effects were coming from folks who had the Moderna shot, and not the Pfizer.

Hives and flushing resolved within 30 minutes. Approx 45 minutes post reaction symptoms, patient reports feeling better, flushing resolved. Denied wanted further workup or transfer to ER and left with her mother.

She also experienced shooting pains and tingling in the same arm she received the vaccination. At work, it hurts when she carries things and has dropped items, which is unusual. Pain is mainly in the shoulder, but sometimes in the forearm. She has tried Tylenol, ice and naproxen with no relief. She received methylprednisolone on 4/12, and now feels that she is having an allergic reaction.  Complaints of increased wheezing, shortness of breath and swelling of her skin, she has used her albuterol inhaler at home which has provided no relief.   On 4/13 she received albuterol by nebulizer and an IV dose of methylprednisolone at the emergency department. She is going to start albuterol nebulizer at home, continue OTC antihistamine, discontinue the methyprednisolone and start prednisone tomorrow.

                                                12 hours after receiving the second dose of Pfizer I felt fatigued and my injection site was red and swollen. 24 hours after the vaccine I was experiencing abdominal cramping, headache, and fatigue. 48 hours after I developed a severe full-body rash/hives/welts. It started as a small patch on my left arm and progressed to my hips, legs, arms, chest, back, and face - my whole body. The rash is extremely itchy and has caused me to bust blood vessels from scratching so hard and frequently. I began rotating Benadryl and Zyrtec, but it seemed to make it worse. I visited the ER in the middle of the night on 4/18 where I was given steroids and Benadryl IM along with Pepcid. The rash went away a few hours after, but has since then reappeared and I am currently running a low grade fever of 100.2. I am taking Prednisone 20mg 3x a day as prescribed by my doctor along with Benadryl 50mg every four hours and Pepcid twice a day. Despite these medications the rash continues to persist.

However I received my vaccine and two mornings after I developed 30&#43; small red dots scattered over my torso and neck. They do not resemble bites nor do they itch. They calmed in size and redness over 24 hours however the marks are still there.  I have no known allergies or sensitivities and my friend had similar spots developed on his arms and upper torso the second morning after receiving the vaccine as well.

                                                bleeding; less soreness at the injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 18-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration administrated on left arm on 05Apr2021 at 16:00 at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other medications in two weeks. The patient did not have any known allergies. She received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, Lot number: EN6204, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administrated on left arm on 14Mar2021 at 15:00 (03:00 PM) at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 05Apr2021 04:00 PM, reported that the 2nd dose of vaccine caused unusual amount of bleeding after needle was removed. The patient had to clean excess blood after the shot. The band aid was soaked with blood. The patient experienced less soreness at the injection site compared to the first vaccine shot. The concern is whether the vaccine was bled out due improper injection. She did not have any other vaccine in four weeks before the covid-19 vaccine dose. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. She was not having COVID prior to the vaccination, neither was tested for Covid-19 post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in 2021.

She was having red bumps on her arm and small patches on her leg. Mom said she did not have any type of reaction when she received her first Pfizer vaccine. I recommended patient to take benadryl and monitor for any additional signs of anaphylaxis. If rash spreads or other signs such as trouble breath, swelling of face, etc happen she should go to emergency room. I will be filling out the VAERS form as soon as I submit this event.

The leg symptom were present when seen 5 days ago, though were not discussed as Patient wasnt sure if thats what was really starting.

EKG was notable for Sinus tach and nonspecific T wave abnormalities.  Discharged home with close follow up. Since then the intensity of the symptom as worsened and the leg symptoms have gotten more pronounced and consistent with the upper extremities symptom.

She was assigned a 30 minute wait time. She received her vaccine at 1225 on 14May2021, and approximately 15 minutes later developed itchiness around her mouth and face. She reported this felt similar to the beginning of her prior episode. Physician and nurse were notified, who evaluated patient. Patient?s airway was clear, respirations unlabored and normal to auscultation. Vitals were within normal limits. EMS was notified, and 50mg Benadryl was given at 1255. At this time patient?s reaction appeared minor and stable, so epipen was at patient?s side however not given yet. EMS arrived rapidly, and repeated eval, confirming same evaluation and history. Patient was transferred in stable condition to the ER for extended monitoring.

The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced rash on 27Apr2021, itching on 28Apr2021, tongue is numb and tingling on 27Apr2021, allergic reaction on 27Apr2021, she thought it was acne at first, but at the injection site she broke out on 27Apr2021, rashes on both arms/saw other red dots appear on 27Apr2021. Clarified allergic reaction as: She thought it was acne at first, but at the injection site she broke out. She has rashes on both arms. Rash seems to be spreading. Really started to show on day two and day three. Hasn&#39;t taken anything for it. She tends to break out on her arms, that&#39;s just her own body, but she saw other red dots appear that hadn&#39;t been there on her arms. She was itching last night and that was new. Is not itching as of now. She went to the hospital and was told to take Benadryl. Clarified she went to the vaccination facility, which was the hospital, and she was asked what was going on. She was not a patient of the ER and was not admitted to the hospital. Forgot to mention her tongue has been numb and tingling for a couple of days. First noticed it when she had something cold, but has persisted even without drinking something cold. Started Tuesday, 27Apr2021, night. Wondering if that is a side effect. Read in the pamphlet it is part of an allergic reaction. Read that rash is a part of a severe reaction.Outcome of all events was not recovered.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events.

                                                Patient given vaccination ID unclear if this was the LOT number. She developed a mild skin rash one day after vaccination, which spread over her face, neck and chest and arms, with lip swelling, but no other oropharyngeal edema. The rash was itchy and pruritic, raised macules that were slightly erythemaic on the face, and sparsely papular on the arms.  We prescribed benadryl and prednisone, with instructions to call our service line and also see us in the office on Monday.  She had unresolved blood tests, hyperglycemia,  which we were trying manage with our staff however she was not adherent to follow up with us due to college coursework.   My associate is her primary care attending, and had requested assistance in filling out the VAERS form.

                                                After receiving my shot on 4/22 I started getting singular hive like bumps on my legs and arms, thinking they were big bites I ignored them until they began to form a sort of rash covering my left hand and sporadically on the left side of my body. When the rash formed I went to urgent care on the morning of 5/2, at the urgent care the doctor prescribed me a steroid to help calm the rash down, at this time I was also taking benadryl to help. The next morning, 5/3, Around 5 in the morning my mother rushed me to the ER where they gave me an IV of benadryl, and steroids, and they also have me a shot of epinephrine. This helped the reaction, but I was referred to a dermatologist to see if they could figure out the cause of the ?rash? they did a biopsy and concluded that there was a hypersensitivity reaction  such as urticaria  and drug eruption.

I?m not entirely sure when it first appeared, but I first noticed it around April 20th, 2021. A couple weeks later, on May 4th, 2021, I noticed small red spots spreading, concentrated in the middle of my chest &amp; branching out. The spots continued to spread &amp; blossom all over my trunk, neck, hairline, arms &amp; upper thighs. It was eventually suggested by a family friend that it was Pityriasis Rosea, which fit all of my symptoms &amp; matched the timeline to a T.

The second dose was reportedly worse. The fever ranged from 104.8 degrees Fahrenheit as a high and 102 degrees Fahrenheit being low, which receded after 3 days of care. In addition, chest pains and heart pain started at 8:00pm the day of the vaccination which was completed at 11:15am. Pain at the injection site and overall body muscle aches lasted for 3 days.   The heart/chest pains have yet to recede. Instead it is occurring more frequently in ?bursts? of pain with a constant aching sensation.

By Friday afternoon, she had tried Benadryl and calamine lotion only to have it continue to get worse. We ended up with the Urgent care by 4pm Friday, 4-30-21. They gave her Prevacid and prescribed steroid cream. They told us if it got worse or affected breathing to go ER. We went home and kept taking the benedryl every 6 Hours and using the steroid cream. as one welt would begin to disappear, others would pop up. the steroid cream did not help in that regard. the benedrul would give about 50% relief for about 2 hours before the itching got very bad. Unable to sleep to do anything, we took patient to the pediatrician that Sat morning 5-1-21. She examined her and told her to take Claritin in the morning and Zyrtec at night to help. She was hestiant to prescribe any steroids due to unknown interaction or affects with the Covid shot. She told us to keep checking in with her and also if it got worse or spread to her face/mouth or any trouble breathing to go to the ER. We went home and tried to take an oatmeal bath. It only made things worse. By 10pm that Sat night 5-1-21, the hives had spread to patient&#39;s face and lips and were affecting her throat. Her voice got very raspy. we decided at that point to take her to the ER. They started her on steroids that night. She continued taking the steroids for 5 days after that. The steroids did help make her hives go away. However, within 2 days of finishing the steroids, patient noticed that she still did not feel 100%. That Saturday 5-8-21, She began to feel light-headed and off. She also began to feel fatigued. She came home from an errand needing to lay down and feeling dizzy. A few days after that, she began to have gas and indigestion, feeling like something caught in her throat and feeling nauseous. She also noticed that there a few nights in all of this that she would wake up shivering for no reason. The shivering would continue until she woke up in the morning. This report is being filed on 5-30-21. Since her 2nd shot and after the hives, we have been dealing with ongoing dizziness, fatigue, tiredness, lightheadedness and nausea to varying degrees. She has not been able to resume regular activates of being active or working out. WE have been back to the dr.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; formulation solution for injection; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date as 2ND DOSE,SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s Disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on 31Mar2021 for covid-19 immunization and experienced severe indigestion, vomiting and did not feel well. On an unspecified date (36 hours after receiving the second dose of vaccine), the patient broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching, her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The patient was prescribed steroid creams, and she self-administered three antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl. The hives went away. After that on an unspecified date, the patient had gastrointestinal (GI) issues, she had very gassy feeling of something stuck in the throat, and had nausea to the point of being unable to eat. Also, she shivered and shakes out of the blue, felt lightheaded and dizzy with extreme fatigue. The patient received treatment with steroid creams, and antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl for the events 36h after &#34;broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching and her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The caller (reporter) mentioned that she heard that the vaccine causes problems in fertility hence caller asked for information on fertility studies with regards to the vaccine in response she was explained reports on the possible side effects, mentioned no information found for non-reported AEs, and referred to health care professional (HCP) for further guidance. Further, caller asked for information on how to treat or go about with the side in response she was informed that Pfizer was unable to make treatment recommendations specific for individual patients and referred to HCP for further guidance. Again, Caller asked, &#34;how the vaccines work&#34; in response she was explained about vaccine mechanism and CDC information. Caller asked if there was a way to measure the spiked proteins in the body as caller wanted to know how to measure/assess immunity after vaccination in response she was being explained about CDC recommendation, and referred to HCP for further guidance. Moreover, caller asked if there were other proteins in the body/organs/cells that were similar to the spike protein that our body could possibly react to in response mentioned that no information found on body components similar to the SARS-CoV2 Spike Protein, and she was referred to HCP for discussion. Caller complained and mentioned &#34;reporter don&#39;t think all this information is being made public, it just seems to me like the issues for the vaccine is much worse for her than as if she got COVID19. Reporter really hope that the Doctors/ CDC / Pfizer and all organizations would reconsider this, especially on the possibility on the issue on the body attacking its own self.&#34; The outcome of the event hives was considered as resolved while the outcome of all other reported events was unknown at the time of this report.  Information on Batch/Lot number has been requested.

The caller thinks it was just the lymph nodes; having pain in her left arm, which is the arm she had her COVID vaccine in, under her armpit towards her breast area; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (parent). An 18-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 24May2021 (at the age of 18-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EW0179) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications.

The nurse was calling about her daughter who experienced some side effects after receiving the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 24May2021. The daughter had the vaccine administered on the left arm. On the same arm around the area lower than the armpit towards the breast she felt pain. The nurse thinks it was just the lymph nodes and nothin to worry about but the daughter wanted to hear that from someone else and not form her. The nurse was asking if this what the daughter was experiencing was normal and was it the lymph nodes. The nurse further reported that her daughter was having pain in her left arm, which was the arm she had her COVID vaccine in, under her armpit towards her breast area and she was wondering if that was normal. The nurse stated that personally she thinks that it was from her daughter&#39;s lymph nodes but since the nurse was the patient&#39;s mom, she would rather hear this from someone else. The events started on 25May2021. The reporter considered the events as serious medically significant. The patient had not yet recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events Breast pain, Lymph node pain and Vaccination site pain are assessed as possibly related to the suspect bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), based on strong temporal association.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 19-year-old female nurse reported for herself that received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number Unknown), on 07Jan2021 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had not any medical history and did not receive any concomitant drugs.  The nurse reported that she had got this shot in her left arm and it is not too swollen but it has been swollen for about 4 days and there is still pain and redness in the site as well. It feels a little hard but it&#39;s just blood in that area. The nurse took a Tylenol (LOT# EK9231) or 2, but it didn&#39;t really do much. At the time of reporting the patient had not recovered.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

One of the nurses at the site, gave me several doses of Benadryl and a Zyrtec. I was there 45 minutes - I kept getting more and more hives and my throat was getting itchy and my breathing was off a little bit. After taking the Benadryl, it started slowing down eventually and I was able to leave in 45 to fifty minutes. My primary care physician told me to take Benadryl before and after getting the second round of the vaccine. I had hives and a small rash on my chest for three days and I had to take Benadryl for those days. I t was extremely itchy. Symptoms resolved by end of day three.  There was also a slight tingling in my fingers  while I was experiencing the rash.

                                                Following the injection, I made my way to the observation room to wait for 10 minutes. After about two, my left arm began to get extremely hot and I called the nurse in the room over. I began to ask her if it was a normal side effect and began to lose my vision and hearing while talking. I passed out and was wheeling to the side of the room where the doctor was. Upon waking up (after 2/3 minutes) I threw up. The doctor took vitals and such and said everything looked okay. After about 15 minutes I was able to stand and head home.

                                                S:  Patient began to develop petechiae within about 10 minutes of her vaccination today.  She felt well, without respiratory distress or urticaria. Later on, she developed some tingling in the right palm and part of her forearm.  Her vaccination was on the left side.  There were no visible changes associated with these symptoms.   O: I personally witnessed the spontaneous appearance of small petechiae on patient&#39;s forearm.  She had about 10 of them on either forearm and a couple on her shoulders.   No erythema, rash, wheals.   BP128/66 P 70 sPO2 100% RR 12     A:  I was unsure regarding the importance of this finding, so I called emergency department and conferred with one of the MDs there.  We felt that, since the patient was in no distress, and this condition was not getting worse, we would allow her to head home.   After a total of an hour of monitoring, no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis or respiratory distress of any sort had emerged.

I decided to leave after sitting for 20 minutes and go back to work because it got a little better. on tuesday.   A few hours later, my chest started to ache and my throat started to hurt. thinking I had asthma due to the heat, i ignored it and used my inhaler.   By the next day, I was coughing and it hurt worse. I was still dizzy but worse, felt neasious and had a headache. I used my inhaler twice with no help. My arm started to hurt to move, and my injection spot became a red lump.   By Thursday, I could barely take a normal breath. It hurt to walk, talk, yawn, sneeze or anything that lifted my need to breathe above bare minimum. It hurt greatly and I couldn&#39;t take a full breath. I felt like my lungs were swollen and my throat hurt to swallow. I was very dizzy and had horrible nausea.

                                                I Received the shot at 10:45am on April the 15th, no side effects except arm soreness afterward. Then at around 7:40pm that same night, I began getting terrible itchy on my face, back, arms, and neck. It worsened and I started having trouble breathing (it felt like my throat had tightened)/a hoarse voice, and my pulse was faster than usual and I felt woozy and tired.. I called a nurse hotline and she recommended for me to be seen at an ER, and I went home to tell my parents and they called a doctor friend, and I was told to take Benadryl and if anything got worse to go to the ER. The next day when I woke up I felt mainly tired and had a slight cough and was scheduled a telehealth appointment, and I am taking Zyrtec 10mg and Pepsin 20mg daily x one week with Benadryl as a back up in case the symptoms flare up, and am advised to go to the ER if the breathing issues return. In terms of symptoms now, I am just a little itchy.

                                                Patient slumped into chair in the observation area. I rushed to her. She was hyperventilating, but not wheezing or making any high pitched sound while breathing. Patient was conscious, and could answer my questions coherently. Patient was told to take off her mask so she can breath more easily. Patient kept saying &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; and was told there&#39;s nothing to feel sorry for, and we wanted to make sure she was fine. Pulse was slightly elevated. Hands were warm and sweaty. Patient asked for a bottle of water. After drinking some water she felt better. It was likely a panic attack episode. I checked on her five minutes later. She just finished talking on the phone with a family or friend. She was a lot better at this point. She agreed that that was likely a panic attack. I advised her she should be able to receive the 2nd dose later, but should consult her PCP.

I put a topical Benadryl on the reaction, however, they have yet to go away, but they have darkened slightly in color and have gotten more itchy as time has passed.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving vaccine daughter felt something was not right as we sat in 15 minute holding period. She was holding her chest. I advised her to sit and I would get help.  as I turned she was standing next to me holding her chest saying she isnt feeling right.  they put her on a bed and was looking for a blood pressure cuff.  they placed a pulseox on her finger which showed 100.  then they placed another clip on her other finger and it showed her heart rate increasing to 138 from 93 in seconds. her face was red her neck was red and she said her heart was racing.   they finally found a BP cuff and her blood pressure was 148/94 which they said this was normal.  it was not. they they told us to seek medical attention.  She continued to complain about chest pain and racing and her face and next continued to be red.  the nurse then gave her 50ml of benadryl with no relief.  She was taking out by wheelchair to a waiting ambulance then to the Hospital Emergency Room.  They treated her with a Steroid and IV.  She was released after about 3 hours.  we came home and 2 hours later went back to the same Emergency room for the same chest pain and racing  at which point  she now had a rash on chest and neck.  this time they gave her medicine to slow down her heart which made her feel better.  she was then released.   Since then she continues to have heart papatations and rashes, and a heard time swallowing with a continue feeling something is stuck in her throat.

                                                I got my first vaccine dose on March 21. On March 27, i started developing a rash in my armpit. when i went to the urgent care, i was given a steroid cream to apply to my armpit. within 4 days of using the steroids the rash had went down significantly. Around April 1, i started feeling a burning, stinging, uncomfortable, sensation near my vagina. Shortly after i went to an urgent care, again. When i went to the urgent care i prescribed two other creams, one being a medicated steroid i was told to put around my vagina. After two weeks of still being uncomfortable, i made an appointment with my gynecologist. My gynecologist took cultures, to find that i had a minor yeast infection, which i took monistat for, and it cleared up within a day. The pain was still persistent so I made a follow up appointment with my gynecologist, and she says everything seems to be normal. I?ve seen 4 different doctors who cannot tell me what is medically wrong with me, but i have never had any problems like this before receiving the vaccine.

                                                About 10 hours after my second dose, I began to have muscle pain. The muscle pain is different than body aches that I?ve gotten with a cold. My muscles hurt and my skin is sensitive to the touch. It feels like the pain goes from the skin to the bone. I don?t know how else to describe it other than  feeling like a bad a sinus infection inside of my muscles. I know that?s a weird way to describe it but the pain is kind of indescribable and unique. The pain is worst in my neck and back. My joints also feel inflamed, it?s hard to close my hands into a fist. I spent most of the night freezing cold and shivering (I live without air conditioning).  It has been  about 35 hours since I received the vaccine. Cold and shivering has subsided but I have have the sweats for the past 8 or so hours. A bit of nausea and stomach pain started about 15 hours after the vaccine.

She walked to the front of the store and and started felling dizzy, therefore, mom had patient sit down on the floor. Our store manager noticed she was on floor and cam over to offer assistance. Pt&#39;s mom said she pass out and was not feeling good. I was paged and upon going to front of the store saw the patient on the floor. I came up to and ask how she&#39;s feeling and noticed she was flushed and warm. An associate got her some water and a chair. Our store manager offered to call 911 and mom did not want an ambulance called and after 15 to 20 minutes of sitting in the chair drinking water, patient was able to leave the store with no assistance. I called to check on Pt at 5:30pm and she was feeling good with no other issues.

                                                My daughter was fine on the first day.  She woke up the next day with a weird headache that her scalp hurt.  She went into work and started to feel poorly throughout the day.  When she came home, she went to bed at 4:30 pm as she had aches &amp; pains, continued headache, felt nauseous, tired, and noticed her left leg where she had surgery previously was bothering her with pins and needles. I told her to go to bed and she would be fine the next day. On 5/26, her leg was giving her increased problems where she could not flex her foot, nerve pain in her leg along with numbness, and she still had the headache. I told her to call her primary care physician and the nurse had her go the the ER.  They ran no tests, but consulted with neuro on call and surgeon who performed surgery on her leg two years ago.  She was instructed to follow-up with a neuro and start PT.  We got her into a PT. The next day she continued to have same issues, but her leg pain increased.  She followed up via phone twice to primary where the nurse told her to go back to the ER. She had blood work, ultra sound and x-ray.  She saw neurologist on  6/2 and is scheduled for follow-up with an EMG on 6/14.  She has seen physical therapist 6x since 5/26 and still has numbness, nerve pain, etc.  The form from neuro office said left foot drop and parathesia. She has had headaches this week including a migraine on 6/8.

Chills Around 30 minutes after, she had also developed: ? Swelling of the tongue (felt &#34;heavy&#34;) ? Flushing, diaphoresis, and nausea, followed later by vomiting ? Dizziness/lightheadedness/weakness ? Dyspnea, wheezing, and cough ? Hives on arms and chest    No throat tightening or tachypnea. She did not attempt speech.  No one in the clinic took her blood pressure or pulse ox   The patient brought her epi pen with her but elected not to use it. Left after 30 minute observation period.  Thinks that the people at the vaccine clinic did not recognize that she had hives because of her dark complexion.  The people administering vaccines were not medically trained    Patient&#39;s mom recognized that she was not feeling well when she picked her up.  She took benadryl which helped with allergy symptoms.  She then developed fever up to 102.3, chills, headache, nausea, and myalgias x 5 days

Injection site soreness began immediately after the vaccine, but is normal for me. Everything else began at time listed on this form (1/25/2021 afternoon) and ended by the following morning. I took one Tylenol to help with the chills and pain about 5 hours after symptoms started and it seemed to help a little.

The person observing her noticed she seemed  zoned out and asked how she was doing at about 2:17 and learned that her tingliness was  turning into numbness of  extremities focused on her upper body.  She started displaying other symptoms of a minor panic attack.  We monitored her for the full 30 minutes, had her walk around, drink water, etc. She claimed that while her numbness wasn&#39;t getting better, it also wasn&#39;t getting worse. It was starting to itch though, so she was given some benedryl.  She then went home for the evening where her roommate could monitor her.   Next day, she called in to confirm that her numbness/itchiness had turned into a rash on her chest which has disappeared. But now is experiencing diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness.  She was informed that these symptoms were within the normal range of immune responses, but that if she was too miserable, she could go in to urgent care for medical assistance. She declined to do so at that time (approximately 11:45 am).

                                                About an hour (5:30pm est) after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on my left arm (taken Saturday, March 6th at around 4:30pm est) I started feeling itchy all over my body (neck, stomach, sides, thighs) and it looked like a rash (very red) showing me signs of an allergic reaction. The same thing happened throughout the day on Sunday (March 7th) and the rash would get better and then worsen so it was very on and off throughout my entire body. On Sunday evening after I took 2 Benadryls the rash got worse on my right arm and a small area of my left arm (bubbly-like features appeared). I went to sleep after taking the Benadryl and when I woke up the next morning it was completely gone. Then on Monday (March 8th) I was fine all day no signs of rashes or itching and then around 5pm I felt a burning sensation on my face and when I looked in the mirror both of my cheeks and a small part of my forehead were extremely red. I then took 2 Benadryls again and went to bed. Today (March 9th) I do not have signs of a rash and have not felt itchy all day.

The &#39;blister&#39; is on my right hand index finger (measured 9 mm by 7 mm at its widest points, has not changed size or character since appearing) with a fainter in color &#39;blister&#39; (5 mm by 3 mm at widest) present on my right hand pinkie. No &#39;trauma&#39; to the site. Nonblanching, two petechiae present within the ring finger&#39;s blister, two also present in the one on my pinky. Those petechiae have disappeared in the last two days, but the spots are still present. Red, not warm, sensitive to touch. I had no other symptoms from dose one of the vaccination, outside of a sore arm and some joint pain. Possibly fatigue, but that&#39;s likely just me being fatigued as per usual.

                                                On 3-15-21 patient received 1st dose Pfizer vaccine on L deltoid, states that 2 days after the jab she developed a pruriginous rash on ventral aspect of L forearm above wrist area. Rash faded away on its own. Denied SOB, wheezing, cough, facial swelling. denied any rashes on other areas of her body. she did not disclose that rash to us at the clinic. On 04/05/21 she came to the clinic for 2nd jab, on screening and immunization documentation she mark no on &#34;like to speak with health care provider&#34; but prior to HS providing 2nd jab she brought to her attention the previous symptoms. I intervene and discuss with the patient and asked the nature of the previous symptoms. Due to a miscommunication and misunderstanding, on my part, I thought that her rash was initially on site of injection and that it spread distally, discuss with her Covid arm for about 10-15 minutes with patient as I thought initially that it was a COVID arm and proceed to allow 2nd jab and order to keep her in observation for 30&#39;. 2nd jab administered on R arm this time. About 3 minutes after jab, she developed  three lesions on forearm, 2 bumps approximately .2 cm diameter, with mild hyperemia on dorsal aspect of proximal forearm which states were itching. Stated one hyperemic non raised lesion on proximal ventral forearm (that latest lesion was not visualized by me). I extended the observation period and at 45&#39; the lesions started to fade away and the &#34;bumps&#34; got smaller. I did a full evaluation of the patient and there was no other skin lesions on rest of her body. she was breathing normally, no wheezings, no laryngeal stridor, no facial/neck/lips/tongue swelling, no complaints of tingling on lips or tongue. She was not on distress. No treatment provided to patient. Patient was discharge home with specific instructions to call 911, go to neares ER, or call the Duty HS if at any point she develops any new symptoms, breathing problems. Around 6:15 i call patient and told me she was doing good, no new skin lesion, no laboured breathing, wheezing, swelling, problems with swallow and that the lesions were gone. Today 4/6/21 I call patient to come to the clinic for re-assessment and there was no skin rashes, no swelling, her exam was completely normal. she complained of tender arm and that previous night she had some mild headache, took tylenol and better. There was no redness around injection site. Patient was discharged with same recommendations provided previously, to call 911, go to nearest ER, or call Duty HS if any new skin lesions, SOB, wheezing, difficulty swallowing or talking. Just spoke with patient via phone today at 4:25 PM and states she is doing well, no rash, no SOB, completely asymptomatic. I understand the magnitude of these events and I have to say the the misunderstanding was all on me and I take responsibility. Here in our clinic we have immunized over 600 patients and no major issues prior to this. I am available to discuss at any time. Thanks,

A 20-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 20-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 19Jan2021 13:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included lupus and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Concomitant medications included mycophenolate mofetil (CELLCEPT), esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM), medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPOPROVERA), and propranolol; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient has known allergies to rituximab and amoxicillin. As a woman, the patient was having a lot of blood clots being passed. The patient doesn&#39;t get a period because of depo, but for some reason, she was experiencing passing a ton of clots on an unspecified date. Also, after the first dose, when she washed her face, it got extremely red on an unspecified date in 2021 (She did the same in the days before and that didn&#39;t happen). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid test: negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown. No treatment was received for the events. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 11Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation administered at the left arm.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Medical history was reported as none. Ongoing concomitant medication included galcanezumab (EMGALITY injection) monthly; and ethinylestradiol/ norethisterone acetate (HAILEY) daily; both for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date. The patient got the vaccine on 23Mar2021 (Tuesday), then noticed the rash on 24Mar2021 (Wednesday) evening about 9 pm it started in chest and abdomen and over the last couple of days it spread down to some of arms and legs. It&#39;s a mild rash over a decent part of her body. She believed it&#39;s an allergic reaction frankly. She had been taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She was taking it three times now over the last Wednesday. The rash was still there (persisting).

                                                I got a rash like symptom, it looked like mosquito bites ALL OVER  my legs and arms. It itches A LOt and ends up red when I scratch. It ended up actually worsening so I went to urgent care and was told that my immune system was just reacting to vaccine. I was prescribed a stronger benadryl .

                                                I got the shot at 5:05 PM on 4/17/21. My arm was sore and still currently is but is getting less sore. Around 950ish PM my face started to feel a little warm, then about 15 mins later I looked in the mirror and my face was red all over and it continued to get worse. Currently it is 11:20 PM and my face still feels very warm and is a deep red. I would compare it to a bad sunburn. I took my temperature and it was at 99.4.

Accompanying this was a fever of about 100 degrees F. Around the fourth day after the vaccine, the swelling started to abate.

This led to 2 UrgentCare visits and a course of steroid pills (that helped for a few hours before the rash would start to reappear each day) After completing my second dose of the vaccine on April 25th (Lot# EW0169) around 7pm I woke up April 27th with the rash the completely covered my legs/groin/hip area and started spreading up my spinal and trunk as well as swelling fingers, face and lips, resulting in a hospital visit, more steroids and on the morning of April 28th a new rash began on my trunk, arm, neck and face in addition to the hive-like rash on my legs.

The rash spans between my elbows and wrists.

Then, today, her daughter worked up and it looks awful like welts. It looks like welts like maybe she got into poison oak. It was on her face, back, and really bad on her arms. It was just huge welts. It did look worse. Her daughter was really itching. They are going to treat it like chicken pox. It was just a little bit, it did not really bother her daughter, but it looked awful. She was going to give her Benadryl and do an oatmeal bath and calamine lotion. The reporting consumer added she would also ask the pharmacist what else they recommend. The events were serious as medically significant. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 20-years-old female patient (daughter) received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8733, Expiry date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in right upper arm on 20May2021 13:30 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medication was not reported. Patient historical vaccination was Flu vaccine on an unknown date in Sep2020 for immunization and first dose of BNT162B2 lot Number ER8733, Expiry Date: Jul2021 on 29Apr2021 at right upper arm for COVID-19 immunization and patient experienced little sore arm but it was no big deal. On 20May2021 patient experienced sore arms, had chills, her hands were very cold and her fingernails were purple. For a 3 hour period she had low grade temperature of 103.2F. Her heart was racing very fast. The mother gave her Tylenol in 15ml liquid form at 04:00 am and the temperature went down to 2 degrees. Her heart was still racing very fast at 5am. 3 hours later at 08:00 am her temperature was 101.5 F more Tylenol was given but her heart was still racing fast. Later that day it settled down. Her temperature went down to maybe a hundred and heart rate was slowly settling down. The mother said that it was really scary. They had call the doctor on Friday and talked with the nurse two times and the nurse said that they never heard anyone experienced a fever that high with the vaccine. She is asking if this was normal and if anyone has experienced this before. She is asking if ever there would be a third or booster dose, can her daughter take it after experiencing side effects after the second dose. She went back this past Thursday 20May2021 around 1:30pm for the second dose and she felt fine. About 10 hours later that night, she started not feeling well. She had gotten her second dose 3 days before and had a low grade fever, body aches, chills and didn&#39;t feel well for 24 to 48 hours. She started not feeling well and started getting chills. She was shaking really bad at 1:00 in the morning. She really didn&#39;t feel good. She took her temperature and it was 100.5. Her hands were freezing and her finger nails were purple. Her hands were cold and she was getting a fever. She guesses that can happen. Lasted a little longer from 1:00 until about 3:30 in the morning. Caller was up with her the entire night. Her fever went up to 103.2. Her heart was beating really fast. Caller was getting really scared and was thinking about taking her to the emergency room. She thought this was really weird. She gave her Tylenol trying to hold off. She was trying not to give her too much because there are dozens of interactions. She needed to give her something. Within an hour, it brought her fever down about 2 degrees and was then around 101.5. Her heart rate was still pretty fast. Was still a bit concerned but was glad her fever went down. Other than that, she seemed fine. Her daughter was drinking a lot of water to keep hydrated and was peeing a lot because she was drinking so much water. She seemed okay after that but her heart was still beating faster. Her daughter got up, she didn&#39;t sleep very much, and got up around 8:00 am, about 4 hours after taking the Tylenol. She didn&#39;t have a high fever but it was still around 101. She gave her more Tylenol and her heart was still beating fast. Reporter did not time it to see how fast it was. She could just tell that it was beating fast, like she was doing aerobics or something. Her daughter got the shot in her right arm. It really felt lumpy under her arm pit. Caller had read that some people get that, their lymph nodes get inflamed. Consumer only gave those 2 doses of Tylenol, her daughters fever got better. Her heart rate went back to normal and she seems fine now. She said her lymph nodes under her right arm seem like they are feeling better- before, she couldn&#39;t even put her arm down because they hurt so bad. She does seem to have improved; This was last Thursday and this is Tuesday. She did call the doctors office and talked to the nurse who said she hadn&#39;t heard of a fever that high. Said that sometimes when people get a fever, their heart rate can increase and that it is not unheard of. She didn&#39;t think that she had to be seen because she was improving. It bothered her the next few days. She heard on TV that kids were getting heart inflammation. Heart beating really fast: Reporter felt her wrist and felt her heart beating really fast. Lasted a little longer, until about 3:30 in the morning. Her daughters heart was beating so fast, it felt as if she were exercising but, she was sitting still. Her daughter seems fine now and caller has been checking her every day. Arm sore and lumpy under arm pit: This happened the next morning, Friday. Her daughter felt like she couldn&#39;t move and wanted to take a shower. She felt so sweaty and she couldn&#39;t touch her arm pit because it hurt so much. Reporter had read that some peoples lymph nodes get inflamed. It seemed better as the day went on. Treatment: Had  only 2 doses of Tylenol. Her daughter doesn&#39;t swallow pills, so she had given her Children&#39;s strength Tylenol that is for children ages 2-11. She had only given her 15ml, which for her wasn&#39;t a lot. It says it&#39;s for up to 80 pound kids. Gave her 15ml at 04:00 am and it did bring it down 2 degrees. She gave her the same dose at 8:00 am. It wasn&#39;t even an adult strength dose. Fever: Her daughter&#39;s fever went away. She went back to bed, she had only slept from 05:00 am to possibly 08:00am, and didn&#39;t even sleep well then. After the second dose of Tylenol, her daughter went back to bed. Later in the afternoon, when her daughter got up, it seemed like she had a fever but a low grade fever, probably around 100. She hasn&#39;t seen it go back up. It seemed like it had settled down. Caller has been checking every day. Chills: Occurred after the second dose, maybe about 10 hours after on 20May2021.

A 20-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, lot number: EW0191; Expiration Date: Sep2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in Left arm on 22May2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 20-years) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux in the stomach; was diagnosed about one or two years ago. The patient did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the administration of suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing Tri-lo-sprintec (started taking it to regulate her cycle as she had an irregular period; she started this birth control 2 or 3 years ago). On 22May2021, the patient waited 15 minutes after the shot and felt fine, but later on that day (a couple of hours after) she got chills (about three hours after the vaccine). She stated she had normal side effects and did not think anything of it. On Sunday (23May2021), she had difficulty breathing (trouble breathing) and felt weak (feeling very weak and has no energy). She voiced it&#39;s hard for her to wear a mask. When she had to put a mask on it really felt like she could not breathe, and the air feels stuffy especially if she wears a mask; every couple of seconds she had to wear the mask under her nose because she could not breathe. Caller stated that she did not have this problem before receiving the COVID vaccine. On Monday (24May2021), she felt like she was coming down with a cold. Caller stated that she thought that might be her trouble breathing was from her cold-like symptoms, but she does not think it was, because she was not experiencing any cold-like symptoms on Sunday and was only having trouble breathing. She experienced coughing, sneezing, itching eyes/nose, chills, and headache. On Wednesday (26May2021), she started feeling nauseated (got very nauseous), not feeling good, she was getting a headache and had caught a cold. Caller stated she did not know if it was from vaccine shot but her eyes got itchy, her nose got itchy, and she kept sneezing and coughing. Yesterday (26May2021), the chills went away, she has not had any chills today, but she does not know if she will have any from this point on. She believed that she has recovered with lasting effects. Caller stated that not feeling well was ongoing and persisting, but then stated that she feels it was worsening. Yesterday, she just felt nauseous, today she woke up with her stomach hurting very badly and abdominal pain; her weakness has continued. Yesterday she took pantoprazole for the abdominal pain and Tylenol for the pain and headache. She stated that she had a slight headache that is now coming and going, clarifies that it is persisting. Caller thought the reason that her stomach is hurting was because of her stomach acid problem. She deals with a strict diet that she must follow for things she was not supposed to have. Since she had the COVID shot, she believes it was affecting the acid problems in her stomach. Caller clarified that she was calling to see what she should do, if she should go see a doctor or if this is normal. The outcome of events Dyspnoea, Asthenia, Sneezing, Headache, stomach hurting, Itchy was not resolved. The outcome of events of Nausea, started not feeling good, Cold like symptoms was resolving. The outcome of events chills was resolved with sequel on 26May2021, and Cough resolved with sequel on 25May2021. The outcome of Abdominal pain was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                After first shot I just had soreness in my arm.  Before my second shot on 5/13 I had gotten my period 5/3. It had been tappering off by the time I had my second covid shot. When I had received my second vaccination I had zero symptoms except for a sore arm. Thought it would be the same as the first vaccine. Except that I had had my period for over a month now and my suspicions are due to the vaccine. I had to call my OBGYN about it and they also didn&#39;t know what to do. They suggested getting off of my pill for a week and see if it would &#34;reset&#34; anything but instead my body was reacting the same as it did when I was on my birth control. Yes, I have been on my birth control this entire time which is why it is so abnormal. The bleeding is not crazy heavy but enough to wear I would need a tampon some weeks and it likes to disappear and then reappear so I never know whether it is fully over or not. I have read other women having these issues but it only lasting a total of 2 weeks and mine has been happening since 5/13.

                                                Pt received Pfizer-COVID vaccine (under EUA) yesterday 16 Dec 2020 at approx 1700.  She did not have any immediate problems after vaccination.  .  She woke up today feeling achy and feverish, and measured her oral temp at 1000 as 101.4 at home.  She drank fluids, but took no meds -- repeat oral temp at 1200 was 99.0.  .  Other sxms include sore arm at vaccination site with min redness but no swelling.   .  She additionally reports nasal congestion and sore throat that began 1 day prior to vaccination, that she attributed to her seasonal allergies.  No meds for allergies.  No cough or SOB.  No headache or neuro sxms.  No GI sxms.  .  She was concerned about fever and went to drive-thru COVID testing at approx 1300... results due back in 24h.  She has no known COVID contacts.  .  She works in sterile processing at NMCSD with no direct patient contact usually; She is on night shift now.  -  Fever and achy symptoms, as above, in previously healthy hospital worker, with onset approx 18h after receipt of COVID-Pfizer vaccine, dose #1.  With questionable URI-like sxms one day prior to vaccination, COVID testing was very reasonable -- and results are pending now.  If COVID test negative, this most likely represents mild-moderate systemic reaction to vaccine.  Advised no work this evening, rest at home, increase clear fluids, and take Motrin 400mg q4-6h as needed for subjective fever or achiness -- use/precautions reviewed.  Will follow-up tomorrow with this team by phone.  If vaccine reaction, expect sxms to lessen rapidly and resolve over next 1-2 days.  Indications for urgent care -- including marked worsening of sxms or new sxms -- reviewed.  She also has number for 24/7 Immunization Support.  Will file VAERS, since work missed for sxms.  Will encourage enrollment in VSAFE as well.  Advised that, if mild-moderate systemic reaction determined most likely source of sxms, dose #2 of COVID-Pfizer vaccine will still generally be recommended.  Pt expresses understanding and appreciation of all issues.

                                                After receiving the second dosage of my COVID vaccine at 2 PM on 02/03/21, I only had left arm pain near the site of the injection. However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                I had a bumpy texture to the skin of my vaccination site one day after my vaccine. These hives spread to my chest going wide and above the clavicle to the sternum. I took Benadryl on the 12th and on the 13th and no reduction in the hives occurred. They are small skin-tone bumps that are not itchy or irritating. The bumps feel similar to sandpaper in texture. It has been one week past my vaccination and they have not decreased.

She reports a sore, red, hot are at injection site that lasted for 3-4 days and resolved on own.  She reported being in good health until mid February when she noticed sinus/facial pressure, nasal congestion w/nasal voice (no throat issues, just nasal muffling).  She denied any fever, sob, cp, rash, ha, or other systemic symptoms and a HCP placed her on Augmentin.  She completed her AB on 2/20, 2 days before her 2nd covid vaccine.   -------  On 2/22/2021 she received her 2nd Pfizer Covid vaccine to left arm and went back to ER (where she works) for observation.

                                                I noticed when I woke up that I had started to develop a rash on the shoulder where I got the injection. The rash also had a small patch on my left collar. The rash is itchy, small, red, raised bumps, like eczema. It&#39;s now Wednesday and the rash is spreading to other parts of my body: chin, on thigh near groin, thigh near knee, further down left arm, and tonight, my stomach. The rash is spreading in small circular patches and has progressed since Monday.

Around 2:00 on 3/11/2021, patient felt a chill, her temperature was 100.4 F orally. Temperature further increased to 103 F around 13:00 on 3/12/2021.   What happened as a result of the adverse event? (doctor visit, ED or urgent care visit, hospitalization, life threatening illness, disability/permanent damage, death, none of these): none of these, took OTC apap last night and this morning and just took ibuprofen after the 103 F reading.  Spoke with patient&#39;s mother, who stated that the is feeling fine. The patient&#39;s temperature is currently 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and initially came back to normal at 02:00 today (3/13/21). The patient experienced elevated temperatures before that time (02:00), of note was at 22:00 on 3/12/21, at which time the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient&#39;s mother stated that the daughter may have COVID based upon speaking with her doctor, so she inquired if her daughter should be tested for the presence of antibodies against COVID-19. Patient&#39;s mother also inquired if there was a need for the second shot if it was seen that her daughter had antibodies against the virus.  Advised the mother that her questions would be looked into for answers, and that she would be called back with those answers.

Developed slight cough at 9:00pm. I took Benadryl to help sleep through the night in case of any other side effects. Cough went away overnight, but my arm remained sore. I took Tylenol again on 3/26/2021 at 6:30am. At 7:00pm the same day, my left armpit began to feel sore which could not have been caused by anything other than vaccine as I haven?t been doing any physical activity. This worsened the next day, but I have not taken any Tylenol to alleviate it at this point.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the shot, I started to have a bit of swelling in my throat that was almost identical to the reactions I get from foods I am allergic to with my Oral Allergy Syndrome. Another 10-15 minutes later, it had gotten worse to the point where it was harder to swallow, plus I was a bit lightheaded and my mouth was itchy. The people monitoring the post vaccine waiting section didn?t want me walking around, so they sent someone to my car to get my liquid Benadryl, which is what I take for similar reactions to foods. I took about 50-75 mg worth and waited for an additional hour or so until the swelling had gone down mostly. Now (at almost 7 pm on the same day), I still have a tiny bit of swelling in addition to the ?normal? vaccine side effects, tiredness, soreness in my whole body, headache, pain at injection site.

I then went to the ER and got epipen intramusclarly in the ambulance. At the hospital I got steroids and an IV bag. Around 3:30 I started to feel normal again. I stayed under observation for 4 hours. THen got discharged with a prescription of steroids.

                                                Saturday morning, the arm felt sore - I did notice a little red spot. I felt fatigue and a slight headache. Saturday night  to Sunday morning , the spot got bigger (on the injection site). I drew a circle around it. It got a little bigger on Sunday. They other symptoms subsided at the end of Sunday.  The redness didn&#39;t seem to be going away on the injection site. On Monday, I just had the red arm and it hurt pretty bad to touch. It was tender and warm to the touch. I was at work and I felt shortness of breath just walking down the hall. I took my pulse while I was standing still and it was about 120. Near the afternoon, I was instructed to go to URGENT CARE to get it checked out. Closer to the afternoon, I started noticing that the heartrate  (on my watch) it got to 164. I went to URGENT CARE and they stated it was a normal reaction to vaccine but because of my tachycardia they wanted to send me to Hospital ER. At ER they weren&#39;t worried about injection site (still pretty painful) they were worried about how fast my heartrate was going. The wanted me. The injection site and the tachycardia was back to normal.

                                                I had received mosquito bites on my leg a week before I received the first dose of the COVID vaccine. These bug bites were not itching and almost gone when I received the vaccine, however, the night after my vaccine they became very itchy. The next morning, the bites had swelled up, were very hot, itchy and unbearable to manage. They were treated with at home-remedies and over the counter itch medicine. They are almost gone again as of the 27th of April. I took various pictures when they swelled up. My partner received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and also said his bug bites became itchy for the first time since he got the bite.

                                                About 12 hours after the vaccination I started developing a rash. I noticed it at first behind my right knee and as the hours passed it started all over my body, arms, legs, chest, back. It was very itchy. The next day it did not get any better and I went see the nurse at the vaccine clinic at my work where I received the shot at. she looked at the area on my back and arms and legs and suggested Benadryl and OTC hydrocortisone cream.  I have been using it but I still have some rash, some areas it is already drying out and scabbing and I believe it is because one of the ingredients of the vaccine is a polyethylene glycol that is also encountered in penicillin and I get bad rashes if administered penicillin.  Nothing life threatening but the itching is very aggravating and the rashes not pleasant to look at.

The next day I saw the nurse at the vaccine station at my work where I received the vaccine and she looked at my rashes and suggested cold showers, Benadryl and a hydrocortisone cream. I have been applying it but I still have rashes and some have been drying out and scabbing. It is very itchy and the rashes are not pleasant to look at. I intend to see my PCP to see if something else can be done about the rashes. I was reading about the ingredients and I believe it is a polyethylene glycol that the vaccine has and penicillin has too that probably caused the rashes.

They were all over. I am allergic to penicillin, I don&#39;t know and the rash that I got it looked like the one that I get from when I get penicillin. I looked up the ingredients and it seems they have a polyethoglycol like penicillin. I consulted with the nurse at the vaccine station and she suggested cold showers,  not get overheated it is not life threatening but it is still going on and some have started scabbing over but they are still here and they are itchy. The nurse also recommended OTC hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl but it has not really effective. I am thinking about going to see my PCP to se of something else can be done about it.

                                                About one week after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, I developed a rash on two fingers of my left hand that itches. I used OTC hydrocortisone cream on it, which relieved the symptoms temporarily. Rash is still present today. I received the second dose of the vaccine yesterday, 1/9/2021, in my right arm, and today I noticed the rash is spreading to my right hand. I have not had any previous adverse reactions to any other vaccine. I went to urgent care today and the nurse practitioner recommended me to take Benadryl 25 mg at night to relieve symptoms.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261) at right arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Historical Vaccine included unspecified flu vaccine taken in Oct2020 for immunisation. The patient experienced bleeding after shot and bruise on 21Jan2021. The patient said she got her first dose last night and after the pharmacist finished and pulled the needle out there was quite a lot of blood after she pulled the needle out, and there was a bruise there. She didn&#39;t know if a blood vessel got nicked when all that happened. She would like to know if the dose was efficacious or if it is possible some of the vaccine came out with the blood. The patient said that the bleeding from the injection stopped probably within just a minute after she gave it or less, and there was no treatment given. The outcome of event bleeding after shot was recovered; of event bruise was unknown.

Eyes felt swollen a few hours after receiving vaccine between 1-2 pm. Symptoms went away. At around 11pm I got welts and hives all over my body but they were particularly prevalent at the vaccine site. No change in routine throughout the day nor a change in food. Largely went away by the next day around 1pm. Still experiencing slight itchiness.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 17:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Nurse stated her daughter received her first Pfizer vaccine on 06Jan2021 around 5:30 pm. The patient&#39;s signs and symptoms began shortly after receiving the shot. That evening at 19:00, she had very itchy eyes, the next morning (07Jan2021) she woke up with swollen eyes, a rash on her forehead, around her eyes and both cheeks. She took benedryl and zyrtec on 07Jan2021. The symptoms clear up by 10Jan2021, following a visit to her HCP, on 08Jan2021. She received a steroid shot, a prednisone dose pack her HCP. Her HCP recommended she not take dose 2 and instructed her mother to call Pfizer for recommendations. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021.  The  reporting nurse considered the case as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events of swollen eyes, itching eyes and rash on face were likely related to first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), due to plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The rash consisted of redness, small bruise spots and extreme itching. I self treated myself by taking several cool showers and took acetaminophen two times two capsules. On the second day, blotches are subsiding but I have fatigue and weariness in limbs. Skin is less red but has a sallow color and blotchy which is unusual.

                                                I started with a red rash over both arms centered around the elbows-more intense on my shot arm about four days after vaccination .  Then on the fifth day I took a shower and experienced burning on my skin when I got out my entire arms were red and splotchy. I applied lotion and took allergy medicine because it was also itchy. Further on my skin became abrasive in that area and then it started to spread every where on my body-legs, stomach, under my chin, arms, butt, and chest. Then my body started to peel excessively-almost as if I was sunburnt-I could rub my legs and tons of flakes came off. I used copious amounts of oil, lotion, and still continue to take an allergy pill and it has been a full week since it first started, and it is not getting better.-in fact it keeps spreading. I have not changed any products or switched medicine or been exposed to any other environment during this time.

                                                From the beginning, I had extremely enlarged lymph nodes and felt fatigued. Every day my lymph nodes grew until they were the size of golf balls. On Tuesday morning at 2:30 AM, I began to have a fever and developed a mild full body rash. This severely escalated and by Wednesday, I developed full body hives and uncontrollable fevers as high as 105. Since then, I have been anti-histamines and steroids, which made my rash worse but helped the fever and lymph nodes. My hives are painful, itchy, and getting worse.

In the following 10 to 15 minutes my lips started tingling and my throat started to tighten up. The itching finally stopped after 10 minutes. The tingling in my lips and throat tightening occurred with both the first and second dose. The staff kept me for around 45-50 minutes for both doses of the vaccine.  When going home I took 2 Benadryl.

Was with her mom, in case she had an issue. Vaccination without incident.  Kept pt at the vaccination area to observe.  About three minutes after receiving the vaccination, pt started to shake.  Was conversing.  Stated she was warm, so got her a cold bottle of water.  Stated she was dizzy so helped her to the floor to lay down.  She had contractions of her hands, which she stated that they were numb.  She recovered from the dizziness, but then had a panic attack.  Her BP was normal, but her heart rate became elevated.  Had her lay down until she felt better, helping to slow her breathing.  After about 40 minutes,p t felt good enough to sit in the recovery area.  Ensured she had water and some food to help prevent a blood sugar drop.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving vaccine, patient experienced diffuse hives on upper torso (chest &amp; back) and bilateral upper arms (more pronounced on injection site arm).  Patient did not have any signs of increased work of breathing, swelling, or respiratory distress.  MD was called to assess patient.  Per MD, 50mg Benadryl PO was administered.  About 30 minutes after Benadryl was given, hives had improved and patient also verbalized that she felt better.  In total, patient was monitored for close to an hour after Benadryl was given.  Vitals were stable, and patient was cleared by MD to leave.  Patient was instructed not to drive home, so her mother picked her up.

                                                Three days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, I woke up with a hives-like rash. This was specifically concentrated at both my elbows and both my knees. Here there were red, itchy, risen bumps about 1 cm in diameter. As you moved along the limb away from the concentrated regions, there were similar bumps smaller in size, about 1/4 cm in diameter. I also have a few bumps on my lips. The edges of my ears are also red and itchy. It has been one day since these appeared and I have taken one allergy pill, one Benadryl, and have applied hydrocortisone twice. The rash/hives have not improved or worsened as they appear visually.

                                                Although I did experience extreme headaches and a sore arm within days of getting the vaccine in addition to continuing &amp; excessive fatigue, a little over a week later I had an extreme, painful skin outbreak all over my body. I&#39;m assuming my eczema flared up in reaction to the vaccine, but up until that day my eczema had been dormant and restricted to a mild dry patch on my arm and leg joints. Within an hour, I had red spots and red patches appear all over body, including my stomach and back, where I hadn&#39;t had an eczema outbreak in years. My neck was swollen and became extremely wrinkly in appearance, as did my elbows and anywhere else I itched. Although that night was the most abrupt and extreme part of the reaction period, it took 3 days for the flare-up to calm down, the duration of which I was incredibly itchy and experiencing some pain. I took several Benadryl tablets the next day to help calm the itchiness before bedtime.

Felt very restless and sick during night, by the next morning symptoms really sat in.  March 24, 2021: Went to Urgent Care due to fever. Had COVID-19 test (negative). Very close to passing out there (put head between knees and did not). Was sent to emergency room immediately due to heart rate (high 140s-150s. Highest known was 152 BPM). ER performed following: portable chest x-ray, blood tests, urine tests, EKG. Was told results were all normal with the exception of EKG (not told anything about it, form listed as abnormal). Passed out 2x at hospital. Was given one IV rehydration solution and released that night. Symptoms below lasted for several days: Headache Aches Nausea Aggressive shakes Shortness of breath Confusion Dizziness Site pain (also developed bump under arm) Fever - 103.8 (after 2 Advil, 2 Tylenol, 3 ice packs and eating frozen grapes) Heavy sweats Racing heart Restless  March 30, 2021: Still having frequent heart palpitations (they come and go but happen several times during the day. Keep having very high heart rates). Went to doctor. While there, nurse noted irregular heartbeat that sounded like it was ?skipping a beat? and heart rate was also jumping all over the place (high pace, low pace, high, etc.). It was clear something was abnormal. Doctor gave EKG approximately 20 minutes later, EKG looked normal. Was told to come back next morning for blood work and to cut out caffeine.  March 31, 2021: Came in for blood work to check thyroid.  April 6, 2021: Thyroid results were normal. Still having palpitations among other symptoms (see April 12 for more info) so was told to come in. Was given ?work from home? note and referred to cardiologist.  April 12, 2021: Appointment at cardiologist. Still having severe palpitations, occasional dizziness/ lightheadedness, nausea, shortness of breath, exhaustion and chest pain. Heart rate was recorded this day to have gotten up to 139 BPM-- was very high majority of the day. EKG was normal (with exception of high heart rate) but 30 mins later doctor observed high heart rate and abnormal rhythm. Was told to come back in a week and one day for a heart ultrasound and heart monitoring for three days. Still no caffeine intake since 3/30/21. Previous heart rates taken at doctor&#39;s visits over the years for comparison below. Never had any prior heart problems whatsoever:  8/29/18: 70 BPM 9/17/18: 88 BPM 10/17/18: 64 BPM 10/31/18: 73 BPM 1/21/19: 78 BPM Note: At this point, I have missed over a  week and a half of work, and worked from home for over a week. I&#39;m not any better heart wise at all over the course of three weeks post vaccine.

                                                Around 2 hours after the shot, I had moderate pain in the shoulder where I received the shot. When I woke up the next morning, I had continual arm pain, severe chills, nausea, exhaustion, and a headache. These symptoms were reduced with 800mg of acetaminophen every 4-6 hours. The symptoms started to get better at around 9:00pm. The following morning, all symptoms were gone except for a very mild discomfort in my shoulder where the shot was.

                                                About five to ten minutes after I received my first shot, I started to feel like my throat was closing a little. I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

The rash started to swell and increase in redness hours after that, and the next day the swelling and redness continued to increase. The swelling, redness, and pain continued to worsen over the next day until the welt reached about 3inches in height and 3inches across. The skin reaction formed a perfect circle around where I was injected. It has been around 78 hours and the welt is still very large, very red, very swollen, and very itchy. It also feels hot to the touch. No medicines have been able to assist with the swelling or pain, and cold compresses, ice, and heat also do not make the swelling or pain go down.

                                                Patient received the 1st COVID vaccine (Pfizer, Lot #: EW0173, and expiration date: 08/2021) at 2:55 PM. Patient received the vaccine while sitting in the zero gravity chair, due to a history of feeling lightheaded and passing out with needles. After a few minutes in the zero gravity chair, patient expressed that she was feeling good and wanted to sit in the observation area next to her boyfriend. She got up and walked to another chair without assistance and with a steady gait.  EMT made contact with the patient at 3:12 PM, while she was sitting in the observation area. Patient was conscious, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation but complained of &#34;lightheadedness.&#34; EMT grabbed a wheelchair and patient was then transferred to wheelchair, without assistance. At 3:15 PM, baseline vital signs were taken, while patient was sitting: blood pressure: 136/82, heart rate: 108, respiratory rate: 18. Skin was cold, dry, and normal for ethnicity. Patient claimed to have anxiety and explained that fainting and lightheadedness was &#34;common&#34; for her after receiving a shot. Patient denied taking any medications or having any allergies. A second set of vital signs were taken at 3:20 PM: blood pressure: 136/86, heart rate: 108, respiratory rate: 18. Skin was moist, warm, and normal for ethnicity. Patient was negative for orthostatic pressures. EMT advised patient to stay an additional 30 minutes for further observation. Around 3:50 PM, patient was asked how she was feeling and she stated &#34;good.&#34; EMT educated the client on what to do if additional signs and symptoms developed and when to contact her provider. EMT also explained the use of V- safe to the patient. Patient then left the vaccination site, unassisted and with a steady gait.

A 22-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8731) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, premature ovarian failure and covid-19. Concomitant medications were not reported. After the second shot the patient received in Apr2021, she was sitting for the 15 minutes after the vaccine and her right foot was numb and tingling. Her left foot was fine. At home after the vaccine the patient had her feet propped up and her toes were purple.  They did not think about it being any type of side effect from the Covid Vaccine; they thought maybe her foot was wrapped too tightly. On Monday, 26Apr2021, her big toe on her left foot now has the same stinging, burning, pain that the right toe had in it when this all began. Her toes on both feet are still turning purple off and on.  The doctor says that since when they are pressed the purple goes away then comes back it is okay. Both feet were swollen at one time.  The swelling has decreased in the right foot; but continues in the left. It was believed that the patient was suffering from neuropathy. The patient was recovering from the event peripheral swelling. The outcome of the events was pain in extremity and skin coloring was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

It continually worsened throughout the afternoon and evening, despite bedrest and proper hydration, and I could barely sleep.  However, the next morning I woke up just as I did the day before - no problems, feeling fine.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at 12:00 in left arm as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination), family medical history relevant to adverse events, concomitant medications, other products and investigation assessment were not reported. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Historical vaccines included flu vaccine and tetanus vaccine which caused sore arm. It was reported that the patient received the COVID vaccine around noon at 12:00 on 28Jan2021 at work and had swelling and redness at the injection site the size of a golf ball. The site of injection was red, a little raised, and warm to touch. She asked if it was normal and was there anything she could look out for. She stated it had been really sore, but she did not look at it because she had long sleeves on. She first noticed it around 16:00 on 29Jan2021. There was no emergency room or physician office visit. Relevant tests were not reported. The outcome for the event vaccination site pain was unknown and for all other events was not recovered/not resolved.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information was expected.

This happened spontaneously over the course of about 2 weeks. The hives started to die down but seemed to be triggered by cold after the first few days. I have not had hives since the two weeks passed, but the weather also warmed up so the cold stimulus hasn&#39;t been present.

This nurse reported similar events for 3 patients. This is the first of 3 reports.  A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away. She reported that this one is medically significant because even though she did not have shortness of breath, it could have affected her airway. She confirmed that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;had a tightness and lump in her throat&#39;, allergic reaction was not recovered (a s reported); while recovered on 27Dec2020 for allergic reaction like rash/red rash on her chest and rash was on her arms too and cheeks were flushed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events throat tightness, sensation of foreign body, allergy to vaccine, rash erythematous and flushing cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

On 01/08  ~5 PM I began to develop  a fever that reached a peak of 102.4 at 4am (01/09), despite taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Last fever recorded 01/09 ~9PM of 99.5 (while still taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours).  Additional symptoms have been severe nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, bilateral lower back pain with some mild bruising to the kidney region, difficulty breathing,  chest pressure, shortness of breath along with a cough upon exertion (developed ~6 PM 01/08), which is still present today (01/10 1:25 PM), and an erythematous rash that covers the anterior side of the right forearm, from wrist to elbow (first noticed on 01/10 ~11 AM).

Rash continued to spread to lower back and stomach over the next few days with the left arm being the most affected area. Facial redness and swelling occurred however breathing was never affected.  Benadryl did not provide much relief. Visited an urgent care which classified it as an allergic reaction and started 5 day course of prednisone on 12/28/2020. Symptoms resolved upon completion of the prednisone. Total duration of symptoms was approximately one week. I had not used any new skin products or eaten any foods new to my diet and nothing else comes to mind as a potential contributing factor.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Dec2020 (at the age of 23-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: allergies to medications, food, or other products (unspecified). It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well. The patient was taken to the emergency department for ongoing observation. The patient was released from emergency department after observation. The clinical outcome of flushed, hives, tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;, and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events flushing, urticaria, tong disorder, sensation of foreign body are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

                                                Vaccines received in series on 12/11/20 and 1/11/21. Three days before due date for second COVID vaccine, started severely itching and experiencing hive-like rash all over body, especially to hands and head; mostly relieved by benadryl but wore off every 6 hours. Contacted PCP (listed in form) who suggested taking zyrtec and using a moisturizing lotion. This helped for the day of receiving the vaccine. Thinking it was something unrelated due to the time elapsed from the vaccine, despite no changes in consumption or products/environment encountered, I went ahead and got the second vaccine. Day 1 after vaccine, I experienced the usually reported side effects, including slightly elevated temp, chills, and body aches. Itching and hives continued but not as noticeable due to other side effects. The next morning, hives and itching were significantly worse; any time I scratched (or something touched my skin more than lightly), large, red welps would nearly immediately develop, and often had raised bumps within the irritations. To date, this is continued, slightly relieved by allergy medications, but not entirely and must be taken around the clock or severe symptoms will begin again.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after the vaccination the patient reported dizziness and possible rash on her upper chest. It was difficult to assess if the rash was truly a rash or it was simply skin lesions that were already present (patient claimed she did not know). It did not resemble a maculopapular rash. It marginally resembled minor hives/urticaria. Patient did not report any localized symptoms at injection site. Patient was informed to remain seated and that her vitals would be taken and she would be further observed. Then about 10 minutes after this (25 minutes after vaccination), patient reported difficulty breathing. Facial redness was noted at this point and patient&#39;s breathing sounded difficult. Emergency medical services were called and EpiPen was administered at this point. Patient began to tremble and pace of breathing increased. Emergency medical technicians arrived, took vitals / EKG, and assessed the patient. EMT assessment did not reveal urticaria. EMT instructed patient to control her breathing. The EMTs believe that it may not have been a true reaction but rather the patient may have been suffering from an anxiety attack. Patient was then taken to local ER for further evaluation.

                                                On 1/20, I got a headache, dizziness, and my arm was extremely sore. Within about an hour, I became extremely nauseous and had both chills and sweats. I took my temperature at 6:00 pm on 1/20 and it read 99.7. I then took tylenol and at 8:30, I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. My normal temperature is 97.2-97.5. I took an ice bath at this point as my arm at the injection site was extremely swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. I called urgent care to see what medications I could take in addition to tylenol and they recommended motrin to bring down my fever. I woke up several times through the night and took medication. At around 8 am on 1/21, I took my temperature and it was 97.8.

                                                First 2 days after vaccination, I had some injection site pain that was improving. Day 5 after vaccination, I developed lymphadenopathy on my left side with swelling into the chest area developing on day 6. Day 8 after vaccination, my injection site turned red and itchy and I began to have trouble breathing. I went to urgent care.  I saw P. A. She said that it was more likely that the difficulty breathing would be due to my asthma, but she could not recommend whether or not I should receive my second dose. She proscribed 20mg of Prednisone and refilled my albuterol prescription. About 20 hours later, my breathing is still difficult and my arm still itches.  We also discussed that the respiratory symptoms could be caused or exasperated by COVID-19, so I am waiting on results from a covid test.

The patient medical history was unknown. Concomitant drug  was Sertraline and Mili tablets. Within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine the patient received the vaccine TDAP on 08Jan2021 in the right arm. On 20Jan2021 at 09:00 PM the patient experienced injection site pain, chills, headache, body aches, nausea, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue. These started about 12-14 hours after getting the vaccine and worsened over the next several hours. Most symptoms resolved, but she still had swollen, tender lymph nodes in the neck and armpits as well as some mild body aches and headache (at the 48 hour mark). No treatment was received. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Rash, just progressed worse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 23-year-old female consumer reported that received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number EL3249), at single dose into left arm on 17Jan2021 6at :00 p.m for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant drugs were none. The patient reported experiencing a rash. The rash started on her wrist and has just progressed worse in the past few days. She got her shot on Saturday. Her rash fist appeared on Sunday or Monday, she cannot totally recall. The rash has continued to progress worse. Caller states the rash was all over the body. The caller states she has to assume this is a reaction to the vaccine, it&#39;s too coincidental not to be. The caller is just wondering if there is any information on what she can do about the rash, if it is safe to get the second vaccine and if she can receive a steroid shot. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                The shot went in my arm and I immediately started feeling itchy. Before the needle was out, I knew something was wrong but almost didn?t believe how fast it happened. My throat started itching and swelling shut. I was in full blown anaphylactic shock in less than 2 minutes. I got an EpiPen shot in the parking lot and was admitted into the hospital where I continued having various reactions. A week after the shot, I?m still breaking out in hives uncontrollably.

No nausea, no difficulty with swallow, no SOB.   No other reported symptoms.  cough virtual visit was conducted with the patient.  I stopped the Augmentin as she had been on the course for 5 days,  I encouraged OTC Cetirizine 10 mg daily.  Pt was advised that if any evolving difficulty with swallow, any chest discomfort or evolving shortness of breath - ER.  The patient also has a standing referral to follow-on with Urology regarding her recurrent UTIs.  I advised the patient that this may or may not be a reaction to the vaccine.

                                                About 1.5-2 hours post immunization the patient returned having developed a headache and a quarter sized welt that was lightly red, swollen and very tender to touch, just below her left collar bone about 4 inches from the injection site. The welt was outlined and observed and the patient was given 25mg of Benadryl. After about 20 minutes the swelling and tenderness had spread to an area approximately the diameter of a tennis ball. At this point she was refered to see a doctor at the Health Center. The nurse called to follow-up once the patient arrived as she had not seen this type of reaction after the vaccine. After discussion the physician was going to look at her. Reportedly the swelling had begun to retract and the patient apparently returned to work later that day, talking about her plans to receive the second dose.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

                                                29 minutes after being given the vaccine my tongue started itching and swelled up a bit, my mouth felt dry, my face became a bit reddened, puffy, and itchy, my throat began to swell a bit and my chest felt tight, giving me some discomfort when it came to breathing. I let the nurses who were keeping an eye on those waiting for 15/30 minutes know that I was having a reaction. I waited 1 more minute, and when my throat felt tighter and I had a bit more difficulty breathing, I took 1 Benadryl tablet, and waited 2 minutes, and when the symptoms were still worsening slowly, I took a second Benadryl tablet and after a few minutes my symptoms started to go away.  I waited another 10 minutes and then went home when it seemed that my symptoms were going away.  At 6:45pm on 2/21/2021 my throat and chest started feeling tight again and gave me mild breathing discomfort, so I took another Benadryl tablet, a few minutes later my face began to itchy and my mouth felt dry and my tongue felt a bit swollen, whereupon I took a second Benadryl tablet at 6:56pm, and then felt a wave of nausea.  At 6:59pm, the feeling of tightness had not abated, but also hadn&#39;t worsened noticeably, and the itching feeling began to spread from my face to my ears and down my neck.  At 7:04pm the tightness of my throat and chest began to increase some, and I started to feel some anxiety.  At 7:11pm I inhaled two puffs from an albuterol inhaler used for treating asthma as my throat and chest were continuing to slowly get tighter.  At 7:26pm I still felt itchy and my throat and chest still felt tight, but it wasn&#39;t noticeably worse.  At 7:35pm, my throat began to feel tight enough to give me noticeable discomfort while breathing and for me to make a slight wheezing sound while breathing, and my tongue felt like it swelled a bit more, and my mouth still felt dry.  At 7:51pm the Benadryl made me feel sleepy, but had no effect on my itchy skin or tightness of throat or chest.  8:00pm, my throat and chest felt tighter and I started having some difficulty swallowing and I felt very warm.  8:05pm, I had a lot of difficulty swallowing and had trouble breathing, so I went to the Emergency Room and was given an Epinephrine shot and sent home after an hour of observation.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I felt extremely lightheaded, eyes were blurry for 5-10 minutes, and extreme sweating all over my body. These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

A 23-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (vaccine location=left arm) on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization at a workplace clinic. Medical history included unspecified allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. She was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient experienced sore arm after injection, nausea, muscle aches, headache, and fatigue on 01Feb2021. No treatment received for the events. The events were reported as non-serious (did not result to death, not life threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, and not congenital anomaly/birth defect). Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

Hasn?t gone down yet, but it?s about the size of an apple. Slight fever in the evenings. On night 11, bumpy rash on the neck and back were visible. I felt better after taking a Zyrtec and inhaler. Neck/back rash have gone away but the injection site is still inflamed. It?s a 3 inch circle on my left arm with the injection site at the center. I have no reason to believe it?s a bruise, I have not bumped that area of my left arm anytime within the past month. To the best of my knowledge, I haven?t taken anything that would trigger an allergy

Some rash marks by chin, disappeared after a few days but bumps remain 2) Left arm - red &amp; white bumps on back of left hand, and inside of left forearm. 18 small bumps total  3) Left leg - 4 small red bumps around knee and on left thigh  These bumps occurred a few days after receiving the Pfizer shot, and after a full week past injection, bumps are still apparent.

                                                The first day I got my vaccine, I felt  fine, but my arm with the injection sight was very sore and body slightly achy. The second day I woke up and my arm was sore, but other than that I felt normal. Around 4pm on the second day, my back started to hurt where the break break in my spine is. It was just a normal amount of pain at first, but within an hour there was throbbing pain in my lower back, spreading into my legs. This is where I normally feel my chronic pain, but I had a spinal injection a little over 6 months ago and doesn&#39;t usually stop working until about a year. It is the normal pain I experience in the normal places, but the pain is worse and out of no where. That is not usually how the pain comes on when the spinal block wears off. It is much more gradual. It could be a coincidence, but the pain is not the way I have ever experienced the pain.  My back hurts too much to do things I need to do to function, which only happens to me when I have done something with a lot of physical activity that puts tension on my back like jumping, dancing, roller coasters. Before I started experiencing this pain, it was just a normal day for me where I didn&#39;t exert my back any more than normal, which is very little.

I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

This morning I woke up fine but this afternoon my arm felt hot and looked down and noticed a bright red rash that?s 4 inches in width and about 1 inch tall on my arm. Since noticing it has not gone down in size but maintained. My arm is swollen at the injection site as well as extremely warm and somewhat painful.

                                                Four days after my second dose, I woke up to hives on my back thighs. It then spread all over my legs, up my back and behind, and on my arms. I immediately called my doctor and he told me to use over-the-counter antihistamines such as Benadryl/diphenhydramine for Claritin 10 mg once or twice daily, or Zyrtec 10 mg once or twice daily or alternating Claritin and Zyrtec for more severe cases and supplementing with diphenhydramine 25 mg every 6 to 8 hours.  My doctor believes the reaction was due to my second COVID vaccine.   I ended up taking 2 pills of the 12 hour Allegra 2x a day, depending on when the hives would start up again. Two in the morning and two at night.

                                                After receiving vaccine at 3 pm I started to have anxiety and my heart rate went up. This was presumably because I also have a needle phobia but I did almost faint and had to have on site EMT asses condition and observe for 30 minutes. At 4 pm one hour after injection face felt itchy and irritated and noticed hives on neck and jawline. Immediately administered benadryl 50 mg which made the hives subside.

                                                While waiting in after the vaccination I experience the slightest discomfort with my breathing but thought it might be related to double masking. Upon driving home, I realized I had non-itchy and non-painful hives on the upper portion of my right cheek and the lower jaw on the left side. As time progressed, the hives disappeared from left side and moved down the right side of my face. After it passed on the right side it reappeared on the left side and followed the same pattern. My dermatographia also returned on my chest and I haven&#39;t had an episode of it for over year. The roof of my mouth was also itchy. All hives, itchy mouth, and slight breathing discomfort passed by 7 pm without the use of an antihistamine. No other signs of allergic reaction has been noted since. Breathing concerns passed the quickest (after 2 or so hours), then itchy mouth, and last the non-itchy hives. Other than that, I experienced the common side effect of body aches during the night and pain in vaccinated arm.

                                                It started when I woke up and my eyelids were severely swollen. Then throughout the day the swelling started to go down but then my neck began getting red. I then developed a light rash on my neck, chest, and arms. The only part that was slightly itching was my neck. I continued to take Benadryl and used cortisone cream on my neck. I woke up the next day with my eyelids being swollen again. Benadryl helped. The rash is going down and all I have left is a rash on my left wrist which developed on the 4th day after my vaccine.

Patient had not received other vaccine in four weeks. Patient stated that two weeks after her first dose, on 10Jan2021 she experienced 1-2 hives on her body every day. she worked for an allergist who thought it may be an immune response and recommended her still receive her second dose. 3 days after her second dose, her hives increased severely. The patient had full body hives that are extremely itchy that had not yet resolved and it had been over 4 weeks since her final dose. Her injection site got super red and itchy the day after her second injection, that lasted several days as well. The full body itchiness was unbearable and does not resolved with multiple antihistamines being taken. She had several pictures of the hives that she was willing to share if someone contacted her. Outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                The second the person gave me the shot my index finger went numb, stiff and my range of motion decreased.  Within less than 24 hours day my whole hand and lower arm were stiff, numb,  painful, and tingling. I also have overall weakness and doing basic tasks like writing essays for school has become painful and difficult. My hand is stiff and looks like a claw. While it has gotten a little better after taking medications that my doctor prescribed my fingers are still weak stiff, numb, tingling, and painful.  The vaccine was administered too far up and too far to the left which has most likely caused nerve damage.  There is also a small bruise at the injection site and the injection is still visible 5&#43; days later. This could have been prevented through better training of health officials working at state-run vaccine sites. I hope this hasn&#39;t caused lasting damage.

                                                I noticed a petechia rash on my legs the day after I received the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, April 06, 2021, I noticed the rash spreading around my chest area, neck area, thighs, and arms as the following days progressed. On Friday, April 09, 2021, I made an appointment at the Student Health Center where I was seen by clinician,  who requested I get blood labs done. After results showed that my platelet count was 30,000, she immediately referred me to the ER at Hospital. She informed that it was an adverse side effect to my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she also informed me that it was a very rare instance and there are cases of other individuals that this has also happened to. Dr. informed me my situation was extremely dangerous and could have potentially been fatal if I had not decided to seek medical attention. I was admitted into the  Hospital on April 09, and was discharged on Monday, April 12, 2021. While I was in the hospital, that Friday 04/09 I received a blood transfusion for my low platelet count, it did not show much improvement, I was diagnosed with ITP by clinician  who is a clinician within the Hematology and Oncology department.  Dr. also informed me that this seemed to be an adverse side effect to the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine, Dr.then recommended I receive steroids for 4 consecutive days to increase my platelet count. The date of my discharge 04/12, my platelet count was 20,000 which is still considered extremely low but due to steroids that were given to me for 4 days, Dr.agreed that this would hopefully increase my platelet count.

                                                I (patient) developed swollen and painful lymph nodes in the underarms on both sides of my body. They began on the side of the injection but spread to include both arms. In addition, two similarly swollen and painful lumps have appeared, though I am not sure if they are lymph nodes given their locations. One is along my the line of my waistband in the front of my body, not in the traditional groin area where most charts ascribe lymph nodes to be. One is directly below my areola on my right breast. Along with these lumps, I developed a rash made up of several small, inflamed hives that range from painless, to itchy, to painful. They are concentrated along my bra line, particularly around my breasts, but are spread everywhere from below my neckline to above my ankles. These symptoms began approximately 7 days after my second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and are continuing at the time of this report.

This tickle in the throat  lasted 15 min , and it was gone before she took Allegra .Has noticed intermittent back itching too.

It felt like things were moving in slow motion, frame by frame, when I woke up at 3am. Was light headed, couldn&#39;t stand, chills and shaking. I vomited from 3-4 am and then again at 8am when I woke up, with my visual disturbances limited to the 3-4am hours. I took Advil and was able to go back to sleep for most of the day, sleeping from around 9am to 1pm. Nausea, fever, and vomiting have all have cleared. Now I just have a headache and muscle aches, especially near the injection site. Almost 24 hrs after my vaccine now and I feel drastically better than I did overnight.

Both signs of soreness began around 7pm the evening of the shot. The day after the shot was administered the soreness in the shot site began to lessen but the pain in the armpit persisted. The armpit pain, the day after the shot was administered, felt sore, almost as if I have been holding a golf ball tightly between my arm and torso for hours and a bruise had formed.  That night I checked my armpit to see if there was any swelling or bruising. There was some swelling and a small lump within the tissue of the armpit the night of the day after the shot. The morning of the 23rd , two days after the shot was administered, the armpit pain persisted and the lump was bigger than the night before and the swelling remained.

I left work around 3 pm on 04/22/2021 with major bodyaches and extreme fatigue. Around 4 pm, I felt extremely itchy and found hives all over my arms, legs, above the injection site, cheeks, and butt. All my hives seemed to be worse on my right hand side, the side I received both vaccines in. After taking 2 Benadryl around 4:30 and taking a cold shower, I could feel the cold water turning warm from running off my hives when hitting my feet. No signs of fever. Shortly thereafter, I used Hydrocortisone cream and they left. At 6:30 am I woke up covered again, by 2pm 04/23 they are off and on.

Inflammation all over my body over the course of a week. They are now no longer inflamed or red but seeming to form scars, especially around the calf and ankle areas.

                                                I have several weird red dots on my legs since waking the morning after receiving the vaccine. It&#39;s not horrible, and I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s at fault here, but I was given a handout and told to report any weird reactions on this site. I have the expected low fever (100.1) and body aches, which I was prepared for, but it&#39;s a little weird to me I guess that no one mentioned red dots. They&#39;re not raised or scabbed or filled with any type of fluid, just...itchy, small red dots. They&#39;re only on my legs too. I&#39;m not blaming anyone - believe me, I&#39;d much rather have itchy dots than have COVID! But I thought I should just report it like I was asked. I&#39;m using hydrocortisone cream topically and haven&#39;t seen any improvements yet, but I&#39;m not terribly worried. Just confused, mostly. Thank you

                                                I woke up 6 days after receiving the vaccine and I had some pain at my collar bone. It felt bruised and I felt something that felt like a ball rolling around. I called advice from clinic and they scheduled me a visit with Dr. for a video visit. At my visit with him, I explained what it was and I mentioned that I heard about lymph node enlargement after the vaccine. He told me that he hadn&#39;t heard anything about that, but scheduled an ultrasound for me. I scheduled an appt with my PCP and she told me that she did hear about the lymph node enlargement from the vaccine. I had the ultrasound on 03/30 and the results came back benign. Dr. called with my results and requested a follow up in 3 months.

This old female consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported patient (daughter). A 23-year-old female patient (age at vaccination: 23 year) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number was not reported and expiry date: 31Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 01Jun2021 at 09:30, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was taking Pfizer Covid Vaccine because just for health protection and for work. Vaccine administered was not at facility. There was no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient&#39;s medical history included patient breaks out in hives (so they were just wanting to watch her closely with this), allergic to amoxicillin, and Keflex family of medicines (patient was 3 years old). There was no family medical history relevant to adverse events and no other relevant tests. Concomitant medications included amoxicillin and keflex (CEFALEXIN MONOHYDRATE). The reporter was calling on behalf of her daughter who received the first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine about an hour ago. About an hour and a half ago, there was a strange pattern on the upper half of her right thigh, whole area feels very warm on 01Jun2021. Almost a leopard look, not like a regular rash on an unknown date. She just wanted to get Pfizer&#39;s input and see about the side effects seen and stated they noticed it like 5 minutes ago, it&#39;s staying steady right now. The reporter asked has this been reported as a side effect and did she need to get her in to see someone or did we need to get ready for an allergic reaction. The reporter got response as I would not be able to say if she was having a severe allergic reaction or not and suggested they reach out to her HCP to ask if she needs to come in to be seen or if they should go to the emergency room. There was a product complaint. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

The fever went from 100.1 to 102.2 over the course of about an hour (11:30pm-12:30pm), at which time I took 400mg of ibuprofen. The fever was 102.1 thirty minutes after taking the ibuprofen. Along with the fever I experienced tachycardia, body and muscle aches, and moderate to severe deltoid pain at the injection site. I believe the fever broke around 3:00am. The fatigue and body aches lasted about 24 hours since they began, but the majority  of the rest of my symptoms were gone after the fever. The arm pain at injection site was noticeable and painful for about 72 hours before subsiding.

I do have little bit pain on it; Vaccine administrator put the vaccine in the wrong part of the arm; She put further behind her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 24-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acne. Concomitant medication included spironolactone for acne. The patient was reporting an adverse reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She had two concerns. One concern was that she found that the vaccine administrator put the vaccine in the wrong part of the arm, she said, she put further behind her arm, these were her words and she complains that her right leg hurts when she sits down. She said, she works 12 Hours a day and the pain starts shooting down from her arm to her leg, the injection site is red and swollen and she was not taking any medication to alleviate the symptoms. On 31Dec2020, it was reported that the patient was little bit concerned the area, she stated, &#34;I know it is supposed to be swollen for few days but today it is still swollen, its red. I do have little bit pain on it but I was a little bit concerned because I was told by my coworkers and nurses. I am not sure they put it in the right area so I guess the nurse administered the vaccine, she put it like instead of like where they normally put the vaccine, she put it at the side of my arm like, not like behind my arm like normally, I was a little bit of concerned. Another symptom that I have been feeling that whenever I sit down my left leg hurts so much like I have been on my feet like, I am working for 12 hours straight away so I have been working on my feet for pretty much the entire day so every time I sat down only my side hurts, on the side where I take the vaccine, I don&#39;t know if there is everything to do with that, it is like tolerable pain but (sentence incomplete).&#34; No treatment for the events. The outcome of the events injection site is red and swollen was not recovered and unknown for the other events.  Information on batch number has been requested.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

They gave me medicine for the pain and the doctor said I was having a adverse reaction to the vaccine but by the next day I would feel better. I went home and slept after the ER all day and night and by Sunday 01/31/2021, I was feeling better after excedrine and advil

                                                I had several adverse side effects from the vaccine (which I was expecting given it was my second dose). I woke up with a slight fever that lasted two days (highest point being 102.5*F, but it ebbed and flowed throughout the period). I had nausea (threw up twice, was able to keep food down by the evening of the first day after getting the vaccine). I had chills as well, and standard body aches and headaches that often accompany fevers and chills. My arm was also sore at the injection site, as with most vaccines, but it was actually bizarrely most sore at my armpit, not at the injection site.

                                                I had nerve pain 8 on pain scale on 1/7, mostly centered on my back along my spine but when it was at its worst it was anywhere my skin was in contact with anything. First started feeling like my back itched at around 6:30pm. At 8:30pm, I started feeling exhausted and feverish. I took my temperature, it was 100.6 F, I took acetaminophen (2, 650mg tablets).  My symptoms did not get better and I started having chills and pain like needles stabbing me anywhere my clothes were touching me. I went to bed at around 11pm and tried to sleep unsuccessfully until 3am, tossing and turning in pain anywhere my skin was being touched, before trying ibuprofen (600mg, the dose I take for my migraines) which seemed to help and I finally fell asleep.  Next morning woke up feverish, exhausted, and in pain again. Once again ibuprofen helped and I continued taking it every 8 hours for the next day until my symptoms were no longer coming back when the dose was wearing off. Last ibuprofen was probably 10pm on 1/8.

She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

I tried to rest and take ibuprofen but nothing was helping the pain and I went to my health center a week after I received the vaccine and they said I was having too much of a localized inflammatory response and to alternate between ibuprofen and tylenol and use heat but the pain is still there and it&#39;s been almost 3 weeks.

                                                Anaphylaxis - Throat swelled almost completely closed, wheezing, lightheadedness (nearly passed out), throat/neck and injection site were very itchy and swollen, face/eyes swelled up, turned very pale all over, heart palpitations, etc. The next day - severe, horribly painful burning sensation all throughout my body.  Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I am now 30 weeks pregnant and the reason I went to see my hematologist is because my platelets dropped. I had lab work done the week of 02-22-2021 through 02-26-2021. I also had soreness at the injection site and a palpable lymph node under my armpit that was present for 24 hours then it resolved. I will also be receiving treatment with IV, IG and prednisone medication starting this week of 03-15-2021 through       03-19-2021.

                                                Left deltoid pain began at about 2:30 pm, approximately 3 hours after vaccine was administered in that arm. Pain progressed throughout the next few hours but was moderate. Around 11:30 pm the pain became more severe, to the point where any deltoid movement caused extreme pain. I used an ice pack to try to alleviate the pain but it only provided mild relief. When changing my shirt around this time I touched the area lightly and saw it was slightly swollen with fluid around the site of vaccination. Continued using ice because I had not eaten recently and did not want to take ibuprofen on an empty stomach and cause heartburn. I was unable to sleep on my left side and woke up around 4:30 am in severe pain, put ice on it again and fell back asleep. I had a low grade fever of about 99.4 F at this time and some chills. On 3/16 I woke up around 9:30 am and pain was still fairly moderate-severe and swelling was present but less than the night before. Around 10:00 am I ate breakfast and took ibuprofen, and the pain and swelling have been more moderate since.

                                                After my second dose of Pfizer vaccine, I developed fever, chills, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, hypersensitive skin to touch (not a rash, but my skin is more sensitive and a light rubbing on skin all over my body could cause pain).  I also had several series of premature heart beat.

This lasted for about 15 minutes. 45 minutes after shot the same issue occurred with the left side of the throat

A 24-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) at left arm on 15Feb2021 (24-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. There were no concomitant medications in two weeks. The patient did not received any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) at left arm on 25Jan2021 at 09:00 (24-year-old at time of vaccination) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced red and hot rash on the same arm (located in the crease of the elbow and about 5 inches in diameter) from 01Feb2021 at 08:00; received cortisone for the rash (it got better). Rash got worse again a few days after second dose in Feb2021. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient did not test COVID post vaccination. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event and included cortisone. The outcome of the event was recovering.

I went to my kitchen to get water and passed out, dropping the glass I was in the process of getting from the cabinet, and I crashed. I felt so horrible I just tried to get back to my bed at that point without getting water. I passed out again trying to get back to my bed, bruising my right knee and my ribs.  One the most horrible feelings I have experienced. I stayed on the floor for a bit recovering the second spell. My sister heard the commotion and quickly brought me water and Tylenol.  My head felt full of pressure that I couldn?t get rid of by holding my nose and blowing. Eventually that went away. I stayed in bed for the rest of the day drinking water and Gatorade. I felt like I had an intense flu for the remainder of the day with chills and fever. The following day I needed more sleep but felt better.  Now today, Saturday I feel better, but I still feel shocked at how intense my body?s reaction was to the second dose.

                                                My hair began to fall out a week after my second dose of the vaccine. It may be unrelated, but I wanted to report it just in case.  I had a fever from the night of 03/31/21 to 01/02/21 that was managed well with tylenol. I had hot flashes, chills, and joint pain during this time as well. Aside from my hair falling out, I feel completely fine now. As I said, the hair may be a coincidence as I have an unrelated autoimmune disease.

The only inciting event she can think of was getting her first injection of the pfizer covid vaccine today about 2.5 hours prior (3p) to onset of symptoms.  She denies shortness of breath, nausea, throat tightness or facial swelling.   She has a history of latex allergy but no other known allergies. She used some diphenhydramine cream that provided minimal relief.

Minimal pain until around 3 am, woke up with severe muscle pain that continued to worsen into the next day- 4/14/2021. I could barely move my arm, the pain had me in tears a few times. Accompanied by inflammation surrounding injection site. Used a cold pack on the area within the first 24 hours, it did not help nor did ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or acetaminophen. Used a heating pad on low on the area to help with muscle stiffness, it helped minimally. Today, 4/15, the pain and inflammation is improved greatly but hives developed along with a very mild temperature. Symptoms improving overall

What&#39;s uncommon is that on 4/14/2021, I began to get hives on my stomach and I&#39;ve never had a hives break-out before receiving my second vaccine dose. On 4/15/2021, I wake up with hives all over my back, butt, stomach, shoulders and arms. My daily routine hasn&#39;t changed accept for getting my second vaccine dose. On 4/16/2021, I wake up at 1am with hives all over my body in the same places as 4/15/2021 but now my face was slightly swollen especially around my under eye area.

                                                The day following the immunization patient experienced swollen eye lids and the surrounding areas. She was treating pink eye at the time so she did not attribute the swelling to the vaccine. However, later that day she developed rashes and hives on her torso. She began a regimen of OTC benadryl and self treated at home. She called the pharmacy on Thursday, 4 days post vaccination asking if she needed to do more. The Benadryl was helping but the reaction was ongoing. It was recommended she visit the urgent care to be evaluated and treated appropriately. Her second dose appointment was cancelled.

A 24-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Feb2021 15:15 (at the age of 24-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. Patient had no known allergies. Patient did not receive any other vaccine in two weeks of vaccination. Patient received unspecified other medications in two weeks of vaccination. Patient was not tested for covid prior to vaccination. It was reported that, on 20Feb2021 23:00, patient felt nothing physically until the evening after vaccination. She noticed around 11 PM that she had hives all over her chest (collarbone to bust to armpit) and on her back directly across from the front. They looked like red freckles almost. No pain, no itching, just hives. They were still on her body just less red. Now they look like freckles. Not sure when they developed. Thinking back, she did develop a tickle in her throat within 5 minutes. Patient was not tested for covid post vaccination. Outcome of the events was reported as recovering.   Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                First shot was 3/24/21 and the only side effect was a sore arm near the injection site for 2-3 days.   My second shot was 4/21/21 and the side effects started around 11:30 (about 12 hours after the shot). Started with chills/sweats and a fever. Woke up in the morning dizzy, feverish and chilled. Symptoms lasted all day and fever peaked at 102.1 around 2PM. Slept most of the day off and on. Symptoms were still present 4/23, but much better. I took Advil around 12PM and moderate symptoms remained. Leg muscles started hurting in the afternoon and lasted until mid-day 4/25. Dizzy/light headedness and overall feeling of just being ?slow? has been present since 4/23.

The night after vaccine I got hives, a fever, and chills. Took Benadryl and Asprin and slept. When awoke, fever broke but all the other symptoms began and remained for the entire day. Woke up this morning, all symptoms remain aside from chest pain, though the hives are considerably worse.

                                                Injection site started feeling sore after about four hours. The following day, my arm hurt much worse and the rest of my body began to ache throughout the morning. I developed a fever at 99.5°. Took Advil which helped a lot. Advil started to wear off at about 1:30. At that time, I became nauseous and a little dizzy. I ended up going home early from work because of it. That night, I had such intense pain around my midsection I could barely move and deep breaths such as a yawn hurt way more.

                                                24 hours after first shot, started to develop a rash on face and shoulder. It spread over the course of the next day to the entire body and included both ears turning red and swelling up. Skin hot to the touch and slightly numb. Documented progression of redness and rash on face. Went to see doctor approximately 48 hours after initial shot, advised to take Benadryl and if that does not work or if it gets worse to call back. Advised not to take second dose of vaccine as it is likely an allergic reaction.

The next morning I woke up with extremely itchy bumps and rashes all over my body. On my face, neck, arms, legs, feet, hands, back, stomach. I went to the doctor again the next morning and they gave me hydrOXYzine and hydrocortisone. By the next day I still had hives present on my face, legs, arm and feet, they were not itchy. I continued to have these for about 3 days. I took my medications for 10 days before it was completely gone.

                                                Suspected bursitis with prolonged arm pain and weakness 2 weeks after first Pfizer dose. On the day of vaccination, I had a panic attack and nearly blacked out after vaccination, something that had never happened to me after a vaccination. Once the pain started a few hours after vaccination, it significantly increased. I experienced excruciating pain in my left arm like I had never felt after any other vaccination. Complete inability to move my arm without pain; the pain persisted even with zero movement whatsoever. Within the first 12 hours the pain spread to my entire left shoulder, and within 24 hours the pain spread to my neck, and general upper left quadrant of my body to the point where inhaling deeply would cause chest pain on my left side. This extreme pain persisted for about 3-4 days. After about the 5th day, my left arm still felt different and weaker than my right arm but little pain remained. After the 7th day, pain started back up whenever I tried to use my arm in any way. The days went on and the pain and arm weakness is not passing. It is minor pains, aches, and occasional throbbing compared to those first few days after vaccination but chronic pain nonetheless. My left arm continues to feel weak and I have a concentrated area of pain directly where the vaccination site was, it&#39;s as if I could still feel exactly where the needle went through my body. My arm feels okay pain-wise upon waking most days but I am unable to do anything as simple as chopping vegetables or washing dishes without feeling pain for the rest of the day. I am unable to even wear a backpack for more than 10 minutes without my left shoulder hurting and feeling fatigued.

                                                I got the vaccine some time in the night when i was taking a shower i noticed arm soreness. when i went to bed around 11pm from the top of my shoulder down to my finger tips it was swollen and had arm pain. I tried to go to bed and about 30 minutes later i went to get up to grab some advil. I checked in the mirror to see if there was redness and got light headed. Next thing i know i passed out. I woke up on the floor and a big pool of blood i dont know how long i was out for. I had a nose bleed and had a bruise on my head, I could leave the bath room because i was shaking so bad and couldnt use any force to get up. After 45 mins that i went to my room and called my mom who is a physican i sat on the floor for 3 or 4 hours until i could get the nose bleed to stop. I ended up then getting into bed and the shacking had stopped after 800 mg of advil. I checked my pupils for signs of cuncussion. the 1/25 i had my first appointment and we checked to see if i broke my nose. after that the next days they did see signs of concussion with sleeping 20 hours a day and blurry vision. I went back to  med center to get an mri and eeg to see about the concussion because they were worried since i didnt know how long i was out for. They also sent me to a concussion specialist. I had follow up care about the concussion for a month or so.  For about a week floowing the vaccine i was taking 800mg 3times a day for the tremor&#39;s and fever

I took a 200mg Advil at 8:45am.

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (reported as COVID 19 vaccine), intramuscular on 27Dec2020 12:00PM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left arm and it was the first dose. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included influenza vaccine (FLU) on 16Dec2020 at right arm. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced fever up to 120F, bodyaches, headache, dulled taste and smell, pain at the injection site on 27Dec2020. Patient didn&#39;t receive treatment for the adverse events. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of events was not recovered. The events were reported as non-serious.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event hyperpyrexia cannot be excluded based on compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

                                                Starting January 4th, 2021, I noticed that I was itching on my chest and found a rash localized to my medial chest. The rash didn&#39;t appear to grow from the area. Later, on January 9th, I began to itch more on my lower back of neck and upper back and had someone take a look. They noted I had a rash in the upper back as well. Taking another claritin, tylenol, and using hydrocortisone cream has not helped with the rash.

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/29 at approximately 12:30 pm. On 12/31 I woke up with itching in my scalp. On 1/1 the itching started spreading throughout my body. I have continuously been itching since 12/31. The itching is all over my scalp, arms, hands, back, and legs. I have recently developed a pain/pressure in the back of my head, that feels like I have smacked it against a wall. I have also recently developed pain in my chest. I have seen my PCP, dermatologist, and ED drs and no one can find a route cause for my reaction.

Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

Took 50mg Benadryl at bedtime along with Claritin. Woke up 1/25/21 with swelling of both lips and swelling in throat what felt like around tonsil and lymph area (have had tonsillectomy). Went to ER was given additional Benadryl  PO, IV Decadron and  IV Pepcid. Was discharged home with a prednisone taper prescription, Benadryl and Pepcid. My full biological sister also had minor hives after her second dose of Pfizer , but has never had an anaphylactic reaction in the past and her onset was within the first day after vaccination.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid, on 29Dec2020 at 18:40 (at the age of 25-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced broke out in hives all over her body on 03Jan2021, which was reported as medically significant. The patient also didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable and areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened on 03Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received her first dose of the vaccine on 29Dec2020 and said 5 days later she broke out in hives. The patient stated her hives began on the evening of 03Jan2021. She clarified she had hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable. She said she still had areas on her legs and ankles that were reddened. She said the reddened areas on her legs and ankles are not fully raised or itchy, like she had experienced with the hives on the rest of her body. The patient went to an urgent care on 06Jan2021. She saw a dermatologist for the hives on 07Jan2021, who suspected that since she did not have any prior history of hives, her hives are from the COVID-19 vaccine. She said the dermatologist told her there is no way to truly test if the vaccine caused her hives. The patient received an intramuscular unspecified steroid shot at the dermatologist and was prescribed methylprednisolone (MANUFACTURED BY: PAR PHARMACEUTICAL; Lot number: 1129091; Expiration date: Dec2021) 4 mg tablets in a taper dose pack. She also stated that she took the following over-the-counter medications: diphenhydramine hydrochloride (reported as: generic BENADRYL; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN; Lot number: 0MR0456; Expiration date: Sep2022) 25 mg tablet, taken as needed; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC; Lot number: 1652346; Expiration Date: Dec2021) 10 mg tablet, taken as one tablet up to four times a day; and hydrocortisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) cream. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all of the events as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of broke out in hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable was recovering and of areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

A week later on January 15 I started to itch from head to toe all over my body. On January 25 woke up with hives/rash that is on and off all over my body. I am still itchy and still occasionally have the rash. Have been to my pcp and a dermatologist and as of 1/9/21 they do not have a reason to how or why this happened.  Nothing in my daily life has changed soaps, detergent, food, drink, work gloves.

Symptoms began the evening after receiving second dose and have continued for over 5 days now. Itching, red bumps, and raised rash appear. Have shown up on arms, legs, chest, back, neck, ears in patches sometimes small, other times covers entire back. Appear for about an hours then resolves only to show up in a different area shortly after. Have had similar reactions in the past due to reaction to cosmetics/detergents but have not used any new products recently. Have also tried to moisturize to rule out dry skin and has not worked. Currently been treating by icing the area, hydrocortisone cream, and Benadryl.

My heart rate increased and it felt as though my blood pressure decreased rapidly. After 30 minutes my symptoms had worsened and I was so disoriented I was not able to seek medical attention while being observed. I exited the building and once I got into my car my face (specifically under my eyes and on my cheeks) began swelling and a red burning rash appeared. By the time I got home (10 more minutes) I needed Benadryl immediately, I was not able to complete my sentences and all other symptoms had become more intense. I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours for the next few days due to the symptoms consistently rebounding. I had one episode of throat tightness but it passed without use of my epipen. I checked my pulse and blood pressure frequently with the lowest reading being 93/60. Lethargy, shakiness, confusion, high heart rate all are still present after 5 days. The rash went away after 48 hours.

                                                Within 1 hour of injection (10:00am), began experiencing fatigue that got increasingly worse. By 2:00pm, had slurred speech; severe fatigue; red skin on hands, face, neck; balance problems and dizziness; swollen hands. That evening through the next morning, I was experienced severe flu-like symptoms, including vertigo, extremely severe fatigue, and full-body muscle aches. My temperature was slightly elevated (98.7) from my &#34;baseline,&#34; which is around 96.7. On Saturday, I was very tired, no appetite, still experiencing some vertigo and muscle aches. Symptoms improved overnight and by Sunday evening, I was mostly back to normal, with some lingering fatigue.

                                                About 30 seconds after the injection I felt a strange sharp pain right under where the injection site was. I was advised to sit near the nurses station for 30 minutes instead of 15 due to my medical history. One of the nurses came by to check on me and as we were chatting my entire left shoulder and up my neck suddenly got red and rashy. I looked down and both of my arms were rashy as well. I began to experience itching everywhere. The nurse gave me 50 mg of benedryl and monitored me for about 40 minutes. The rash went down and they had my husband come pick me up. I called my pcp and advised them or the situation. She asked to keep her informed and if anything got worse to administer the Epi-Pen and go to the ER. Once home I slept for about 5 1/2 hours and then woke up in the afternoon. I had a minor headache and my arm had started to swell, but the rash was completely gone. As of today my arm is still red and swollen under the injection site, and itches quite a lot.

                                                fatigue; Throat tightness; sore throat; Rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 25-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 06Mar2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6025) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies: Penicillin. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Concomitant medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), took the week prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced rash (Amoxicillin tablets. Had allergic reaction when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime).   The patient experienced sore throat, throat tightness and rash, all on 06Mar2021 14:30. Clinical course: After receiving COVID 19 Vaccine, within one to two minutes of vaccine very strong sore throat and tightening of the throat. Was taken to emergency room by the ambulance that was at the testing center. At that time the ambulance at testing center recommended taking two Benadryl&#39;s, which started to work and sore throat and tightness completely went away about 15 minutes after that and then started to come back at time of riding in ambulance to the ER. While being written up and vitals checked, the rash (blotchy) developed to which she was given a Solumedrol steroid shot to fix the rash which amazingly cleared up rash and it ended up back to white. Had amazing clear photos of rash and it being red and sloshes starting to appear. After caller left ER and went home and had couple of follow up prescriptions of Pepcid and Atarax to help combat rash for two days. Now she was taking Allegra still for adverse events. Reporter mentioned sore throat was on and off but it had improved and still had a little bit of a rash. Caller had a little bit of tightness and it had improved if she exerted herself a lot the tightness got worse she wsn&#39;t referring to a big exertion but provided example like if she is going to the grocery store. The rash was severely reduced but was apparent. Caller also mentioned she had pretty severe fatigue after receiving vaccine unsure if this was because of the vaccine or an allergic reaction to some medication in her. She missed work on Monday and part time on Tuesday due to having to take breaks and naps during the day. Caller went into work but she did not feel up to working a full day in the office and was working remotely from home right now. The patient had allergic reaction to amoxicillin tablets when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime. Caller stated she knew how important it is to report not sure if there is an association between Amoxicillin and COVID ingredients. May have another allergy that was contributing but Amoxicillin was only other known allergy. Caller was asking for the next steps since she still has not fully recovered her throat, she is still feeling sore and tighter than normal and her skin was still redder than normal. When she had the rash it was red blotchy and warm to the touch it was no longer warm to the touch. Outcome of the events sore throat, throat tightness and rash was recovering, of event fatigue was unknown.

I continued to have hives spread across my chest, both arms, stomach, and the back of my knees from the 18-22, I suddenly lost my voice on the 21st when I woke up in the morning. I went to a park view clinic in my town on the 22nd and received treatment for my hives. As of the 24th I am taking medications prescribed to me and my hives are slowly going away and my voice is coming back. I have also experienced nasal drainage and a cough from the 19 and onward.

It started in her scalp, moved to her face, and then onto her throat. She was at work at this time. I advised her to take a 25 mg Benadryl (which may cause drowsiness). Based on her size (145 lbs) employee did not recommend she take a 50 mg Benadryl. Patient did not know if she had a fever or not. She reported NO fever at that time. Employee called her back at 6:30 PM to check on her. She said she had to leave work around 2 pm; she was feeling bad, achey. She said she took some ibuprofen as she was feeling achey and feverish. she didn&#39;t feel the need to go to the doctor or urgent care at this time.

                                                Within 1 or 2 hours, I was getting hives on my arms and my neck. My throat was getting irritated and swollen a little bit. I did not do anything for the symptoms at that time.  I was just drinking water and waiting for those symptoms going away and they went away in about four- six hours.  Doctor check-up the following Monday for these symptoms but the hives were gone. I was nauseous for about four days. I was kind of tired. At injection site - it was kind of red and swollen but those went away after one day - that I got when I had the hives and irritated/swollen throat. I started having dizziness - a few hours after the vaccine and that lasted for about six days where I would get dizzy on and off throughout the day.  I had my second vaccine on February 6 2021. I was recovered from these adverse events before 2nd dose.

                                                About 10 minutes after the second dose, I noticed the hives and irritation come on my throat, neck and my arm. I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

                                                I felt itching right after taking the vaccine. I stayed for 30 min and it was not getting worse. The next day, when I waked up, my left arm is swelling and itching. Redness appears as an allergy symptom. The itching, swelling,  redness did not go off until today, which has been a week after the vaccine. The symptom is only limited to the left arm, near the injection site.

                                                My daughter experienced immediate nerve pain at the site, L deltoid; followed by radiation to her fingers.  Then, she complained of extreme muscle pains, all over; itching and shortness of breath with formation of mucus in her chest.  She has interstitial lung disease and is well aware of what mucus-filling in her chest (lungs) feels like.  She also had headache and coughing and this necessitated using Benadryl 50mg, her Xopenex rescue inhaler at the site; followed by contacting of her pulmonologist for future treatment and instructions.

                                                I received the vaccine in my left arm and noticed the pain in my left arm and armpit the day after receiving the shot. 2 days after receiving the shot, I noticed the swelling of my left lymph node in my left armpit. It was very painful to move my arm or leave my arm resting in a normal position since it would put pressure on my lymph node. I had very limited mobility on days 2,3 and 4 after the vaccine but quickly improved starting day 5 with very minimal pain. I had a video call with a doctor who recommended 800mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours &amp; warm compress on the lymph node. In general, I had very minimal symptoms from the first vaccine except the lymph node swelling &amp; pain. Starting day 5 post vaccine I was basically back to normal &amp; have felt good ever since.

                                                Swelling and redness of the arm within an hour after the vaccine. Tingling began in middle, ring, and pinky fingers within 20 minutes of injection. Numbness began within the first hour. Within two hours, I lost strength and 60% use of my left hand. The pinky and ring finger of my left hand have been either completely numb or tingling ever since my shot over one week ago.   I noticed mild numbness about 3-4 days after the first dose, but assumed I had just slept funny. When my arm became red and hand became tingly after my second dose, I realized this was an effect of the vaccine and not merely a pinched nerve in my sleep.

                                                I had the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 4/6 and felt dizzy 30 minutes later. The dizziness continued for the next 84 hours. On 4/9 (three days after vaccination), I fainted on my  driveway as I was heading home around noon time. I felt dizzy the whole afternoon but were trying to help out the groceries from the car. I fell down on the concrete driveway with two bags of groceries on my hand. I did not blackout, but were not able to get up for 10 seconds due to the dizziness. I eventually recovered from the dizziness 84 hours after the first dose of vaccine. I injured my knee as I fell, but the wound were treated at home immediately.  As for the sore arm, I could not hold any items heavier than 1 lb. The arm soreness went away after 48 hours with ice pack applied on upper arm(injection area).

                                                About an hour after her vaccine, patient called and said that she was nauseous, vomiting, had passed out twice, a rash from the injection site up to her throat, and her arm was swollen from the elbow up.  I told her to take Benadryl and to go to the ER or to the immediate care.  I followed up with her the next day and she went to the ER, she said the Benadryl helped her out significantly and that she was feeling much better that day.  She was still inquiring about the second shot but, she was following up with her MD on Wednesday.

After that initial phase, around 48 hours after the second shot on April 8th, developed extreme fatigue/exhaustion, aches, muscle pains, headache, nausea, chills, diarrhea, and skin burning/itching where I have existing scars. One week after 2nd vaccine (after 7 days of being sick) menstruation came early and experienced heavy, heavy bleeding. This is now day 2 of heavy bleeding and all other continued symptoms.

                                                Within 1 hour of receiving the vaccine, I had mild tongue swelling, shortness of breath, fingers swelling, intense sweating and faintness. Within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine, hives developed on my left thigh. The tongue swelling, shortness of breath and faintness happened on and off for the first day. It resolved on its own by the next day. The hives got progressively worse and peaked roughly 48 hours after getting the vaccine. They slowly faded, but are still faintly noticeable. I had general malaise  for the rest of the week. I have photos showing the progression of the hives.

Fever broke in the early am hours of 4/22/21, with the chills going away as fever was gone. The burning eye sensation and tiredness were no longer present upon waking am of 4/23/21.  Itchy skin and hives on feet around noon on 4/21/21. Hives on feet disappeared on their own by early pm of 4/22/21. Itchy and sensitive skin persists as of time of this report in early pm 4/23/21. Shallow breathing (normal and deep breaths were painful), wheezing, and feeling like I&#39;m breathing through a sponge and that there is concrete (serving as weight) in my chest every time I inhaled began early am 4/21/20. I began producing mucus from deep coughs as of late pm 4/22/21 and that also continues to the time of this report, accompanied by wheezing and slightly deeper (but still shallower than normal) breathing.

After noticing some blood coming from the injection site patient became very worried and said she felt lightheaded. She was offered a chair to sit on but within 5 minutes of sitting down she said she was not feeling any better. While I was talking to her she seemed to have a mild seizure-like episode which lasted less than a minute. After she became alert she said her thumbs were cramping up and asked us to call 911 for her. Paramedics took her to the hospital.

Had to see dermatologist to get put on a steroid to get rid of the rash after a skin biopsy determined it was spongiotic dermatitis (he suspects a medication).

I&#39;m now using a body lotion daily so I have not experienced much itchiness since. I&#39;ve been very fatigued &amp; irritable. My headaches have gotten worse and I haven&#39;t had much of an appetite.

                                                I noticed a scaly, dry spot on the back of my thigh sometime between 4/6/21 and 4/9/21. I didn&#39;t think much of it until roughly 4/21/21, when the rash spread across my body. It is primarily on my torso (front and back) but also on legs, arms, and face. The rash was originally red and scaly, and is beginning to fade so it has less texture. Most spots are about nickel sized, but some are closer to an egg. It is not itchy or painful, just very dry and red. I had my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday which is what prompted me to realize it was probably a side effect of the shot - because it did not come on until about 2 weeks later, I didn&#39;t originally put the two together. I will be watching to see if it worsens in another week or two now that I&#39;ve had the second dose. I have scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor to be safe.

She went to the emergency department at Medical Center  and was diagnosed with ITP by a hematologist who recommended that she not receive the second covid vaccine given the risks outweigh the benefits with her new diagnosis/possible reaction to the vaccine.  She was treated with IVIG and prescribed corticosteroids and discharged.  Two weeks later she was visiting friends in another city and developed a severe headache.  She presented to our facility and was found to have a subdural hematoma on imaging and a platelet count of 9k cells/mm3.  She was aggressively treated for her ITP with high dose IVIG, romiplostim, and rituximab and has stabilized neurologically with the SDH stable - though her platelets have been treatment refractory despite transfusions and the aforementioned therapy.  Remains admitted at our facility.

                                                I started to experience full body itches about 3-4 days after getting the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine. It would not be constant, but randomly throughout the day I would experience itching all over, mostly on firearms, back and legs, but nearly every part of my body would experience it at some point. This last for about 4 days the first time and seemed to disappear. After receiving my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the itching returned about the same timeframe after, about 3-4 days, but has not stopped yet. It has been about 3 weeks and I still experience the full body (debilitating at times) itches every day. I seem to experience mostly at night, although it does creep up during the day occasionally. I have not seen a doctor yet as I haven&#39;t felt the need to, but if it does continue, I might need to  because it it very distracting and uncomfortable at times. The itching is sometimes accompanied by very small, almost unnoticeable white bumps, but not always. I have mostly noticed these bumps on my forearms where there is less body hair.  On days where it is really bad, lotion sometimes soothes it temporarily.
