Patient stated that she was feeling &#34;off&#34; and we helped lower her to the ground into a sitting position. She stated that she felt dizzy and we lowered her onto her back and raised her legs onto a chair. 911 was contacted. Patient remained responsive and was able to answer questions throughout. Patient stated that her shoulder felt like it was burning where she received the injection. She also stated that her face felt numb and her lips felt funny (tingling).  Patient was still able to breathe and respond appropriately to all questions. Care was taken over by Ambulance service. After speaking with patients mother later in the day, it was determined patient had a vasovagal episode.

                                                The teen had a history of autoimmune disorder, alopecia areata for the past 2 years. When received the first dose of pfizer COVID vaccine, she started losing hair rapidly after about 6 to 7 days.  She was started on large dose of prednisone 100mg per day after 2 weeks to slow down alopecia. However, in the span of 4 days she lost most of her hair.  We are wondering if the vaccine could have exacerbated the autoimmune disorder.

                                                My daughter had her vaccine at 6:15 on 4/7/21. She complained of a horrible soreness in the site of the shot, headache, and fatigue. Those were her only symptoms. I gave her ibuprofen. She stayed home from school and rested. I checked on her, and she said her headache was getting better. She had a seizure at work around 4:15 pm on 4/8/21. Her co-workers called 911, and the ambulance took her to the Medical Center. They did a head CT and ran labs. They were unsure if she had passed out or had a seizure. They gave her ibuprofen for the headache and told us to follow up with our PCP and monitor her for the weekend. She had another seizure on 4/8/21 at 10:30 pm. We called 911, and they took her to the Medical center again. They gave her Keppra and called a hospital to see if they wanted her transferred. The hospital said to provide her with the Keppra, follow up with them on Monday the 4/12/21, plus sent us home with a prescription for Keppra. They sent us home at 2:00 am on 4/9/21. I gave her the Keppra at 10:30 am on 4/9/21. She had another three seizures back to back. The EMT had to provide her with something to stop the seizures because I could tell she was about to have another one. They took her to the hospital, where she continued to have several episodes in the ER. They admitted her and gave her a higher dose of Keppra. They hooked her up to an EEG and determined that the seizure, not epileptic seizures, was brought on by stress. They released her from the hospital on 4/11/21. They told us that we needed to reduce her stress and follow-up with Neurology on 4/12/21. We could give her ibuprofen and Benedryl for the pain. She has several seizures a day, and is having numbness on her left side which they knew before releasing her. Her headache has never gone away. I keep telling them she has a horrible headache and the more seizures she is having the worse they get throughout the day. On 4/11/21, she had 17 episodes total and Monday, 4/12/21,  21 episodes. On 4/13/21, we took her back to the ER but this time took her to a different hospital. They were not able to treat because they wanted her to be seen by a pediatric neurologist. The hospital transferred her to another hospital. Where she was admitted on 4/13/21 and once again ran labs and hooked her up to an EEG. They told us they are not epileptic events and don&#39;t worry. They treated her for a chronic migraine. Sent her home telling us to give 3 ibuprophen, 2 Benedryl, and 1 Reglan every six hours until the headache is gone. She still has a severe headache and having seizures.

                                                Patient reported feeling lightheaded status post first dose Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot: EW0167, expiration date: 08/31/2021) to medic. Medic noted that the client was CAOx4,  her skin was pale, warm and slightly moist, pupils were equal, round, reactive to light and accommodating (PEARRL), respiration rate (RR) was 20. The client&#39;s sister stated the client had a history of anxiety and that &#34;she gets this way whenever she gets a shot&#34;. Medic walked patient to the zero gravity chair. The client was given water to sip on. At 1213 baseline vitals were taken with client sitting: Blood pressure (BP): 110/82, heartrate (HR): 98, RR: 20, PEARRL. Medic  reports she coached the client on her breathing  to help alleviate her complaint of feeling lightheaded, mild nausea and anxiety. Client reported she felt anxious prior to her vaccination and that her last oral intake was 15 minutes prior to vaccine. Client denied headache, blurry vision and chest pain. At 1220 a second set of vitals were taken while standing: BP 108/80, HR 86, RR 16, CAOx4. Client stated her symptoms were diminishing. Client&#39;s RR slowed down to normal rate and rhythm, vital signs were trending to normal and client was negative for orthostatic pressures. Client was advised to stay for additional 30 minute observation. Client&#39;s symptoms resolved completely and she was able to ambulate away from observation site without assistance and with a steady gait.

                                                Approximately 3 minutes after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccination in her left deltoid developed a flat, non-priuritic, erythemic rash along both anterior arms. She denied any airway involvement; on examination her mouth was without edema or erythema. She was breathing comfortably and in no acute distress. She was provided with 50 mg of diphenhydramine at 11:28. She was rechecked 15 minutes and 30 minutes later, during which time her rash faded but did not resolve.  She was advised that the CDC&#39;s recommendations when an immediate reaction occurs is to not get her second dose, but that she can consider seeing an immunologist/allergist to discuss this more in depth. We discussed that should symptoms worsen, particularly if she develops airway symptoms, she should present to the ER for evaluation. She left the clinic at 12:04 pm accompanied by family in no apparent distress with no further concerns.

                                                Eleven days later, she got another allergic reaction with blister on her arm, water filled blister; She got blister on the opposite arm of the injection, on her right arm; Diagnosed her with a skin disease that happens when your immune system is under attack; Her arm is now swollen around the blister; bullous pemphigoid; cellulitis; Had an allergic reaction; Itchiness; They gave her a high dose/received a higher dose of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 17-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Apr2021 at 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ew0153) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma seasonal only during allergy season. No episodes this year. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  Concomitant medications included Multivitamin/women&#39;s one a day gummies. The parent reported that her daughter had the vaccine done on 10Apr2021 and she had an allergic reaction that evening, she had itchiness. So, I contacted the pharmacist that she had an allergic reaction and she told me that they gave her a high dose and there were few patients who got the high dose. So, eleven days later, she got another allergic reaction with blister on her arm, water filled blister, I took her to an urgent care and they referred me to a dermatologist that diagnosed her with a skin disease that happens when your immune system is under attack (event captured as per verbatim). So, I went to her primary doctor and her primary doctor has put her on antibiotic because her arm is now swollen around the blister, so now, she is on ointment, antibiotic and vitamin d (treatment) to bring up her immune system and also she has to get her blood work done to check her immune system. She also stated that the reaction my daughter is now having and how her primary doctor is suggesting not to take her second dose because she highly thinks it is an allergic reaction to the vaccine.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.         Reported Event: Four hours after the injection on 10Apr2021 (Name) entire body began to itch and the top of mouth. The pharmacist was notified and at the time and further explained that (Name) was one of the patients that day who received a higher dose of the vaccine at the time of injection. The pharmacist did not notify me of how high the dosage was. So I cannot put the exact details on this report because I was not given that information by the pharmacist. I suggest the pharmacist be contacted for the exact mistaken dosage. The second side effect was on 21Apr2021 (Name) woke up with a water filled blister on her right arm which ruptured with a yellow liquid. We seeked medical attention on 21Apr2021 and 23Apr2021 from 3 different facilities. The outcome was (Name) being diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid and cellulitis. (Name) was placed on cephalexin 500mg, vitamin d 50mcg/2000 units, mupirocin 2%, and fluconazole 150 mg to build her immune system back up.

                                                she was not good with needles, so it was certainly good that it went quicker and less painful than she expected; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for herself. An 18-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EL1283, expiration date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a school or student health clinic. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. She did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. The patient was just nervous for a good amount of the time. When she got the vaccine she was overthinking and her left hand began to throb. She was not in pain but just a sinking feeling. She stated that she was not good with needles, so it was certainly good that it went quicker and less painful than she expected. She added that her nurse treated her so well and was so patient with her and she appreciated it so much. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19: Nasal Swab with result of negative on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event. Outcome of the event was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                bleeding; less soreness at the injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 18-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration administrated on left arm on 05Apr2021 at 16:00 at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other medications in two weeks. The patient did not have any known allergies. She received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, Lot number: EN6204, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administrated on left arm on 14Mar2021 at 15:00 (03:00 PM) at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 05Apr2021 04:00 PM, reported that the 2nd dose of vaccine caused unusual amount of bleeding after needle was removed. The patient had to clean excess blood after the shot. The band aid was soaked with blood. The patient experienced less soreness at the injection site compared to the first vaccine shot. The concern is whether the vaccine was bled out due improper injection. She did not have any other vaccine in four weeks before the covid-19 vaccine dose. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. She was not having COVID prior to the vaccination, neither was tested for Covid-19 post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in 2021.

A 19-year-old female nurse reported for herself that received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number Unknown), on 07Jan2021 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had not any medical history and did not receive any concomitant drugs.  The nurse reported that she had got this shot in her left arm and it is not too swollen but it has been swollen for about 4 days and there is still pain and redness in the site as well. It feels a little hard but it&#39;s just blood in that area. The nurse took a Tylenol (LOT# EK9231) or 2, but it didn&#39;t really do much. At the time of reporting the patient had not recovered.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Later in the day around 3:00pm I got chills and muscle soreness throughout my whole body. I then started to develop pain in my chest while breathing and I was having to gasp for air(this was around 5:30pm). My skin (mostly on my back) felt like it was burning and itchy. That lasted the entire night.  24 hours after the injection and I am still feeling tightness in my chest when I breathe, sore throat, and sore muscles.

Injection site soreness began immediately after the vaccine, but is normal for me. Everything else began at time listed on this form (1/25/2021 afternoon) and ended by the following morning. I took one Tylenol to help with the chills and pain about 5 hours after symptoms started and it seemed to help a little.

The person observing her noticed she seemed  zoned out and asked how she was doing at about 2:17 and learned that her tingliness was  turning into numbness of  extremities focused on her upper body.  She started displaying other symptoms of a minor panic attack.  We monitored her for the full 30 minutes, had her walk around, drink water, etc. She claimed that while her numbness wasn&#39;t getting better, it also wasn&#39;t getting worse. It was starting to itch though, so she was given some benedryl.  She then went home for the evening where her roommate could monitor her.   Next day, she called in to confirm that her numbness/itchiness had turned into a rash on her chest which has disappeared. But now is experiencing diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness.  She was informed that these symptoms were within the normal range of immune responses, but that if she was too miserable, she could go in to urgent care for medical assistance. She declined to do so at that time (approximately 11:45 am).

                                                About an hour (5:30pm est) after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on my left arm (taken Saturday, March 6th at around 4:30pm est) I started feeling itchy all over my body (neck, stomach, sides, thighs) and it looked like a rash (very red) showing me signs of an allergic reaction. The same thing happened throughout the day on Sunday (March 7th) and the rash would get better and then worsen so it was very on and off throughout my entire body. On Sunday evening after I took 2 Benadryls the rash got worse on my right arm and a small area of my left arm (bubbly-like features appeared). I went to sleep after taking the Benadryl and when I woke up the next morning it was completely gone. Then on Monday (March 8th) I was fine all day no signs of rashes or itching and then around 5pm I felt a burning sensation on my face and when I looked in the mirror both of my cheeks and a small part of my forehead were extremely red. I then took 2 Benadryls again and went to bed. Today (March 9th) I do not have signs of a rash and have not felt itchy all day.

The &#39;blister&#39; is on my right hand index finger (measured 9 mm by 7 mm at its widest points, has not changed size or character since appearing) with a fainter in color &#39;blister&#39; (5 mm by 3 mm at widest) present on my right hand pinkie. No &#39;trauma&#39; to the site. Nonblanching, two petechiae present within the ring finger&#39;s blister, two also present in the one on my pinky. Those petechiae have disappeared in the last two days, but the spots are still present. Red, not warm, sensitive to touch. I had no other symptoms from dose one of the vaccination, outside of a sore arm and some joint pain. Possibly fatigue, but that&#39;s likely just me being fatigued as per usual.

                                                Pt received Pfizer-COVID vaccine (under EUA) yesterday 16 Dec 2020 at approx 1700.  She did not have any immediate problems after vaccination.  .  She woke up today feeling achy and feverish, and measured her oral temp at 1000 as 101.4 at home.  She drank fluids, but took no meds -- repeat oral temp at 1200 was 99.0.  .  Other sxms include sore arm at vaccination site with min redness but no swelling.   .  She additionally reports nasal congestion and sore throat that began 1 day prior to vaccination, that she attributed to her seasonal allergies.  No meds for allergies.  No cough or SOB.  No headache or neuro sxms.  No GI sxms.  .  She was concerned about fever and went to drive-thru COVID testing at approx 1300... results due back in 24h.  She has no known COVID contacts.  .  She works in sterile processing at NMCSD with no direct patient contact usually; She is on night shift now.  -  Fever and achy symptoms, as above, in previously healthy hospital worker, with onset approx 18h after receipt of COVID-Pfizer vaccine, dose #1.  With questionable URI-like sxms one day prior to vaccination, COVID testing was very reasonable -- and results are pending now.  If COVID test negative, this most likely represents mild-moderate systemic reaction to vaccine.  Advised no work this evening, rest at home, increase clear fluids, and take Motrin 400mg q4-6h as needed for subjective fever or achiness -- use/precautions reviewed.  Will follow-up tomorrow with this team by phone.  If vaccine reaction, expect sxms to lessen rapidly and resolve over next 1-2 days.  Indications for urgent care -- including marked worsening of sxms or new sxms -- reviewed.  She also has number for 24/7 Immunization Support.  Will file VAERS, since work missed for sxms.  Will encourage enrollment in VSAFE as well.  Advised that, if mild-moderate systemic reaction determined most likely source of sxms, dose #2 of COVID-Pfizer vaccine will still generally be recommended.  Pt expresses understanding and appreciation of all issues.

                                                After receiving the second dosage of my COVID vaccine at 2 PM on 02/03/21, I only had left arm pain near the site of the injection. However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                I had a bumpy texture to the skin of my vaccination site one day after my vaccine. These hives spread to my chest going wide and above the clavicle to the sternum. I took Benadryl on the 12th and on the 13th and no reduction in the hives occurred. They are small skin-tone bumps that are not itchy or irritating. The bumps feel similar to sandpaper in texture. It has been one week past my vaccination and they have not decreased.

The rash also had a small patch on my left collar. The rash is itchy, small, red, raised bumps, like eczema. It&#39;s now Wednesday and the rash is spreading to other parts of my body: chin, on thigh near groin, thigh near knee, further down left arm, and tonight, my stomach. The rash is spreading in small circular patches and has progressed since Monday.

Around 2:00 on 3/11/2021, patient felt a chill, her temperature was 100.4 F orally. Temperature further increased to 103 F around 13:00 on 3/12/2021.   What happened as a result of the adverse event? (doctor visit, ED or urgent care visit, hospitalization, life threatening illness, disability/permanent damage, death, none of these): none of these, took OTC apap last night and this morning and just took ibuprofen after the 103 F reading.  Spoke with patient&#39;s mother, who stated that the is feeling fine. The patient&#39;s temperature is currently 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and initially came back to normal at 02:00 today (3/13/21). The patient experienced elevated temperatures before that time (02:00), of note was at 22:00 on 3/12/21, at which time the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. A later temperature after 22:00 on 3/12/21, and before 02:00 on 3/13/21, was recorded, which was 101 degrees Fahrenheit.   The patient&#39;s mother stated that the daughter may have COVID based upon speaking with her doctor, so she inquired if her daughter should be tested for the presence of antibodies against COVID-19. Patient&#39;s mother also inquired if there was a need for the second shot if it was seen that her daughter had antibodies against the virus.  Advised the mother that her questions would be looked into for answers, and that she would be called back with those answers.

Developed slight cough at 9:00pm. I took Benadryl to help sleep through the night in case of any other side effects. Cough went away overnight, but my arm remained sore. I took Tylenol again on 3/26/2021 at 6:30am. At 7:00pm the same day, my left armpit began to feel sore which could not have been caused by anything other than vaccine as I haven?t been doing any physical activity. This worsened the next day, but I have not taken any Tylenol to alleviate it at this point.

                                                About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed some itchy rash behind my right knee. Soon the rash started spreading all over my body. Legs, arms, chest and back.  The next day I saw the nurse at the vaccine station at my work where I received the vaccine and she looked at my rashes and suggested cold showers, Benadryl and a hydrocortisone cream. I have been applying it but I still have rashes and some have been drying out and scabbing. It is very itchy and the rashes are not pleasant to look at. I intend to see my PCP to see if something else can be done about the rashes. I was reading about the ingredients and I believe it is a polyethylene glycol that the vaccine has and penicillin has too that probably caused the rashes.

                                                About 12 hours after the vaccination I started developing a rash. I noticed it at first behind my right knee and as the hours passed it started all over my body, arms, legs, chest, back. It was very itchy. The next day it did not get any better and I went see the nurse at the vaccine clinic at my work where I received the shot at. she looked at the area on my back and arms and legs and suggested Benadryl and OTC hydrocortisone cream.  I have been using it but I still have some rash, some areas it is already drying out and scabbing and I believe it is because one of the ingredients of the vaccine is a polyethylene glycol that is also encountered in penicillin and I get bad rashes if administered penicillin.  Nothing life threatening but the itching is very aggravating and the rashes not pleasant to look at.

                                                I developed some small areas of rashes all over my body I had a rather large patch behind my right knee and lots of small rashes everywhere concentrated on my arms and lower back. They were all over. I am allergic to penicillin, I don&#39;t know and the rash that I got it looked like the one that I get from when I get penicillin. I looked up the ingredients and it seems they have a polyethoglycol like penicillin. I consulted with the nurse at the vaccine station and she suggested cold showers,  not get overheated it is not life threatening but it is still going on and some have started scabbing over but they are still here and they are itchy. The nurse also recommended OTC hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl but it has not really effective. I am thinking about going to see my PCP to se of something else can be done about it.

I started having hives and rashes all over for a total of 6 days . Itching, swelling on my ears, arm, wrist, hands, back etc... took Benadryl for the 6 days and it helped for the 1st 2 days of my adverse event after that the Benadryl did nothing. Me and my PCP has agreed it was a possible delayed allergic reaction to the vaccine.

                                                About one week after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, I developed a rash on two fingers of my left hand that itches. I used OTC hydrocortisone cream on it, which relieved the symptoms temporarily. Rash is still present today. I received the second dose of the vaccine yesterday, 1/9/2021, in my right arm, and today I noticed the rash is spreading to my right hand. I have not had any previous adverse reactions to any other vaccine. I went to urgent care today and the nurse practitioner recommended me to take Benadryl 25 mg at night to relieve symptoms.

                                                A day after the vaccine I got red hives all over my thighs that eventually went away 2 days later. The day after this subsided I started to get extremely itchy rashes on my neck that would come and go.  This has continued to occur. Exactly one week after the vaccine was given my lips began to swell up and become numb, again this went away with time.

Because of the chills the pain in my arm from the injection kept getting worse and worse, today(two days later) the pain is still present. The biggest thing is during my chills in the middle of the night i ran to the bathroom and vomited until there was nothing left to come up. The nausea continued for about 12 hours.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261) at right arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Historical Vaccine included unspecified flu vaccine taken in Oct2020 for immunisation. The patient experienced bleeding after shot and bruise on 21Jan2021. The patient said she got her first dose last night and after the pharmacist finished and pulled the needle out there was quite a lot of blood after she pulled the needle out, and there was a bruise there. She didn&#39;t know if a blood vessel got nicked when all that happened. She would like to know if the dose was efficacious or if it is possible some of the vaccine came out with the blood. The patient said that the bleeding from the injection stopped probably within just a minute after she gave it or less, and there was no treatment given. The outcome of event bleeding after shot was recovered; of event bruise was unknown.

Eyes felt swollen a few hours after receiving vaccine between 1-2 pm. Symptoms went away. At around 11pm I got welts and hives all over my body but they were particularly prevalent at the vaccine site. No change in routine throughout the day nor a change in food. Largely went away by the next day around 1pm. Still experiencing slight itchiness.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 17:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Nurse stated her daughter received her first Pfizer vaccine on 06Jan2021 around 5:30 pm. The patient&#39;s signs and symptoms began shortly after receiving the shot. That evening at 19:00, she had very itchy eyes, the next morning (07Jan2021) she woke up with swollen eyes, a rash on her forehead, around her eyes and both cheeks. She took benedryl and zyrtec on 07Jan2021. The symptoms clear up by 10Jan2021, following a visit to her HCP, on 08Jan2021. She received a steroid shot, a prednisone dose pack her HCP. Her HCP recommended she not take dose 2 and instructed her mother to call Pfizer for recommendations. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021.  The  reporting nurse considered the case as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events of swollen eyes, itching eyes and rash on face were likely related to first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), due to plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Developed a whole body rash 6 days after my first Pfizer vaccine. The rash was very large and covered about 80% of my body. The rash consisted of redness, small bruise spots and extreme itching. I self treated myself by taking several cool showers and took acetaminophen two times two capsules. On the second day, blotches are subsiding but I have fatigue and weariness in limbs. Skin is less red but has a sallow color and blotchy which is unusual.

                                                I started with a red rash over both arms centered around the elbows-more intense on my shot arm about four days after vaccination .  Then on the fifth day I took a shower and experienced burning on my skin when I got out my entire arms were red and splotchy. I applied lotion and took allergy medicine because it was also itchy. Further on my skin became abrasive in that area and then it started to spread every where on my body-legs, stomach, under my chin, arms, butt, and chest. Then my body started to peel excessively-almost as if I was sunburnt-I could rub my legs and tons of flakes came off. I used copious amounts of oil, lotion, and still continue to take an allergy pill and it has been a full week since it first started, and it is not getting better.-in fact it keeps spreading. I have not changed any products or switched medicine or been exposed to any other environment during this time.

                                                From the beginning, I had extremely enlarged lymph nodes and felt fatigued. Every day my lymph nodes grew until they were the size of golf balls. On Tuesday morning at 2:30 AM, I began to have a fever and developed a mild full body rash. This severely escalated and by Wednesday, I developed full body hives and uncontrollable fevers as high as 105. Since then, I have been anti-histamines and steroids, which made my rash worse but helped the fever and lymph nodes. My hives are painful, itchy, and getting worse.

In the following 10 to 15 minutes my lips started tingling and my throat started to tighten up. The itching finally stopped after 10 minutes. The tingling in my lips and throat tightening occurred with both the first and second dose. The staff kept me for around 45-50 minutes for both doses of the vaccine.  When going home I took 2 Benadryl.

Was with her mom, in case she had an issue. Vaccination without incident.  Kept pt at the vaccination area to observe.  About three minutes after receiving the vaccination, pt started to shake.  Was conversing.  Stated she was warm, so got her a cold bottle of water.  Stated she was dizzy so helped her to the floor to lay down.  She had contractions of her hands, which she stated that they were numb.  She recovered from the dizziness, but then had a panic attack.  Her BP was normal, but her heart rate became elevated.  Had her lay down until she felt better, helping to slow her breathing.  After about 40 minutes,p t felt good enough to sit in the recovery area.  Ensured she had water and some food to help prevent a blood sugar drop.

                                                About five to ten minutes after I received my first shot, I started to feel like my throat was closing a little. I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 17Apr2021 at 09:10 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included penicillin allergy from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing, asthma from an unspecified date (diagnosed at 4 years old and it is usually controlled with medications) and ongoing and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome from 2019 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccination and did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient previously received the flu shot on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced allergic to flu shot preservative and the patient previously received Biaxin on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication and experienced allergy. On 17Apr2021 at 09:12 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock; on 17Apr2021 the patient experienced throat feels tight, ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that comes and goes and then it will be on her chest , face, neck and shoulders and migrates wherever; on 18Apr2021 the patient experienced ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat; on 20Apr2021 the patient experienced dark purple on face; on 24Apr2021 the patient experienced some trouble breathing and chest pain; on 25Apr2021 the patient experienced a lot of bone pain; on 26Apr2021 the patient experienced white blood cell counts are all elevated and on unspecified dates the patient experienced face and neck swells, tachycardia, feels like she is having an asthma attack, blotch, blood counts continue to become worse and asthma worse. The reporter called to report that her daughter received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 17Apr2021 and that her side effects started two minutes later (also reported as 4 minutes later). The patient experienced anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. She stated that her daughter continued to have anaphylactic reactions and had to go to the hospital every day since then. The clinical course was reported as follows: her daughter and her husband went to get the vaccine together on 17Apr2021. They went to a facility giving the Pfizer vaccine, and the reporter stated that her daughter was asked, and she did tell them, that she could not receive the flu vaccine that had the additives in it because she was allergic to it. The reporter stated that her daughter was not taking the flu shot for years. She stated that her daughter was allergic to Biaxin but could take Zithromax because of the different additives. They had no idea what the preservative was, but it was obviously in the flu shot so they stopped getting the flu shot until they stopped putting the preservative in the vaccine. The reporter stated that her daughter received the COVID-19 vaccine and within two minutes her daughter told her dad that she was having a hard time breathing. Her daughter walked over to the city EMS who were on site and told them that she was having a hard time breathing. They treated her and then took her to hospital via ambulance. She was treated at the hospital and they were hesitant to discharge her because they were worried about her bounce back. This was exactly what has happened. Every night since the vaccine she has had to take her daughter into the hospital. Every day was a nightmare of either EpiPen injections, Tagamet, Benadryl or prednisone and ended up in the ER every day, where they give her IV Benadryl and send her home. The caller stated that her daughter&#39;s symptoms start with ginormous welts and then an itching to the back of the throat. She had seen a ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that came and went and then it would be on her chest, face, neck and shoulders and migrated wherever. She saw dark purple on her daughter&#39;s face yesterday before she went to the ER. Her skin will blotch, and she will say that her throat feels tight like when she had a reaction to penicillin. She stated that her daughter used to get this when she they would give her penicillin; she would have that reaction every time she got penicillin and they finally said she was allergic to it. The caller states that after those symptoms started, she called EMS and they took her to a hospital. The caller stated she took her daughter to another hospital and they medicated her with IV Benadryl and fluids. Her primary care doctor told the emergency room staff to discharge the patient and that he would give her specific medications to go home with. He called in the medications, but they did not work. He gave her specific medication that did not work, half of her face was turning purple. The purple face was then replaced by an area approximately 1 inch wide on cheek between temple and the jaw. It was 1.5 inches long and was red and looked like a rash or welt. The patient would take an inhaler when she started to have breathing difficulties. That was when the reporter was like &#34;here she goes again&#34;. It felt like it almost made her asthma worse and had to treat that as well. There was a little oddity when they did blood work on her daughter and her white blood count was high and was probably her body reacting to the COVID-19 vaccine. So, she went back to the hospital. The nurses said there was nothing they could do for her, and she needed to find an allergist. The reporter stated that she was tired of the ER visits and wanted her daughter to get better. She stated that she doubled the dose of her daughter&#39;s Tagamet. She stated that the patient&#39;s face and neck swells and she would get tachycardia. The reporter stated that she would not take her daughter to the hospital anymore. The hospital did not think it could be related to the vaccine, but she had not done anything else. The reporter wanted to report this event because she did not think people were taking this seriously. She stated that no one believed it was related to the vaccine, so they were not getting help. She wanted to know if this was a side effect and what could she do about it. She also inquired on whether her daughter should get the second shot. She stated that her daughter would not get the second shot. She had heard that if you had any reaction to the vaccine, then you should not receive the second dose. Her daughter&#39;s doctors have told her to receive the second vaccine. The reporter also stated that she wondered if this was some mast cell activation due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The reporter also asked if Pizer made a preservative free vaccine. Upon follow-up received on 27Apr2021, the patient called to report that she was still experiencing side effects from the anaphylactic reaction and it had been 10 days since administration. She was told it would last about 4-10 days and then be gone, but it had continued, and it had been over 10 days. She had no new symptoms, other than a lot of bone pain. The bone pain made it feel like her bones were shattering. She went to the ER yesterday where they did blood work and said that all of her white blood cell counts were elevated. The anaphylaxis lasted from 17Apr2021 and subsided in that sense on 24Apr2021.  Since then she still had the chest pain, some trouble breathing, and felt like she was having an asthma attack. She had been back and forth to the ER several times since 17Apr2021. The ER kept ruling her symptoms as a reaction to the vaccine. She had been using epinephrine as needed. The patient stated that she was not planning on receiving the second dose due to her reaction. She wanted to know where she should go from here. She wanted to know if this would last forever and how much longer could her symptoms last. The clinical outcomes of the events ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat and a lot of bone pain were not recovered/not resolved; dark purple on face was recovered/resolved on 21Apr2021; outcomes of all other events were unknown.

This nurse reported similar events for 3 patients. This is the first of 3 reports.  A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away. She reported that this one is medically significant because even though she did not have shortness of breath, it could have affected her airway. She confirmed that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;had a tightness and lump in her throat&#39;, allergic reaction was not recovered (a s reported); while recovered on 27Dec2020 for allergic reaction like rash/red rash on her chest and rash was on her arms too and cheeks were flushed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events throat tightness, sensation of foreign body, allergy to vaccine, rash erythematous and flushing cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Rash consisting of hives or small red bumps suddenly appeared on upper body (arms, chest, upper back) the morning of 12/26/20. Rash continued to spread to lower back and stomach over the next few days with the left arm being the most affected area. Facial redness and swelling occurred however breathing was never affected.  Benadryl did not provide much relief. Visited an urgent care which classified it as an allergic reaction and started 5 day course of prednisone on 12/28/2020. Symptoms resolved upon completion of the prednisone. Total duration of symptoms was approximately one week. I had not used any new skin products or eaten any foods new to my diet and nothing else comes to mind as a potential contributing factor.

The region was about the size of an egg. It was mildly itchy, and painful to the touch. It was also warm to the touch. Swelling went down over time, fully reduced about 24 hours after it was noticed.  Area remained red for another 24 hours and was slightly warm and then it transitioned to looking more like a bruise.

The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well. The patient was taken to the emergency department for ongoing observation. The patient was released from emergency department after observation. The clinical outcome of flushed, hives, tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;, and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events flushing, urticaria, tong disorder, sensation of foreign body are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

                                                Vaccines received in series on 12/11/20 and 1/11/21. Three days before due date for second COVID vaccine, started severely itching and experiencing hive-like rash all over body, especially to hands and head; mostly relieved by benadryl but wore off every 6 hours. Contacted PCP (listed in form) who suggested taking zyrtec and using a moisturizing lotion. This helped for the day of receiving the vaccine. Thinking it was something unrelated due to the time elapsed from the vaccine, despite no changes in consumption or products/environment encountered, I went ahead and got the second vaccine. Day 1 after vaccine, I experienced the usually reported side effects, including slightly elevated temp, chills, and body aches. Itching and hives continued but not as noticeable due to other side effects. The next morning, hives and itching were significantly worse; any time I scratched (or something touched my skin more than lightly), large, red welps would nearly immediately develop, and often had raised bumps within the irritations. To date, this is continued, slightly relieved by allergy medications, but not entirely and must be taken around the clock or severe symptoms will begin again.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after the vaccination the patient reported dizziness and possible rash on her upper chest. It was difficult to assess if the rash was truly a rash or it was simply skin lesions that were already present (patient claimed she did not know). It did not resemble a maculopapular rash. It marginally resembled minor hives/urticaria. Patient did not report any localized symptoms at injection site. Patient was informed to remain seated and that her vitals would be taken and she would be further observed. Then about 10 minutes after this (25 minutes after vaccination), patient reported difficulty breathing. Facial redness was noted at this point and patient&#39;s breathing sounded difficult. Emergency medical services were called and EpiPen was administered at this point. Patient began to tremble and pace of breathing increased. Emergency medical technicians arrived, took vitals / EKG, and assessed the patient. EMT assessment did not reveal urticaria. EMT instructed patient to control her breathing. The EMTs believe that it may not have been a true reaction but rather the patient may have been suffering from an anxiety attack. Patient was then taken to local ER for further evaluation.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                On 1/20, I got a headache, dizziness, and my arm was extremely sore. Within about an hour, I became extremely nauseous and had both chills and sweats. I took my temperature at 6:00 pm on 1/20 and it read 99.7. I then took tylenol and at 8:30, I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. My normal temperature is 97.2-97.5. I took an ice bath at this point as my arm at the injection site was extremely swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. I called urgent care to see what medications I could take in addition to tylenol and they recommended motrin to bring down my fever. I woke up several times through the night and took medication. At around 8 am on 1/21, I took my temperature and it was 97.8.

                                                First 2 days after vaccination, I had some injection site pain that was improving. Day 5 after vaccination, I developed lymphadenopathy on my left side with swelling into the chest area developing on day 6. Day 8 after vaccination, my injection site turned red and itchy and I began to have trouble breathing. I went to urgent care.  I saw P. A. She said that it was more likely that the difficulty breathing would be due to my asthma, but she could not recommend whether or not I should receive my second dose. She proscribed 20mg of Prednisone and refilled my albuterol prescription. About 20 hours later, my breathing is still difficult and my arm still itches.  We also discussed that the respiratory symptoms could be caused or exasperated by COVID-19, so I am waiting on results from a covid test.

Medical history and concomitant drugs were none. The patient reported experiencing a rash. The rash started on her wrist and has just progressed worse in the past few days. She got her shot on Saturday. Her rash fist appeared on Sunday or Monday, she cannot totally recall. The rash has continued to progress worse. Caller states the rash was all over the body. The caller states she has to assume this is a reaction to the vaccine, it&#39;s too coincidental not to be. The caller is just wondering if there is any information on what she can do about the rash, if it is safe to get the second vaccine and if she can receive a steroid shot. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Patient reported that she experienced swelling and pain at the injection site on 11Jan2021, she didn&#39;t feel any pain until that night around 4 or 5pm. By Thursday, 14Jan2021, she woke up and felt better, she didn&#39;t have any pain or swelling. Patient reported that on 18Jan2021, on the right side of her face under her jaw she noticed her lymph node was swollen and she described it as &#34;not terrible just a constant pain.&#34; She would like to know if this was a common side effect, and if how long should she wait before she could contact her doctor about this side effect. These were the only symptoms she experienced. The swelling has stayed the same. She did not know if the swollen lymph node could be from the COVID vaccine or not. Patient stated if the swollen lymph node was not a part of the symptoms for the COVID vaccine, she definitely needs to go see a doctor. The events were considered as non-serious by the reporter. The events did not require a visit to emergency room nor the physician office. The outcome of swollen lymph node and lymph node pain was not recovered; while pain and swelling at injection site recovered on 14Jan2021.

                                                About 1.5-2 hours post immunization the patient returned having developed a headache and a quarter sized welt that was lightly red, swollen and very tender to touch, just below her left collar bone about 4 inches from the injection site. The welt was outlined and observed and the patient was given 25mg of Benadryl. After about 20 minutes the swelling and tenderness had spread to an area approximately the diameter of a tennis ball. At this point she was refered to see a doctor at the Health Center. The nurse called to follow-up once the patient arrived as she had not seen this type of reaction after the vaccine. After discussion the physician was going to look at her. Reportedly the swelling had begun to retract and the patient apparently returned to work later that day, talking about her plans to receive the second dose.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

A 23-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot No: EL 3247), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 28Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma and anaemia. The patient previously took amoxicillin, advil [ibuprofen], ibuprofen and experienced Allergies to medications. Patient received the vaccine on Thursday, 28Jan2021. That night she had extreme pain at the injection site. She could barely lift her arm without having a sharp pain. It felt like she could barely move it, it felt very heavy. Even when not moving my arm, there was a dull burning pain that was present. This pain continued into the next day, Friday, 29Jan2021. On Friday night, the pain was slowly subsiding. On Saturday, 30Jan2021, there was still a dull pain but she was able to move her arm and do daily activities again and she felt a lot better. On Sunday, 31Jan2021 her arm was completely normal again and there was no more pain. The patient received no treatment.  Outcome of the events was recovered on 31Jan2021.

After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

A 23-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (vaccine location=left arm) on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization at a workplace clinic. Medical history included unspecified allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. She was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient experienced sore arm after injection, nausea, muscle aches, headache, and fatigue on 01Feb2021. No treatment received for the events. The events were reported as non-serious (did not result to death, not life threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, and not congenital anomaly/birth defect). Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Do see a dermatologist for other skin issues (acne), saw dermatologist today (two days after symptoms appeared) said it could be related to the vaccine and did not think it was anything of concern but more of an immune response.

Hasn?t gone down yet, but it?s about the size of an apple. Slight fever in the evenings. On night 11, bumpy rash on the neck and back were visible. I felt better after taking a Zyrtec and inhaler. Neck/back rash have gone away but the injection site is still inflamed. It?s a 3 inch circle on my left arm with the injection site at the center. I have no reason to believe it?s a bruise, I have not bumped that area of my left arm anytime within the past month. To the best of my knowledge, I haven?t taken anything that would trigger an allergy

A 23-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 02Mar2021, 16:15, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, covid back in Dec2020, known allergies to flu vaccine and TB test and seizure (have history). Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA), lamotrigine (LAMICTAL), cenobamate (XCOPRI) and magnesium. The patient had no other vaccine in 4 weeks. On 02Mar2021 16:15, the patient experienced arm swelling, pain, itching, couldn&#39;t feel lower legs, extreme chest pains and chills. On 02Mar2021, at 17:15, the patient experienced headache an hour later. On 03Mar2021 01:00, the patient experienced seizure at the middle of the night around 01:00. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had Covid prior vaccination; and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of event seizure was not recovered; outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient had underlying epilepsy. However, based on the close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the development of seizure cannot be excluded.

                                                The first day I got my vaccine, I felt  fine, but my arm with the injection sight was very sore and body slightly achy. The second day I woke up and my arm was sore, but other than that I felt normal. Around 4pm on the second day, my back started to hurt where the break break in my spine is. It was just a normal amount of pain at first, but within an hour there was throbbing pain in my lower back, spreading into my legs. This is where I normally feel my chronic pain, but I had a spinal injection a little over 6 months ago and doesn&#39;t usually stop working until about a year. It is the normal pain I experience in the normal places, but the pain is worse and out of no where. That is not usually how the pain comes on when the spinal block wears off. It is much more gradual. It could be a coincidence, but the pain is not the way I have ever experienced the pain.  My back hurts too much to do things I need to do to function, which only happens to me when I have done something with a lot of physical activity that puts tension on my back like jumping, dancing, roller coasters. Before I started experiencing this pain, it was just a normal day for me where I didn&#39;t exert my back any more than normal, which is very little.

                                                At 4 am on Sunday I woke up with chills, severe body aches, a fever off and on thorough out the day, extreme fatigue. I treated with Tylenol on a strict schedule and that helped everything minus the headache. This morning I woke up fine but this afternoon my arm felt hot and looked down and noticed a bright red rash that?s 4 inches in width and about 1 inch tall on my arm. Since noticing it has not gone down in size but maintained. My arm is swollen at the injection site as well as extremely warm and somewhat painful.

                                                I got my vaccine on 3/19 at 10am. My 6:30 pm on 3/19 my face got dark red, almost purple and started to swell. I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

                                                Four days after my second dose, I woke up to hives on my back thighs. It then spread all over my legs, up my back and behind, and on my arms. I immediately called my doctor and he told me to use over-the-counter antihistamines such as Benadryl/diphenhydramine for Claritin 10 mg once or twice daily, or Zyrtec 10 mg once or twice daily or alternating Claritin and Zyrtec for more severe cases and supplementing with diphenhydramine 25 mg every 6 to 8 hours.  My doctor believes the reaction was due to my second COVID vaccine.   I ended up taking 2 pills of the 12 hour Allegra 2x a day, depending on when the hives would start up again. Two in the morning and two at night.

                                                While waiting in after the vaccination I experience the slightest discomfort with my breathing but thought it might be related to double masking. Upon driving home, I realized I had non-itchy and non-painful hives on the upper portion of my right cheek and the lower jaw on the left side. As time progressed, the hives disappeared from left side and moved down the right side of my face. After it passed on the right side it reappeared on the left side and followed the same pattern. My dermatographia also returned on my chest and I haven&#39;t had an episode of it for over year. The roof of my mouth was also itchy. All hives, itchy mouth, and slight breathing discomfort passed by 7 pm without the use of an antihistamine. No other signs of allergic reaction has been noted since. Breathing concerns passed the quickest (after 2 or so hours), then itchy mouth, and last the non-itchy hives. Other than that, I experienced the common side effect of body aches during the night and pain in vaccinated arm.

                                                I noticed a petechia rash on my legs the day after I received the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, April 06, 2021, I noticed the rash spreading around my chest area, neck area, thighs, and arms as the following days progressed. On Friday, April 09, 2021, I made an appointment at the Student Health Center where I was seen by clinician,  who requested I get blood labs done. After results showed that my platelet count was 30,000, she immediately referred me to the ER at Hospital. She informed that it was an adverse side effect to my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she also informed me that it was a very rare instance and there are cases of other individuals that this has also happened to. Dr. informed me my situation was extremely dangerous and could have potentially been fatal if I had not decided to seek medical attention. I was admitted into the  Hospital on April 09, and was discharged on Monday, April 12, 2021. While I was in the hospital, that Friday 04/09 I received a blood transfusion for my low platelet count, it did not show much improvement, I was diagnosed with ITP by clinician  who is a clinician within the Hematology and Oncology department.  Dr. also informed me that this seemed to be an adverse side effect to the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine, Dr.then recommended I receive steroids for 4 consecutive days to increase my platelet count. The date of my discharge 04/12, my platelet count was 20,000 which is still considered extremely low but due to steroids that were given to me for 4 days, Dr.agreed that this would hopefully increase my platelet count.

The fever went from 100.1 to 102.2 over the course of about an hour (11:30pm-12:30pm), at which time I took 400mg of ibuprofen. The fever was 102.1 thirty minutes after taking the ibuprofen. Along with the fever I experienced tachycardia, body and muscle aches, and moderate to severe deltoid pain at the injection site. I believe the fever broke around 3:00am. The fatigue and body aches lasted about 24 hours since they began, but the majority  of the rest of my symptoms were gone after the fever. The arm pain at injection site was noticeable and painful for about 72 hours before subsiding.

I do have little bit pain on it; Vaccine administrator put the vaccine in the wrong part of the arm; She put further behind her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 24-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acne. Concomitant medication included spironolactone for acne. The patient was reporting an adverse reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She had two concerns. One concern was that she found that the vaccine administrator put the vaccine in the wrong part of the arm, she said, she put further behind her arm, these were her words and she complains that her right leg hurts when she sits down. She said, she works 12 Hours a day and the pain starts shooting down from her arm to her leg, the injection site is red and swollen and she was not taking any medication to alleviate the symptoms. On 31Dec2020, it was reported that the patient was little bit concerned the area, she stated, &#34;I know it is supposed to be swollen for few days but today it is still swollen, its red. I do have little bit pain on it but I was a little bit concerned because I was told by my coworkers and nurses. I am not sure they put it in the right area so I guess the nurse administered the vaccine, she put it like instead of like where they normally put the vaccine, she put it at the side of my arm like, not like behind my arm like normally, I was a little bit of concerned. Another symptom that I have been feeling that whenever I sit down my left leg hurts so much like I have been on my feet like, I am working for 12 hours straight away so I have been working on my feet for pretty much the entire day so every time I sat down only my side hurts, on the side where I take the vaccine, I don&#39;t know if there is everything to do with that, it is like tolerable pain but (sentence incomplete).&#34; No treatment for the events. The outcome of the events injection site is red and swollen was not recovered and unknown for the other events.  Information on batch number has been requested.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

Reports she spoke with her healthcare provider and was told there was no concern about this vaccine. Received vaccine and within a few minutes red blotchy hives spread up her arms, neck and torso.  EMS responded. Client reported this was a common response for her and stated she has had about 8 similar episodes over the last several months. After about 20 minutes the rash continued. No difficulty breathing had occurred, however the client then reported  that occasionally  some tightness in her breathing occurred after about 45 minutes. After initially declining to be transported to the ER, she agreed to be transported to be monitored.  Client declined the use of the stretcher and walked out with EMS to be transported to the ER for observation.

When I got home the body aches got worse and I started getting severe chills and could not stop shaking. That night was difficult to sleep because of the pain I was in. When I woke up the next day, 01/30/2021, I was dizzy, severe fatigue, had severe migraines, I could not breathe when standing up and moving around, my heart was racing, and it felt like I had a sun burn all over my body. I called the nursing coordinator for that day and asked what to do and she said to go to the ER. When I arrived at the ER, they said I had 100 degree temp., I was tacky. They gave me medicine for the pain and the doctor said I was having a adverse reaction to the vaccine but by the next day I would feel better. I went home and slept after the ER all day and night and by Sunday 01/31/2021, I was feeling better after excedrine and advil

My arm the injection was given in was swollen and raised and red and warm to the touch . The swelling lasted for about 5 days and started on the eve of the injection day. The next morning, 1/14/2021, I woke up with bone pain, body aches, fatigue, and a swollen lymph node on my left lower neck. I had chills, but never ran a fever. I also suffered from headache on 1/14/2021. On 1/15/2021, I woke up and all symptoms had resolved.

                                                I had nerve pain 8 on pain scale on 1/7, mostly centered on my back along my spine but when it was at its worst it was anywhere my skin was in contact with anything. First started feeling like my back itched at around 6:30pm. At 8:30pm, I started feeling exhausted and feverish. I took my temperature, it was 100.6 F, I took acetaminophen (2, 650mg tablets).  My symptoms did not get better and I started having chills and pain like needles stabbing me anywhere my clothes were touching me. I went to bed at around 11pm and tried to sleep unsuccessfully until 3am, tossing and turning in pain anywhere my skin was being touched, before trying ibuprofen (600mg, the dose I take for my migraines) which seemed to help and I finally fell asleep.  Next morning woke up feverish, exhausted, and in pain again. Once again ibuprofen helped and I continued taking it every 8 hours for the next day until my symptoms were no longer coming back when the dose was wearing off.

                                                I had several adverse side effects from the vaccine (which I was expecting given it was my second dose). I woke up with a slight fever that lasted two days (highest point being 102.5*F, but it ebbed and flowed throughout the period). I had nausea (threw up twice, was able to keep food down by the evening of the first day after getting the vaccine). I had chills as well, and standard body aches and headaches that often accompany fevers and chills. My arm was also sore at the injection site, as with most vaccines, but it was actually bizarrely most sore at my armpit, not at the injection site.

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                Lump and redness at the injection site appeared a day after receiving the vaccine, and then 3 days after the vaccine I had severe shoulder pain and I couldn&#39;t move my arm in certain directions and I couldn&#39;t sleep on my shoulder. I tried to rest and take ibuprofen but nothing was helping the pain and I went to my health center a week after I received the vaccine and they said I was having too much of a localized inflammatory response and to alternate between ibuprofen and tylenol and use heat but the pain is still there and it&#39;s been almost 3 weeks.

                                                Anaphylaxis - Throat swelled almost completely closed, wheezing, lightheadedness (nearly passed out), throat/neck and injection site were very itchy and swollen, face/eyes swelled up, turned very pale all over, heart palpitations, etc. The next day - severe, horribly painful burning sensation all throughout my body.  Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I am now 30 weeks pregnant and the reason I went to see my hematologist is because my platelets dropped. I had lab work done the week of 02-22-2021 through 02-26-2021. I also had soreness at the injection site and a palpable lymph node under my armpit that was present for 24 hours then it resolved. I will also be receiving treatment with IV, IG and prednisone medication starting this week of 03-15-2021 through       03-19-2021.

                                                Left deltoid pain began at about 2:30 pm, approximately 3 hours after vaccine was administered in that arm. Pain progressed throughout the next few hours but was moderate. Around 11:30 pm the pain became more severe, to the point where any deltoid movement caused extreme pain. I used an ice pack to try to alleviate the pain but it only provided mild relief. When changing my shirt around this time I touched the area lightly and saw it was slightly swollen with fluid around the site of vaccination. Continued using ice because I had not eaten recently and did not want to take ibuprofen on an empty stomach and cause heartburn. I was unable to sleep on my left side and woke up around 4:30 am in severe pain, put ice on it again and fell back asleep. I had a low grade fever of about 99.4 F at this time and some chills. On 3/16 I woke up around 9:30 am and pain was still fairly moderate-severe and swelling was present but less than the night before. Around 10:00 am I ate breakfast and took ibuprofen, and the pain and swelling have been more moderate since.

                                                After my second dose of Pfizer vaccine, I developed fever, chills, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, hypersensitive skin to touch (not a rash, but my skin is more sensitive and a light rubbing on skin all over my body could cause pain).  I also had several series of premature heart beat.

A 24-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) at left arm on 15Feb2021 (24-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. There were no concomitant medications in two weeks. The patient did not received any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) at left arm on 25Jan2021 at 09:00 (24-year-old at time of vaccination) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced red and hot rash on the same arm (located in the crease of the elbow and about 5 inches in diameter) from 01Feb2021 at 08:00; received cortisone for the rash (it got better). Rash got worse again a few days after second dose in Feb2021. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient did not test COVID post vaccination. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event and included cortisone. The outcome of the event was recovering.

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

                                                Starting January 4th, 2021, I noticed that I was itching on my chest and found a rash localized to my medial chest. The rash didn&#39;t appear to grow from the area. Later, on January 9th, I began to itch more on my lower back of neck and upper back and had someone take a look. They noted I had a rash in the upper back as well. Taking another claritin, tylenol, and using hydrocortisone cream has not helped with the rash.

After second vaccine, only symptom was soreness in the injection site for approximately the first 20 hours. Shortly after that I started experiencing chills and fatigue. Afebrile at 98.2F. Took an OTC Ibuprofen tablet and symptoms subsided. That same night fatigue and chills returned as well as I started experiencing a headache. By the morning headache subsided after a OTC Tylenol tablet but fatigue remained.

On 1/1 the itching started spreading throughout my body. I have continuously been itching since 12/31. The itching is all over my scalp, arms, hands, back, and legs. I have recently developed a pain/pressure in the back of my head, that feels like I have smacked it against a wall. I have also recently developed pain in my chest. I have seen my PCP, dermatologist, and ED drs and no one can find a route cause for my reaction.

                                                Immediately got redness of injection site feeling of nausea. Needed to take my mask off to get fresh air.  Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid, on 29Dec2020 at 18:40 (at the age of 25-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced broke out in hives all over her body on 03Jan2021, which was reported as medically significant. The patient also didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable and areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened on 03Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received her first dose of the vaccine on 29Dec2020 and said 5 days later she broke out in hives. The patient stated her hives began on the evening of 03Jan2021. She clarified she had hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable. She said she still had areas on her legs and ankles that were reddened. She said the reddened areas on her legs and ankles are not fully raised or itchy, like she had experienced with the hives on the rest of her body. The patient went to an urgent care on 06Jan2021. She saw a dermatologist for the hives on 07Jan2021, who suspected that since she did not have any prior history of hives, her hives are from the COVID-19 vaccine. She said the dermatologist told her there is no way to truly test if the vaccine caused her hives. The patient received an intramuscular unspecified steroid shot at the dermatologist and was prescribed methylprednisolone (MANUFACTURED BY: PAR PHARMACEUTICAL; Lot number: 1129091; Expiration date: Dec2021) 4 mg tablets in a taper dose pack. She also stated that she took the following over-the-counter medications: diphenhydramine hydrochloride (reported as: generic BENADRYL; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN; Lot number: 0MR0456; Expiration date: Sep2022) 25 mg tablet, taken as needed; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC; Lot number: 1652346; Expiration Date: Dec2021) 10 mg tablet, taken as one tablet up to four times a day; and hydrocortisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) cream. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all of the events as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of broke out in hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable was recovering and of areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3248), via intramuscular route of administration on 13Jan2021 at 13:35 (at the age of 25-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included asthma that is fairly mild (the patient has rescue inhaler that she does not use very often, she uses it once every few months as needed.  Diagnosed in early childhood when she was 4-5 years old). The patient had no relevant family medical history.  Concomitant medications included an unspecified medication, the patient reported she has been taking it for years, but did not provide further information. Historical vaccine included flu shot in Nov2020, which was greater than 4 weeks prior to receiving the COVID-19 vaccination.

On 14Jan2021 at 10:00, the patient experienced hives on back, arm, knee, toe and hands. The reported clinical course was as follows: Initially, on the first day, she had itching not at injection site.  It was on different parts of her body.  The following day, she developed hives on her back, arm, knee, toe and hands.  The patient reported it is not very severe, she did not have any fever, swelling, or shortness of breath. The patient reported some of the areas have gone down and some have inflamed more. The patient did not undergo any relevant test and reported just visual examination.

A week later on January 15 I started to itch from head to toe all over my body. On January 25 woke up with hives/rash that is on and off all over my body. I am still itchy and still occasionally have the rash. Have been to my pcp and a dermatologist and as of 1/9/21 they do not have a reason to how or why this happened.  Nothing in my daily life has changed soaps, detergent, food, drink, work gloves.

                                                8 days after receiving my first dose, Just below the vaccination site on my left arm suddenly became very hot, swollen, and sore. A day later, a round patch just under the injection point remains and is about the diameter of an apple. At the time of the injection, my only side effects were a sore arm and a bruise. The soreness was gone but the bruise still remains.

                                                About 30 seconds after the injection I felt a strange sharp pain right under where the injection site was. I was advised to sit near the nurses station for 30 minutes instead of 15 due to my medical history. One of the nurses came by to check on me and as we were chatting my entire left shoulder and up my neck suddenly got red and rashy. I looked down and both of my arms were rashy as well. I began to experience itching everywhere. The nurse gave me 50 mg of benedryl and monitored me for about 40 minutes. The rash went down and they had my husband come pick me up. I called my pcp and advised them or the situation. She asked to keep her informed and if anything got worse to administer the Epi-Pen and go to the ER. Once home I slept for about 5 1/2 hours and then woke up in the afternoon. I had a minor headache and my arm had started to swell, but the rash was completely gone. As of today my arm is still red and swollen under the injection site, and itches quite a lot.

                                                fatigue; Throat tightness; sore throat; Rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 25-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 06Mar2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6025) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies: Penicillin. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Concomitant medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), took the week prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced rash (Amoxicillin tablets. Had allergic reaction when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime).   The patient experienced sore throat, throat tightness and rash, all on 06Mar2021 14:30. Clinical course: After receiving COVID 19 Vaccine, within one to two minutes of vaccine very strong sore throat and tightening of the throat. Was taken to emergency room by the ambulance that was at the testing center. At that time the ambulance at testing center recommended taking two Benadryl&#39;s, which started to work and sore throat and tightness completely went away about 15 minutes after that and then started to come back at time of riding in ambulance to the ER. While being written up and vitals checked, the rash (blotchy) developed to which she was given a Solumedrol steroid shot to fix the rash which amazingly cleared up rash and it ended up back to white. Had amazing clear photos of rash and it being red and sloshes starting to appear. After caller left ER and went home and had couple of follow up prescriptions of Pepcid and Atarax to help combat rash for two days. Now she was taking Allegra still for adverse events. Reporter mentioned sore throat was on and off but it had improved and still had a little bit of a rash. Caller had a little bit of tightness and it had improved if she exerted herself a lot the tightness got worse she wsn&#39;t referring to a big exertion but provided example like if she is going to the grocery store. The rash was severely reduced but was apparent. Caller also mentioned she had pretty severe fatigue after receiving vaccine unsure if this was because of the vaccine or an allergic reaction to some medication in her. She missed work on Monday and part time on Tuesday due to having to take breaks and naps during the day. Caller went into work but she did not feel up to working a full day in the office and was working remotely from home right now. The patient had allergic reaction to amoxicillin tablets when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime. Caller stated she knew how important it is to report not sure if there is an association between Amoxicillin and COVID ingredients. May have another allergy that was contributing but Amoxicillin was only other known allergy. Caller was asking for the next steps since she still has not fully recovered her throat, she is still feeling sore and tighter than normal and her skin was still redder than normal. When she had the rash it was red blotchy and warm to the touch it was no longer warm to the touch. Outcome of the events sore throat, throat tightness and rash was recovering, of event fatigue was unknown.

                                                I began having hives on my chest late Thursday night on the 18th, I took Benadryl to try and ease the hives. I continued to have hives spread across my chest, both arms, stomach, and the back of my knees from the 18-22, I suddenly lost my voice on the 21st when I woke up in the morning. I went to a park view clinic in my town on the 22nd and received treatment for my hives. As of the 24th I am taking medications prescribed to me and my hives are slowly going away and my voice is coming back. I have also experienced nasal drainage and a cough from the 19 and onward.

It started in her scalp, moved to her face, and then onto her throat. She was at work at this time. I advised her to take a 25 mg Benadryl (which may cause drowsiness). Based on her size (145 lbs) employee did not recommend she take a 50 mg Benadryl. Patient did not know if she had a fever or not. She reported NO fever at that time. Employee called her back at 6:30 PM to check on her. She said she had to leave work around 2 pm; she was feeling bad, achey. She said she took some ibuprofen as she was feeling achey and feverish. she didn&#39;t feel the need to go to the doctor or urgent care at this time.

I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

I did not do anything for the symptoms at that time.  I was just drinking water and waiting for those symptoms going away and they went away in about four- six hours.  Doctor check-up the following Monday for these symptoms but the hives were gone. I was nauseous for about four days. I was kind of tired. At injection site - it was kind of red and swollen but those went away after one day - that I got when I had the hives and irritated/swollen throat. I started having dizziness - a few hours after the vaccine and that lasted for about six days where I would get dizzy on and off throughout the day.  I had my second vaccine on February 6 2021. I was recovered from these adverse events before 2nd dose.

                                                I felt itching right after taking the vaccine. I stayed for 30 min and it was not getting worse. The next day, when I waked up, my left arm is swelling and itching. Redness appears as an allergy symptom. The itching, swelling,  redness did not go off until today, which has been a week after the vaccine. The symptom is only limited to the left arm, near the injection site.

                                                My daughter experienced immediate nerve pain at the site, L deltoid; followed by radiation to her fingers.  Then, she complained of extreme muscle pains, all over; itching and shortness of breath with formation of mucus in her chest.  She has interstitial lung disease and is well aware of what mucus-filling in her chest (lungs) feels like.  She also had headache and coughing and this necessitated using Benadryl 50mg, her Xopenex rescue inhaler at the site; followed by contacting of her pulmonologist for future treatment and instructions.

                                                new onset cardiac murmur; fever; petechial rash; This is spontaneous report received from a contactable nurse. A 25-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6202), via intramuscular route on 11Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included penicillin allergy. Concomitant medication received within two weeks included birth control. No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 23Mar2021, the patient experienced new onset cardiac murmur, fever, and petechial rash. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient had been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. She underwent COVID-19 nasal swab test on 23Mar2021 with negative result. Outcome of events was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information provided is limited and does not allow for a complete medical assessment.  Based on temporal association a contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events  cannot  be totally excluded.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Swelling and redness of the arm within an hour after the vaccine. Tingling began in middle, ring, and pinky fingers within 20 minutes of injection. Numbness began within the first hour. Within two hours, I lost strength and 60% use of my left hand. The pinky and ring finger of my left hand have been either completely numb or tingling ever since my shot over one week ago.   I noticed mild numbness about 3-4 days after the first dose, but assumed I had just slept funny. When my arm became red and hand became tingly after my second dose, I realized this was an effect of the vaccine and not merely a pinched nerve in my sleep.

                                                I had the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 4/6 and felt dizzy 30 minutes later. The dizziness continued for the next 84 hours. On 4/9 (three days after vaccination), I fainted on my  driveway as I was heading home around noon time. I felt dizzy the whole afternoon but were trying to help out the groceries from the car. I fell down on the concrete driveway with two bags of groceries on my hand. I did not blackout, but were not able to get up for 10 seconds due to the dizziness. I eventually recovered from the dizziness 84 hours after the first dose of vaccine. I injured my knee as I fell, but the wound were treated at home immediately.  As for the sore arm, I could not hold any items heavier than 1 lb. The arm soreness went away after 48 hours with ice pack applied on upper arm(injection area).
