                                                She got her 2nd vaccine, and almost immediately into her shoulder had pain in her shoulder blade and into her neck and had a lymph node on the right side of her chin/upper neck, then she has another one that is smaller and back further, and possibly a third one that is almost to the right side of her neck, tiny in nature.  None on the left side at all.  She felt that they would eventually go away and didn&#39;t do anything about it.  She went to see her Dr., and he did a neck scan on 4/7/21, and reported that it was not cancer and told her to watch it, but if they were there in 4 months that they would have to be removed, they are still there.    They have not changed in size.  She has not gotten any more either.  She definitely can feel the two and the third one is there but tiny.   Her arm is still very sore at the site of the shot at the muscle.  Almost daily at the site it gets very very sore and she gets chills and has to lie down due to exhaustion that lasts about 40 minutes and has to go lay down and then she gets back up once the chills pass.   She was having it every day at noon almost every day, and still continues pretty much on a daily basis, but the arm is still very sore.

The patient experienced palm of hands itching, knee might itch a bit on 27Jan2021. Patient reported she walked outside for about a half an hour; she didn&#39;t have anything on her hands. However, when she came back inside, her hands were really itching, specifically the palm of her hands. She has never had this happen before. She came back inside and took her mask and coat off and when she started to get warm, her hands started itching. She stated it&#39;s like the cold caused the itching or something. The itching has stayed the same. It was just itchy. She stated her knee might itch a bit, but her hands are really itching. She was not given her vaccine record card. Her facility is saving it and will give it to her after her second vaccine. No investigation assessment reported. Event outcome was not recovered.    Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

This 91-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included high blood pressure, kidney cancer, cancer in her bladder 20 years ago and coughing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), ascorbic acid (VIT C), losartan potassium for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate for blood pressure, amlodipine for blood pressure, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81). Patient had cancer in her bladder 20 years ago. That was taken care of. Had kidney cancer because her husband used to smoke and blow it in her face. Had rare type of kidney cancer. It was removed. Treated for bladder cancer. Patient has had no problem ever since and that was more than 18 years ago. Patient had a fever, headache, and was very tired. Burning up on side of the body and she got all wet. This was not normal and she felt like she was dying. Patient stated she had shingles and developed post herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had pain at the bottom of her foot but it was getting worse after she received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Patient noticed the liquid going thru arm to chest and in straight line to her leg, like a science fiction movie with an injection of some kind. The doctor thought the vaccine might have an impact on the nervous system and spike the symptoms of post herpetic neuralgia. Patient spoke to her doctor but nobody knows anything. Nobody was willing to help her. Patient felt like she was dying. She didn&#39;t want to die. Patient feel the symptoms are getting worst. She was burning up inside. Her pain was around the bottom of the foot now it&#39;s on top of the foot and goes up to knee. Patient was not blaming anybody but she thought it was the vaccine. Patient was sweating, wet, perspiring all night. The symptoms usually occur at night. Patient wanted to know if these symptoms were associated with the vaccine. Patient also mentioned she developed a bladder infection for which she was taking antibiotics. Patient had Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021, about 5 days ago. Patient followed instructions before vaccine. Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn&#39;t have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn&#39;t remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days. Doctor wanted her to get a urine test, but she couldn&#39;t urine, patient tried for a long time in the bathroom and only got a few drops of urine out and it was brown. Not normal urine. Next day patient called 911. She wanted to be assured she was not dying at home. Did have room available at the hospital. Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again. Really thought she was burning up. Patient didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital and suffered at home. Next night and third night was so bad. Patient couldn&#39;t urinate anymore. She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn&#39;t miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn&#39;t urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn&#39;t handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn&#39;t sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn&#39;t think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn&#39;t get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty. Had so much constipation for a long time and tried to correct it with mediation. Medication was too strong and gave her diarrhea. Doctor thought maybe she had colon cancer. Stopped the medication. Wasn&#39;t 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg. Provided: V11496, MSRS 53041 REV 0417, and 883928. Patient no longer has constipation. Now it is the opposite. Now bowel movements are soft and pasty. Patient tried a stool softener that didn&#39;t work, was worthless. Was over the counter. Patient didn&#39;t take stool softeners after the COVID-19 Vaccine. All the events started from Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 91-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: unknown, NDC number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Feb2021 15:30 (at the age of 91-year-old) as single dose To protect from Covid virus. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination; Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity) was none. Illness/AE: None. Pertinent Details (include surgical procedures and dates): N/A. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s): None. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient experienced Dizziness, Lightheadedness, broke out in a rash; very itchy rash, blisters on both arms, from elbows to hands, upper forearm, face and neck, red and blotchy on both arms, forearms to fingers, arms were so inflamed and itchy. The patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and developed a rash on both arms 6 days post vaccination. The reporter had noticed on day 8 (09Feb2021) a huge blister on her arm. She also felt light headed. The reporter thinks these side effects were related to the vaccine and wanted to know if they are reported with the vaccine. She also wanted to know whether the patient could get the second dose of the vaccine. It was reported that seems to be having a reaction to the first Pfizer Covid-19 shot. A couple days later, she had dizziness and lightheadedness and then days after, Day 6 (07Feb2021), that broke out in a rash. Yesterday, day 8 (09Feb2021), she had blisters on the arm and there is no other reason for her to have them, it wasn&#39;t like she did anything. Blisters are on both arms from elbows to hands. Had a little bit on the face and neck, none on her trunk, just on the upper forearm and hands. Is there anyone who has reported this reaction. Still had the rash and blisters, they had not changed. It was a very itchy rash, kind of red and blotchy on both arms, forearms to fingers. Had nothing where the injection was, it was just from the elbow down. Did go to the doctor yesterday (09Feb2021), for the rash and blisters and they had no idea what it was. Her arms were so inflamed and itchy they gave Methylprednisolone tablets to help. The patient did not visit Emergency Room, but visited Physician Office for dizziness, lightheadedness, rash, very itchy rash, blisters on both arms, from elbows to hands, upper, forearm, face and neck, red and blotchy on both arms, forearms to fingers, arms were so inflamed and itchy. No Investigation Assessment. No Relevant Tests. Outcome of the event felt lightheaded/dizziness was recovering and all other events were not recovered.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

A 91-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included history of atrial fibrillation real bad where her heart has leaky valves and takes a lot of medicines. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included unspecified medications for atrial fibrillation which were considered as co suspects. Caller states she needs to know. She got the first Covid-19 vaccine yesterday (09Feb2021) and the nurse that had to put it in her, she felt it and it hurt. Her other friends said they couldn&#39;t tell they were getting a shot, but she did and it hurt. Where she went to get it was organized and wonderful and she got the shot about 12:00. Before it got to 6pm she was really aching there in her left arm and shoulder high up. Instead of a soreness she had pain. Had pain this morning and last night and didn&#39;t sleep good at all and couldn&#39;t even take off her pajama top. It was reported that she has history of atrial fibrillation real bad where her heart has leaky valves and takes a lot of medicines. She has some Tylenol in the house but does not know with her heart condition if it is alright to take the Tylenol for the pain or should she not take it. Has not taken any pain killers last night for fear of not knowing what it would do. The facility where she had the shot she was taken to since she does not drive and it was very well organized and all. Was very glad to get this vaccine and if people in the county can take it eventually it can be cured. Again, mentions having so many friends say they didn&#39;t have any problems and not to worry about getting the shot and she was filled with so much hope. The literature says you can have some joint pains and tiredness and her problem is wondering if she can take Tylenol to ease the pain. No further details provided. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number is requested.

                                                shingles; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient).   A 91-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number was not reported), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Deltoid Left on 28Jan2021 15:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. On 30Jan2021, she began to see shingles starting under her breast, and it went into full blown shingles. She first noticed shingles barely under one breast, she noticed a little bit of a rash start and then it got worse and went all the way to her spine. It is kind of scabbing over now and she still has the deep pain. She did not have a problem with the itch, but she did have deep pain. She was not sure if it was coincidental. She was wondering if she should take the next shot. hcp gave her a medication, Valtrex, that he did not think would work since she was seen a week or two later after seeing the shingles and it should be taken when the shingles first starts. She took all of it. Patient does not think it was life threatening. she mentioned she had a problem with shakiness. Height was about 5&#39;2&#34;, she shrunk. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no AE prior vaccinations. The outcome of the event was recovering.      Information on lot/ batch number has been requested.

A 92-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration (upper arm) on 20Jan2021 11:00 (at the age of 92years) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included breast cancer, second right breast lumpectomy related to breast cancer from 16Oct2020 to an unknown date, first right breast lumpectomy related to breast cancer on an unknown date (done about 3-4 years prior to second right breast lumpectomy related to breast cancer), on blood thinner, allergic to the statins and allergy to unknown product (She was once given something, some medication for her heart, but about 5- 6 weeks later she developed a reaction to it so she was taken off the medication but does not remember the name of the drug.) The patient would consider herself obese at this weight, but that is probably because she was always very thin historically; her doctor has never diagnosed her as being obese or advised her to lose weight. The patient&#39;s daughter had a very, very aggressive form of breast cancer-she is deceased 11 years. Patient&#39;s younger sister had breast cancer; there is a lot of breast cancer on her husband&#39;s side- his mother, sister, niece all had breast cancer, they have a big history of breast cancer; other types of cancer in patient&#39;s family include her mother who died of pancreatic cancer in her 80s; and her dad had prostate cancer but he was in his upper 80s; and patient&#39;s older sister died of leukemia. Concomitant medications included warfarin from an unspecified date at 5 mg (daily x 2 days/week) then 2.5 mg (daily x remaining 5 days/week) as blood thinner and metoprolol from an unspecified date at 25 mg, 2x/day (morning and evening) for an unspecified indication. The patient previously had Flu shot. The patient reported that she got on last Thursday (21Jan2021) the first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine at 11 o&#39;clock. She did not feel anything wrong at the moment (also reported as she had no immediate reaction at all). A couple of days after (About maybe 2-3 days later sort of in the middle of the day, not the morning) she started to feel extremely unwell, feverish (although thermometer did not indicate any raise) tired and malaise she was really surprised because it occurred that long after administration. She took Tylenol and she was looking to know if this has been reported as a side effect of the vaccine and how to treat it. She was very concerned about it because she has never had an adverse event with any vaccine or inoculation before. She takes a yearly flu shot and never had any reaction. Feverish: She has taken her body temperature with her digital thermometer which does not show a fever, it shows like 97.5-97.6 degrees Fahrenheit so not a fever; but she feels feverish. On 26Jan2021 the injection site started itching and she looked at site which is way up high so she can&#39;t turn her neck that way; but found a strange area around the injection site that is about the size of a silver dollar, red around the outer rim and kind of orangeish colored in the middle. She has never had that occur before, and the skin in the middle of the area, the orangeish colored area has no pain. She reported that there was a mass of people at the location where she was administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. There were hundreds of people there when she was for inoculation event so she is wondering if she could have picked up COVID while there. She called to ask about these events related to the product.  She has no major allergies. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on an unspecified date which included body temperature: 97.5-97.6-degree Fahrenheit. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 94-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 (around 3:15 PM to 3:20 PM) at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml dose injection in right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure, cholesterol, blood thinner and fluid. The patient historical vaccine included varicella zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) for immunization. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect as this was the first dose. The patient had no prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included ongoing apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner, ongoing furosemide (LASIX) for fluid, valsartan for blood pressure, ongoing pravastatin for cholesterol. The reporter was calling because her mother had the COVID-19 Vaccine on 07Jan2021, it was on a Thursday. By that Friday (08Jan2021) she was not feeling that well. Caller stated she did not know if what occurred had any correlation to the vaccine, but she wanted to report these details in case this started to be came a problem. Her mother is 94 years old and was in very good shape. However, now she was in the hospital completely disoriented. Since getting the vaccine she had subsequently broke out with shingles two days after getting the vaccine on 09Jan2021. Caller reiterated she was not saying this had anything to do with the vaccine, but she just wanted to reported these events. Caller initially stated it was unknown why patient was admitted to the hospital. She went on to explain her mother, the patient, was complaining of pain and burning. She started complaining of this pain and burning in the evening like around 5PM (on 08Jan2021 17:00). She later broke out into shingles. Caller mentioned patient has not had the SHINGRIX vaccine yet. However, she did have the older vaccine, ZOSTAVAX. Caller confirmed patient received the ZOSTAVAX years before. Patient went to the Emergency Room the first time on 09Jan2021 due to complaining of pain and burning and they could not find anything wrong with her. They checked her vitals and ran several tests and it all came back fine. They then sent her home. Patient went back to the Emergency Room on 10Jan2021 and completed another battery of test, labs, checked vitals, had chest x-ray, and cat scan at this time they could not diagnose with Shingles. On 11Jan2021, the patient had an appointment with her Primary Doctor and he did not find anything wrong. Patient came home with caller&#39;s sister and she was helping her get undressed. That was when the sister noticed a rash on the patient&#39;s body. The rash broke out on her body on Monday 11Jan2021. They tried to call the doctor that night, but did not get a response. On Tuesday 12Jan2021 they took the patient to urgent care and that was when she was formally diagnosed with Shingles. She was started on medication for the Shingles, Acyclovir, and sent home. They also thought she had a slight Urinary Tract Infection. She was started on CIPRO for the urinary tract infection. Patient was home for a couple of days in Jan2021 and she was not getting any better. She was then starting to lose her mental faculties. They thought this was from the urinary tract infection. Caller clarified the patient was then admitted to the hospital on 16Jan2021 due being disoriented. For causality assessment, it was mentioned that it is so coincidental this happened right after getting the vaccine. She was healthy and then it was like a snowball. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

A 95-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Mar2021. The patient was reported to have possible side effects that was getting worse. The patient had &#34;chills, fever, nasal congestion, upper respiratory difficulty breathing, non-productive cough.&#34; On Monday evening, 29Mar2021, the patient was brought to the hospital but tests showed that &#34;everything looked good&#34; (chest x-ray etc.) Last night, the patient&#39;s temperature reached 104 F and was given paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient mentioned that she was &#34;breathing rapid,&#34; and that she &#34;coughs when she takes a breath.&#34; Reporter asked if patient can be given an antihistamine; or something to help with the upper respiratory concern (nose blockage, upper respiratory breathing). The patient had not been well. They spent Monday evening and all night and in the morning at the hospital. They did X-rays and lab work and everything else. The doctors couldn&#39;t find anything wrong with her and stated that it&#39;s got to be the vaccine. She was really in bad shape at this point. She can&#39;t be out of bed for 2 seconds without having to get back into bed. She was having a upper respiratory thing going on. She had a fever as high as 104.5 last night. The fever was last night and she got paracetamol (TYLENOL) for that and brought it down. It did respond. The patient stated she can&#39;t breathe through her nose and she has upper respiratory problems. The problem was when they went to the hospital, they didn&#39;t find signs of infections, all normal across the board. The patient doesn&#39;t fake it, she was a feisty elderly lady. She walks up the hill every day. She was independent. Normally, she can walk and walks very well without any assistance. The patient now can barely walk. She can barely walk to the toilet without holding on to anything. She was constantly complaining about chills. Reporter wanted to know what can they do and not do and what should the doctors be looking at. They kind of just threw up their hands as this was side effects of the vaccine, but the patient was alarming on Monday night and even more alarming right now. The patient was in bad shape. She wasn&#39;t feeling good on Saturday night, but not too bad on Friday night. Reporter asked her mom how she felt on Friday. Reporter told her mom to put in her hearing aids, that would probably help. Reporter further explained that patient had a sore arm around the injection site and that she might not have been feeling that great. On Saturday, she was not feeling well and started to have a fever, sinus infection and upper respiratory problems. The patient stated that she finally identified it. Reporter confirmed the fever, sinus infection, and upper respiratory problems started on 27Mar2021 towards the late afternoon she was  progressively getting worse. Fever, sinus infection, chills, upper respiratory problems all have worsened. The reporter stated that her mother&#39;s (patient&#39;s) arm pain got better on Sunday and was now gone. On Saturday, her arm hurt from her shoulder to her elbow, it did get worse. However, a the next day it was gone pretty much. Monday in the emergency room, they did labs for her kidney, liver and were looking for infection. They did not find anything came up normal on everything. Today, the reporter thinks patient was worse. She doesn&#39;t want to come out of bed at all. She was laying there like a lump, whining and crying which she has never done. She was probably going to take her to the hospital again and  they were not going to do anything again. She stated that something got to change, They haven&#39;t had that conversation about going to the hospital. She was going to go downhill if this continues, it had gone downhill at this point. Reporter confirmed that patient has recovered completely from the arm pain while outcome of remaining events was not recovered.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Excerpt taken from patient&#39;s medical record notes.    Recreational Therapist was in room with patient who was at baseline mentation at that time, and was getting patient a cup of tea.  Rec Therapist observed patient to &#34;all of a sudden slouch down toward left side&#34; and became unresponsive.  Therapist called for help, and Registered Nurse (RN) and Certified Nurse Aide (CNA) came into room.  Patient was initially non-responsive and profusely sweating and hot to touch.  Vitals  were taken (see below).  The patient then slowly became responsive after approximately 4 minutes and was visibly nauseous  and appeared like she was going to vomit, but ultimately did not.  Patient was assisted into bed, APRN was called, order for vital signs to be taken every 4 hours for 72 hours, and Electrocardiogram (EKG) to be performed.   EKG results were abnormal, indicative of infarct; APRN ordered transport to Emergency Department.   Patient returned from Hospital ED at approximately 10:45 PM same day (1/28/21), with transfer paperwork documenting  a  Hospital diagnosis of &#34;Syncope&#34; without any additional lab results or any new medication or treatment orders in the documentation.  Follow up the next day (1/29/21) by RN at the Nursing Facility--RN logged into the Hospital medical Charting system, only to find that there was no record whatsoever of the patient being in the Emergency Department on 1/28/21--no notes, no labs, no summary from a practitioner.  Patient recovered and has resumed close-to-baseline activity and functioning.

                                                up all night; Itching; has small bumps; some areas of redness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 96-year-old female patient (Reporter&#39;s mother) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 08Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation (they hope the mother doesn&#39;t contract COVID). Medical history included stomach issues, blood pressure, cholesterol. Concomitant medication(s) included loperamide hydrochloride (LOMOTIL) taken for stomach issues. The patient experienced itching with, has small bumps, some areas of redness; all (non-serious) on 09Feb2021 and up all night (non-serious) on 10Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of itching (pruritus). Additional Information for Concomitant Products Lomotil, cholesterol and one for blood pressure: Reporter declined to provide any further information for medications such as when her mother began taking these medications, the dosages, or further information related to the medications. Reporter was calling for her mother. Her mother had her initial shot on the 8th, 08Feb2021, and she got up the next morning and was complaining of itching and had some areas of redness and bumps that went around the nape of her neck. She has small bumps around her neck, under her chin, on her chest area going down mid-line- from her chin- and then down under her breast. It itches and she didn&#39;t have that before. Clarified with caller that the shot being discussed is the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Reporter said areas of itching and bumps are still there today, she wanted to wait a little bit to see how it was going to be, but her mother still has it. Her mother does have a sensitivity to medications. You know, a lot of oral medications she can&#39;t really tolerate, it bothers her stomach. She&#39;s not really allergic to anything in particular- caller asked her mother, &#34;are you mom, no.&#34; She just wanted to clarify that information. Her mother does have a sensitive stomach, but the COVID vaccine shouldn&#39;t have anything to do with the stomach. No further details provided on the oral medications that the mother is unable to tolerate that bother her stomach. Two days ago, the caller&#39;s mother had the COVID vaccine on the 08Feb2021 and she woke up that evening. While she was going to bed she noticed she was itching. When she got up in the morning she said she was up itching all night. The reporter says, so we will say 09Feb2021 is when this all started. Reporter makes a comment that her mother is a little thing. The reporter says her mother is about 4&#39;5&#34; 4&#39;6&#34; and her mother says she is 4&#39;9&#34; and the reporter says well she wants to say she is 4&#39;9&#34;. On 08Feb2021 the patient had the COVID vaccine and then she had the itching behind her ears, on her neck, across her chest, and under her breasts. Clarified the date the itching began an 09Feb2021. The patient put something on that eliminated some of the bumps and every now and then the itching and scratching will feel like she&#39;s bleeding, but she is not bleeding anywhere. The bumps are still there. They are still red, the bumps are not red, they are an irritation. Conflicting information obtained in regard to bumps, unable to clarify or obtain further details due to the reporter not wanting to complete the safety report. Some areas of redness: Reporter says it is not really red, it is more off an off-color, pinkish. Reporter states that she can tell there&#39;s an irritation on the patient&#39;s skin from itching. Up all night: The patient was up last night 10Feb2021 when she went to bed. Reporter mentioned that her mother doesn&#39;t always relay information correctly. Company agent is unable to clarify if the inability to relay information correctly began prior to receiving the COVID vaccine or after due to the reporter not wanting to complete the safety report. The patient was up all night itching the last two nights. She feels the itching and gets some relief from an ointment she is using. Reporter is not sure of the name of the ointment off hand, but the patient was provided the ointment it is from the doctor. Unable to probe for NDC, lot number, or expiry date of ointment that only provided some relief to her mother as reporter did not wish to complete the safety report. Probed for NDC, expiry date, and dosage and reporter says this information is not on the vaccination card. Caller says the lot number is an &#34;E&#34; and she can&#39;t make up the next letter before 9262, it&#39;s either EL or E1 and it is separated from 9262, there is a space between them. Lot number is either: EL9262 or E19262 based on information provided from the reporter. Reporter says the mother takes medications everyday. She takes ones for her blood pressure, cholesterol, and Lomotil medication for her stomach issues. Reporter asks how much longer this is going to take and what further questions will be asked. She doesn&#39;t think the rest of the report is necessary she just wanted to report that her mother had the rash and the itching. Unable to clarify information regarding said rash with the reporter as being related to the redness and bumps mentioned previously in the report or if this rash is a different event that was experienced. Medical Conditions: Unable to obtain further information due to reporter not wanting to complete the rest of the safety report. Investigations: When informing the reporter that one question that will be asked for this report is if any testing has been done to what her mother experienced, the reporter says no. Unable to clarify if this means no testing has been completed or no to the reporter not wanting to answer the question at this time since she did not want to complete the safety report. Informed caller that an additional form is part of the safety report, caller declined to complete the safety report so unable to obtain further information and confirm given information to fill out the vaccine supplemental form. Reporter calling on behalf of the side effects experienced from her mother after the COVID vaccine. For all events, outcome was not recovered, except for event up all night, outcome was unknown.

A 96-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 23Feb2021 (at the age of 96years) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included pill for high blood pressure. It was reported that the patient was healthy as a horse and her mind is sharp as a tack; she is slow getting around and does not get around well. It was reported that the patient has received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 23Feb2021. Nine days later (04Mar2021), she has developed itching in her back and at the upper part of her arms. The reporter wanted to know if it would be from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and if the patient should receive the second dose of the vaccine considering her adverse event. It was clarified that the patient did not develop rashes but only itching. The patient has been to a walk-in clinic but was only given Benadryl and Claritin for her condition. It was further reported that the patient was fine, and her arm was not even sore today. The patient developed some itching on her back and arms after 9 days. The reporter asked, since it is that far out would if that have to do with an allergic reaction and related to the vaccine; also asked if it was contraindicated for the patient to get her second dose. For the symptoms the patient went to a walk-in clinic and the doctor did not think it was related to the vaccine. The doctor stated that the patient does not have a rash, but they seemed to think it could be a mild case of shingles, but they don&#39;t know. The outcome of event itching was recovering; outcome of event shingles was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Finally, after continuing to go downhill she asked to go to Emergency. After 10 days they were unable to diagnose and released her to a nursing facility under the guise of dementia. She had never had dementia ever. the shot scrambled her entire muscular system including voice, tongue, etc all below the neck.
