                                                Four hrs. after getting the vaccine.  My face started itching, could feel welts under the skin.  Swelling of the right side of my face started within a few hours later.  Called Drs. , He recommended taking Tylenol.  (Second Day) Next day, felt short of breath, weak, applied ice packs to my face. Third day, felt weak.  By the fourth day, swelling and itching subsided; but skin on my face felt gritty under the skin. Drove me to the doctor&#39;s office the third day.  I was short of breath walking from the car to the door to the doctor&#39;s office.  I was wearing my mask.  I saw a PA; but, she didn&#39;t tell me much of anything.  I don&#39;t think she knew what to say.

                                                Approximately 1 hour after the shot, I raised a hive on my upper lip.  It very quickly (within 2 minutes) got to its maximum size.  Not noticeably swollen to an observer, but it felt swollen, red and throbbing. It was not a serious adverse reaction.  After about an hour, it was NOT going away, but it was NOT getting worse.  I never experienced trouble breathing. The office where I had the shot is &#34;not available&#34; on Friday afternoon, and my personal physician is not in the office on Friday.  I was advised by another doctor friend to take benadryl, which I did.  While looking at the CDC website, he also advised me that (having had this reaction) I should not receive the second shot.

I then place a cold compression on the vaccine site and asked the on site physician to assets the site. The patient was place under observation for 20min and she reported feeling better and asked to leave.

I didn?t feel well that afternoon sneezing because I thought it was nothing. As the week went on I started sneezing and coughing and stopped up nose. I always end up with sinus infection when I get a cold Dec 28 I went to the doctor at doctors care and they did a covid test before the doctor would see I tested positive.  I went home and rested, no energy, felt like I was hit by a train, couldn?t breathe, sneezed a lot and hardly coughed.  January 1, I called ambulance and went to hospital, I was sick the first week of January.  I didn?t know that you should wait 90 days to get the vaccine after you?ve had Covid.  After I got the vaccination the adverse reaction, I woke up during the night with my arm hurting bad and throbbing and a very large red circle appeared on my arm 2? in diameter. The next 3 days I felt like I had covid all over again, the 4th day I woke up and felt a little better and got out of bed and started making progress each day. Now I?m not good, but I?m ok.

I applied Hydrocortisone cream USP, 2.5% to area and bandaged that night, and the next morning it appeared to be a rash.  Reapplied ointment and  rebandaged after shower every morning since then, through today 2/3/2021 It appears to be itching her and causing her to scratch until  ointment is applied. No improvement so far.

I had severe diarrhea and my bowels are still messed up- they are light yellow verging on white. I have been having migraines  and am very weak and shaky. Pain at injection site is trivial. Pain through out my body is not. I am often dizzy.

Appearance of skin is rash, welted, red, bruised and sensitive to touch in an area about 3x3 inches. OTC anti itch cream not effective. Itching became so severe, I went to my dermatologist 3 days after itching started. Diagnosed as Allergic Contact Dermatitis due to Covid 19 vaccine. Given Rx anti itch cream and told to use cold pack when it was itchy and take OTC antihistamine. Followed doctor&#39;s orders and itching finally stopped after 12 days from onset.

                                                headache; she had a mild soreness in her left arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient) via a Pfizer-sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. This pharmacist reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 10:30 AM at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in jaw and headache. Concomitant medication included Tylenol for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw. The patient (retired pharmacist) stated that she and her husband got the COVID shot on Tuesday (19Jan2021) and prior to getting the vaccine, she was suffering temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw and took Tylenol that morning. Patient just came back from urgent care and was prescribed a dose pack of prednisone to take for 5 days for the TMJ and she is concerned about taking it because she knows it can suppress the immune system and she does not want to make the vaccine less effective. She was trying to figure out if she should just tough it out and not take the steroid. She and her husband, who was on warfarin, had a mild headache after the first shot but he has sinus issues and she had the TMJ, they were not sure if the headaches were from those things or the vaccine. Patient asked if she can take Tylenol since she found out that that may not have been a good idea. She was advised to take Prednisone and she was asking if she can take it or will it affect the efficacy of the vaccine. She stated not knowing that taking Tylenol can effect the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine, she had taken Tylenol before she received her COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021 (Tuesday). Patient said her TMJ jaw pain was still a problem after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine, so she had gone to her doctor, and her doctor prescribed Prednisone, a corticosteroid. She said she was not going to take the Prednisone because she does not want the Prednisone to cause an issue with the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said she then read that studies performed on children said that children that took Tylenol did not get as good of an immune response from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said since she already took a dose of Tylenol for her TMJ jaw pain before receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, she was afraid to take any further Tylenol. Patient clarified that the Tylenol she took was the generic Equate brand, 500mg. She said she took 2 Equate brand generic Tylenol 500mg for jaw pain on Tuesday morning (19Jan2021) prior to getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she had disposed of Equate brand generic Tylenol bottle and cannot provide the UPC, Lot and Expiration Date. Reported that both her and her husband did have a headache all day long after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her husband believes his headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was not sure if her headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine or from her TMJ jaw pain. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she usually has a headache accompanying the TMJ jaw pain. Also reported that she always gets her vaccines in her left arm. Patient was surprised she and her husband did not have anything more than a headache after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said when she had the Shingles Vaccine, she could not lay on her left side for a week because her arm was so sore for 2 days, and when she had the flu shot she could not get out of bed for a day. Patient clarified she got her first dose of the Shingrix Shingles Vaccine in Nov2020, and does not plan to go and get her second Shingrix dose until the summer of 2021. Patient stated that she does not want the second dose of the Shingrix Vaccine interfering with the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient had headache on 19Jan2021, reported as mild. Patient also had a mild soreness in her left arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021, and the left arm soreness was gone in less than 24 hours. Patient further clarified that she had a headache before getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her TMJ jaw pain acts up if she eats. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she gets an excruciating headache. She said she has no headache pain at all right no. Patient expected to have kind of a worse reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine based on what other people have been saying. The events were assessed as non-serious. Outcome of the event headache and mild soreness in her left arm  was recovered in Jan2021. Patient does not think her headache pain was related to the COVID-19 Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association and drug&#39;s safety profile, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event headache cannot be totally excluded. The underlying temporomandibular joint and headache may be cofounders.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082288 same drug/reporter, similar events, different patient

Today (02/13/2021) I started rubbing and scratching on my right forearm as it increased in irritation and itching.  I looked at it and there is a long rash on it.  As I type the top of my left hand is starting to itch and top of right hand as well but no  definitive visible rash.

I went to bed around 11:30 and didn&#39;t sleep very well.  On Wed. am after going to the bathroom, I felt woozy while washing my hands.  When I thought I felt better, I made my way back to the bedroom and passed out.  I fell on my right side, bruising the right side of my face, my right hip and my right thigh.  I apparently had my left hand under me when I fell because I broke the knuckle under the pinkie of my left hand.

Day by day I noticed an incease of clusters of blisters forming below the first site.  They then circled from front to back halfway up my lower leg.  Large whelpy itchy places continued to form on my upper forearms and back of right arm elbow.  Then the same effects started on my left leg on the back side between my knee and ankle.  I have now a large circular area on my lower back at the waistline with solid itchy hard bumps that has increased in size and discomfort.  I have red itchy blisters on both my left and right uper wrists.  I am noticing small clrcular bumps on my right and left forehead.

Doctor diagnosed infection as cellulitis,  and prescribed doxycycline 100mg for 5 days. Because of the underlying primary immune deficiency,  this will be a difficult adverse event to overcome. First noticed on February 25, 2021. Covid-19 vaccine was administered on Monday February 22nd 2021.

                                                4 days after 2nd dose:  hives all over my body and swelling of face and eyes.  Called Telemedicine at Urgent Care Huntsville Hospital.  Was given instructions to take 40 mg of Prednisone first day and taper off, 2-3 doses of antihistamine and Hydrocortisone on welts.  Needed to go to ER for IV if face swelling did not go down.  Today (second day after call):  Face swelling is down but hives are possibly worse (large welts over large portion of body plus on hands and feet and chin)

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 26Jan2021 at 14:19 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no previous immunizations. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date. Medical history included allergic to penicillin, bladder infection, in the middle of her chest she had the pain cling through her back, and thyroid getting lazy and does not work. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid getting lazy and does not work, vitamins, and sulfa drugs for bladder infection. It was reported that after getting the first dose of the vaccine the patient noticed she had pustules across her back on an unspecified date. The patient stated she &#34;got this rash from the tips of fingers, even the palm of my hands and it starts right under the neck and goes across my breast, on my belly, on my back and both arms and is now halfway down my shin bone.&#34; On an unspecified date in Jan2021, she noticed this the afternoon of her vaccine around 7:00 when she saw two splotches on her stomach and it kept spreading. Sunday morning she went to Quick Care and yesterday went to her regular doctor. Her doctor gave her prednisone to take 10 mg 4 times a day, and hydroxyzine 10 mg for itching. In her throat she was getting hoarse on an unspecified date and was keeping a water bottle on her desk to keep hydrated. She stated she read on (website) that a rash can be a symptom of the vaccine. The caller asked, &#34;if the pustules burst will this cause anyone to get Covid 19? Is this a possible side effect of the vaccine? How long will this last? Is it okay to get my second shot with this reaction? Is there anything I should be taking to make it go away?&#34; It was further reported that patient received paperwork to call if there was any type of reaction. The patient mentioned she has a rash that was all over her body on 28Jan2021. It was on the top of her hands, in the palm of her hands, on her arms, back, under her breast, on her chest, on her stomach, on her bottom end, it was going down her legs and to her knees at this point. The patient initially stated she noticed the rash on Friday (29Jan2021), she later stated it was Thursday 28Jan2021 when the rash first started. She stated she first noticed splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist on an unspecified date in Jan2021. At first when looking at it she did not think too much about it. Later in the call she further clarified and stated it was possible she noticed these splotches the same day in the evening on the day she got the vaccine. She was not sure. If it was not the same day it was the next day. Friday (29Jan2021), she started to get as initially stated bumps, but later clarified rash under skin and it really proceeded from there. Additionally, it was reported that the rash continued to spread throughout her whole body. It was down to her shin now. Her whole upper body was horrible. She has some across her back. There are pustules on them like a pimple. It was like water in it ready to break. Sunday she went to a (clinic name) to get it looked at. She went Sunday 31Jan2021. She was given an intravenous (IV) and three needles were placed in it. She knows one was a steroid, she does not know what the other two were for, but she thinks one was probably for itching. The patient also confirmed she also experienced itching with the rash on 28Jan2021. It started the same day she noticed the rash. The patient stated it was like a full blown case now. The itching was with the rash on 28Jan2021. The itching and rash has continued to go down her body. It was on her buttocks now. It was hard to sit. It was in private up between her legs and stuff. Her body was almost 80 % full and covered with this stuff. She saw her regular doctor yesterday. The doctor at (clinic name) thought this reaction may have been an allergic reaction to a Sulfa drug she was taking for a bladder infection coincidentally at the same time, but she does not believe this was the case. Stated she had taken that sulfa drug before previously. She does not have the name of the drug to provide of the sulfa drug. She does not have it with her. No blood work was done. She was just looked at. They saw what was going on. The patient also mentioned she went on the internet to do research. She saw on Pfizer page three pictures that resembled what she had going on. It was also reported that the two splotches on right hand side started about 7&#39;clock in the evening. At first did not think anything of it. Thought it was possibly a bug bite at first. Additionally, it was reported that patient went to see a doctor. She was already going to the doctor for a bone density scan and she showed the doctor what was going on at the same time. Her primary doctor thought this was due to the COVID 19 Vaccine. At end of call, patient questioned &#34;if the pustules across upper back and behind neck, will that cause anyone to get COVID 19? Side effect?&#34; The patient had no emergency visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of itching with the rash, rash that is all over her body, and two splotches on right hand side.

                                                Within 8 hours of the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle weakness (could not lift arms above head; could not stand from sitting position without pain). During night, could not turn over in bed without pain. This lasted for 3-4 days. Treated with Advil. Next symptoms were joint pains and stiffness and back pains, which also lasted about a week. Treated with Aleve and hot/cold compresses. Final symptoms are severe swelling and stiffness of hands and fingers, with cracked, peeling skin. I have had this for about a week now and it is not improving. Cannot grasp anything with either hand. Middle and index fingers on both hands useless.

Later that evening my feet were also itching. All night long and into Tuesday but the itching also included my underarms, chest, and upper thighs. Finally on Tuesday I started taking 2 Benedryl tablets every 6 hours, however at 4 hours the itching came back but seemed to be only on the upper body. It is now a little over 72 hours since my shot and I&#39;m still suffering the itching, but not quite as bad with Benedryl. Since I didn&#39;t see this on the list of possible side effects, I thought you should know.

Called Covid line and spoke to a RN who recommended that I take Ibuprofen  and  not to take an antihistamine,  and  to contact my doctor in the morning.  Also to go to the ER if symptoms got worse I took Ibuprofen every 4 hours  over night and called  my  primary  care physician in the morning.  He sent me to the Urgent Care center since  the rash had persisted .  The Urgent Care  physician prescribed  Prednisone  and  Benadryl.  I  am taking antihistamines  and Ibuprofen  for relief of rash and  itching.  I will follow-up  doctor on Monday.

When I got up to take a Motrin I was disorientated. Did not know where I was. .   Next day experienced several sudden feelings a syncopye.  Lasting a few seconds. Had to grab on to something due to a feeling that I was going to fall. It lasted just a quick second or two.  Happened several times that day.  Like what I would think a TIA would feel like.  Arm was just slightly tender and stinging the first day,.  In the night it was aching and hot up into my neck.  The next morning it was fine again. Just tender and a little stiff.  I attempted to report this on line at instructed on forms given me when I left the site. however the CODE that was to be sent to my phone never came. I then entered the wed site and attempted to report it there. .  Finally I called my primary Dr and he has instructed me to report this to the person giving the second injection.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, lot number: EL9262 and expiry date: 31May2021) via Intramuscularly to left arm on 22Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient medical history included bladder infection, blood pressure, she has some old age stuff like blood pressure, and she had Thyroid removed and takes a thyroid pill every day and she tends toward GERD. Concomitant medications included she does take other medications, but they are not relevant. Patient previously took Shingles shot for Shingles (Had the first of the Shingles shot but it was before that. She is due for the second one but she is putting it off for the COVID second dose). Patient reported that she got the COVID vaccine and was really excited because seemingly, she had no side effects. The shot did not hurt. Ten days after she go the shot, she got really hot at night and really strong muscle and joint aches on 31Jan2021. She was up almost all night. It just kept waking her up. So, she took something, an Ibuprofen thing to reduce fever and pain. The next night she took one proactively and did not have pain. The third night, she had it again but it was a headache all night and she was hot on 02Feb2021. It only seemed to happen at night. She felt like it was from the vaccine. She was not worried she had COVID. She had no breathing problems and did not feel like she was going to pass out. They said she should wait 48 hours and take a test to see if she had COVID. She did and it was negative. She does not feel any negativity toward the vaccine. She went in for a bladder infection and it was from a doctor&#39;s appointment that she got information and they told her she could go ahead and get it. Since she got the vaccine, she got white bump in the vicinity of the vaccine like a while mole, and another in the vicinity of the area as well. It does not itch or hurt. She noticed it about a week after the shot. She does not know the date. She was still on medication for a bladder infection but it would not have done anything. When she had reaction to the vaccine, it was already 10 days after she got the shot. She had asked them at Kaiser, and they think it was unrelated to any other medication. Outcome of event fever was recovered on 01Feb2021, for white bump near injection site was not recovered and recovering for all other events.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

After the second she got very cold and felt miserable like her legs had weights on them- this only lasted 1-2 days. Then two weeks later she got a ring around the injection site- and developed intense itching, burning, and erythema and warmth at the site and axillary lymph node swelling.  The muscle on her arm were tender and swollen as well. The lymphadenopathy, and arm pain and swelling lasted for over a month.   Pfizer :  Lot: 12831/8/21 Lot 9261 1/25/21

                                                She had welts and little red spots all over her back a couple of hours after the second dose of vaccine. She got rubbed down with alcohol and cortisone cream that night. Today, the back welts went away but the red spots are still there. After checking her again around 8:30 p.m. because she complained of her left hand itching, I noticed more welts up her left arms and more came back on her middle and upper back. She was then rubbed down again and given an ibupropean. I am unsure of this side effect because it was not mentioned on any cdc website, so therefore I will be calling her physician to do a checkup. If there is any other information we need to know on how to treat the outbreaks please send email.

A 76-year-old female patient received  the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9266, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 23Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history included stomach problem and bleeding problems in her stomach. There were no concomitant medications. The patient said that absolutely everything was okay until she went to get the shot, and was even okay the evening of the shot, then it went down hill from there. She said nothing she has that is related to the pain in her arm, or that she feels she should provide. She did not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient stated that the injection area was a little sore and the area became bigger and bigger by Wednesday (24Feb2021). She woke up on Thursday (25Feb2021) and her elbow and shoulder was in pain, described as a dull pain. The patient stated she has a stomach problem where she can&#39;t take medicine. She started treating her pain with aspirin cream with Lidocaine. She said that its kind of worked, it didn&#39;t take it away, but more manageable. Now it&#39;s been 6 days later (01Mar2021), it was reported a deep deep pain in the point she can&#39;t sleep at night. She can&#39;t position her arm in a way that is not painful. It was getting unbearable. It transferred from shoulder to her neck on Friday (26Feb2021). It got worse Thursday evening and has been the same since. Patient said, &#34;I am not going to get the second shot if this pain does not go away or if I am going to experience this again.&#34; The patient was calling about a possible side effect and was wondering if anyone else had it and does it go away. She was suffering, she wanted to know if the pain she is in, that she is still experiencing will go away. She said that she had a deep muscle ache pain to the point she can&#39;t sleep at night.  Patient stated that her pain began as soreness at injection site that started Wednesday and then it just got worse and worse and became deeper and deeper just between her shoulder and elbow, a deep constant achy pain. During the day when she is using her arm she can kind of forget the pain, but at night there was no comfortable position she can put her arm in without pain, so she has not been sleeping the last 3-4 nights, she can&#39;t sleep, she was miserable. She said she would rather get COVID than this, it was ridiculous. As she has bleeding problems in her stomach, she can&#39;t take anything to treat the pain, so she was trying to use lidocaine on her arm, which did at first give some relief but no longer works. She said that the only number listed on the bottle was next to &#34;EXP date, LOT: 19C506, EXP: Mar2021 (as reported).&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                She got the vaccine, when she came home she started feeling the fatigue that she felt after the 1st vaccine.  She then started feeling very cold, laid down and watched TV.  She then had chills all night and did not sleep well due to that.  When she got up on Tuesday the chills were gone but had a slight headache off and on throughout the day, her temp was 97.2.  Throughout the day she would get warm spurts/hot flashes, as well as fatigue.  She did sleep that night, and when she got up yesterday morning still had the hot flashes and it was 94.2, and took it twice due to it being so low.  She was like that with fatigue and not able to sit up.  She went to bed, took some Tylenol and rested.  The heat feeling it started going away.  Around dinner time she felt more like herself, the headache was gone and her temp was 97.  She was doing pretty good, and the last thing she had was she felt on her cheeks and noticed a rash on her face, like a prickly heat type rash.  Before she went to bed she put Neosporin on it, and when she got up this morning it was almost gone but still has a tiny few bumps.   The arm itself did not hurt at all.    Feels that it is a stressful situation as to where to get the vaccine and having to travel to get it as it&#39;s not available in locations closer to their homes.  The people at the pharmacy were great, but had to travel and if it wasn&#39;t for her daughter she would probably not have her shot.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question. The reporter considered the events fatigue aggravated serious and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as medically significant. The outcome of the events fatigue aggravated recovering; as for the events blood pressure raised, &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39;, lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired were not recovered; while the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 01Apr2021 (reported as 2 days after). The outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events fatigue aggravated and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as serious (IME).Based on the plausible temporal association and product safety profile, the reported events are possibly related to the vaccine BNT162B2. administration. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

                                                March 10, 2021 I received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and the following day I experienced the predicted side effects of fever, chills, headache, fatigue and lack of appetite, which were all mild and I took Tylenol for the fever. The following day I was fine. After approximately two weeks I noticed there were subtle and unusual changes regarding my appetite, energy level an itchy rash on my back and a runny nose.  I didn?t pay much attention to any of these as they weren?t debilitating symptoms, but very unique for me. Then I realized I needed to pay more attention to these symptoms as they were getting more significant, except for the fact I didn?t have a fever.  Also my ears felt they were blocked.  I thought perhaps because of the feeling of blocked ears I may be getting a sinus infection although I haven?t had one in years. I called the doctor?s office on April 5th and I was told to go to the Urgent Care, which I did.  I was examined and given a prescription for a nasal spray, antihistamine and an antibiotic in case symptoms became more severe. It was also suggested that I may want to have a Covid test. I?m not used to taking any medications except for Trazodone, and was reluctant to take what was prescribed because if it was indeed a sinus infection it wasn?t in line with any I?d had years ago. I used the nasal spray for a few days and also the antihistamine. The headache got worse, and would move from one area of my head to another and also down the side of my face and neck. Tylenol didn?t help and Ibuprofen only helped now and again. The headache had a mind of its own. Warm compresses did help. I was in contact through the portal for recommendations from the medical staff.

A 76-year-old non-pregnant female patient received second dose on BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, Lot number EN6204) on 12Mar2021 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Diabetes Type II controlled, hypoparathyroidism and bi-polar. Concomitant medications included CALCITRIOL (calcitrol [calcitriol]), CALCIUM (calcium), AMITRIPTYLINE HYDROCHLORIDE (amitriptyline) and LITHIUM (lithium) (medication in two weeks). No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no allergies. The patient previously took first dose of BNT62b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, Lot number EN6200) for on 19Feb2021 10:30 via an unspecified route of administration in left arm at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 Immunization. It was reported that, on 07Apr2021 adverse reaction to Pfizer covid vaccine: Body rash, itching. Started 1-2 days following 2nd Pfizer Covid vaccine on 12Mar2021. Rash has persisted reappearing over most of body, legs, hips, stomach, back, rib cage, feet hands, etc. Seems to flare up in areas, subsided then reappeared in another area. OTC antihistamine was not effective. Rash was continued nearly 4 weeks following 2nd vaccine and does not appear to be going away. Very distressing as rash persists. Patient has been to her primary care doctor and a dermatologist who had no idea what was causing her acute skin reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. Patient was quickly approaching two months with a violent skin reaction, huge patches of bright red and many areas swollen. Patient&#39;s skin continued to erupt from head to toe, both painful and itching. When red patches broke out then slowly recede more red patches broke out. Patient has never had such an allergic reaction and it showed no sign of going away, in fact it seems to be worsening. There was no information available as to what patient have been poisoned with, was there an antidote, would it ever go away. Every day patient awakened with more spread and violent eruptions all over her body. Patient said you need to respond, and you need to tell her what was wrong. This was no less than frightening and depressing. A high dose of antihistamine and topical steroid did nothing to control her acute reaction. The patient was treated with antihistamines and topical steroids. No COVID prior vaccination. Patient has not tested COVID post vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                It was vaccine I noticed my arm turning red at the injection site and it was hard. It started to travel up and down my arm as one large area. It was itchy and warm. It got larger over the course of two days and then it started to recede. I iced it and it helped a little. Benadryl did not help. I got the second shot in the same arm and it did not spread but it did get a little red. I also got the shingles about two weeks out from the vaccine. I have had the shingles before and I knew what it was so I took the medication and it cleared up quickly.

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0773) via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 04May2021 11:00 at age of 76-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Doctor wanted her to get it. Caller said that her doctor told her she wouldn&#39;t make it if she got COVID. Her heart couldn&#39;t pump very well and was very weak. Other medical history included a lot of allergies (They made her sit in a recliner for 30 minutes) and thyroid disorder. No further details provided by the caller regarding her thyroid condition. Caller did not think there were any other medical conditions that she had that would be relevant as she was pretty darn healthy. Family medical history relevant to AE: Not that she knows of. Daughter had the shot and was sick for 2 days. She had the Pfizer. No vaccine administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid from an unspecified start date for 20 years and ongoing. Got the shot 04May2021. Dry heaves on 04May2021: Didn&#39;t really throw up, but she had them all day. Still has them but not as bad. Nausea/ nauseated on 04May2021: It was actually kind of steady. Caller was able to eat and drink, not that she wanted to. She did not know what to do with herself. She was eating and drinking. She took TUMS [CALCIUM CARBONATE] and always had a cast iron stomach. Skin is so itchy on 04May2021: Skin started itching right away, that evening that she got the shot. She even used a back scratcher. It was all over and still felt the same. Treatment: Had taken diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) maybe once or twice and when she went to bed. She didn&#39;t take it steady. She did not take the TUMS steady either. Yesterday, she felt better, and currently felt worse again. Had a little more energy and was feeling good. Sore arm on 04May2021: Was sore right away, after the shot. It was still sore but it was better. It was not red or anything. Treatment: Took 1/4 of a paracetamol (TYLENOL), 325mg, so it was 12 or something. Weak on an unspecified date and did not feel well on an unspecified date. Her blood pressure was good and she has no fever. She also stated her stomach was upset 24/7. She didn&#39;t like the way she was feeling after the first dose (May2021). She just wish this would go away. She didn&#39;t feel good. 10 days was a long time to have a reaction. Tests: Recently had blood work and everything was normal. Even her thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) which she got tested for every month is fine. It was off but currently was regular. The event did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Her next shot was on 25May2021 and was scared to get it. The patient asked what would happen if she did get the second dose. The outcome of events &#34;skin so itchy&#34;, &#34;nauseated/nausea&#34; was not recovered, of events &#34;dry heaves&#34;, &#34;sore arm&#34; was recovering, of &#34;TSH is off&#34; was recovered, of other events was unknown.

A week later from vaccination on Feb2021, she then began to notice her eyes started getting swollen couple days after, she then felt like her eyes felt like they were closing, then she saw her whole face was swelling, it looks like she had Chipmunk cheeks. She went to the doctor hoping it would go away, she was prescribed Benadryl and a decongestant as treatment. She takes Benadryl three times a day and the decongestant in the morning and her face is still swollen. It started with the eyes and the bag under the eyes, that was the first thing she noticed. She laughs and though she initially had an eye infection. She just wants to know if there is any other reports of this happening, or how to get rid of it, this has been there since she got her second dose on the 06Feb2021 since like 10Feb2021. After the second vaccine on 06Feb2021 around that time an hour later, she was on the way home and started getting hungry, she thought that was a symptom as well as her arm hurt a bit. She was starving till Monday got up 2AM, 6AM ate all day Sunday and Monday ate all day, as reported &#34;all she knows is she was craving a crab sandwich.&#34; Her Eyes swelling started a couple days later and the Face swelling was either the second week or same time, she just recalls looking at the eyes.

The Appointment with the doctor was yesterday (15Mar2021), they prescribed Benadryl. Patient clarified that she was not Prescribed Zyrtec, it was a decongestant but she does not know the name of it. The Druggist however told her she could take another medication also. As reported &#34;The eye swelling and face swelling, at the moment she look like she been drunk, her face is plentiful, she is still swollen, her lids are not bad, but it is ongoing, it has gotten worse because prior she didnt even know it was there and its showing more now.

                                                About a couple weeks after my second dose of the vaccine I started to have extreme itching on my scalp. I did not see anything at first and then another week later I saw a red irritated area. Then a couple days later I saw a white plaque like material. So then I saw a dermatologist and he said it was plaque psoriasis. He injected some medication behind my left ear (I do not remember what) and gave me a medicated shampoo which was a prescription. It is called ketoconazole shampoo 2% for topical application only. I continue to use it because the plaque is still there, the itching continues as well. I itch a lot during the night and I will do a follow up with a DR.

After her infusion, both of her eyes were swollen, the right eye was sensitive to light, her eyes kept fluttering while looking up or bending over, and the right side of the face was swollen. This was constantly happening but is now getting better but not completely over. She mentioned that she talked to several doctors and they think that Remicade, since it lowers the immune system and decreases white blood cell count and the vaccine increases the white blood count, it has interfered with the signals with her eyes. She was also hospitalized from 29May2021 to 2Jun2021 for cellulitis and was given some antibiotics and steroids which she thinks helped with her symptoms. She was asking if this has been reported and if this will happen again on 24Jun2021 for her next Remicade infusion. she was taking Remicade before giving her the vaccine. she had concern, would the vaccine affect the Remicade and cause these reactions.

It interfered with her activities, and she didn&#39;t feel comfortable driving because she didn&#39;t know when it would hit her. Every time she talked to a doctor, they acted like she is crazy. It only seemed after the Remicade that this started happening, and now she was due for another Remicade infusion on 24Jun2021. She had some other health issues earlier this month and was put on antibiotics. The antibiotics seemed to help the eye it is not completely gone but better. She was wondering now if she should get the Remicade on 24Jun2021. She had skin cancer, and when they removed it, she got cellulitis in her leg. She was in the hospital for 3 days. She asked the doctor there and they brushed her off. The last day before she came home the nurse came in and wanted to know if she had her shot. She asked the nurse the same question about the vaccine and Remicade, and the nurse said now they ask people before they get the shot if they are on Remicade. The nurse didn&#39;t have anyone that said yes. It was seeming like there is some kind of problem with Remicade and the vaccine. That is why she was a little bit concerned about having it again.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL3246, via an unspecified route of administration to left arm from 02Jan2021 to 02Jan2021 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included spinal surgery and surgical wound, a 7 inch scar along her back/she had spinal surgery and has a 7 inch scar, she had no problems.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported a rash that developed after receiving vaccine on 02Jan2021.  On 03Jan2021, her rash occurred on a recent surgical wound, a 7 inch scar along her back.  The rash also developed on the back crease of her legs and neck.  She has been managing her symptoms with Benadryl. The patient was asking is others has reported this side effect. The patient is also asking if she can get the second dose of the vaccine. Her surgeon suggested perhaps not receiving second vaccine. It was further reported as, &#34;got Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on Saturday. Next day had a severe rash that got worse. Saw her general practitioner this morning and got steroids to help with itching. No further details provided, wants to know if she should forgo the second shot. The patient stated she was fortunate to get the Pfizer vaccine, later clarified as Pfizer COVID vaccine, Saturday in the early am, then on Sunday, developed a rash over part of her body, she can control with Benadryl, the itching, but the weird part, is a month ago, she had spinal surgery and has a 7 inch scar, she had no problems, like no reaction to glue, but the rash is concentrated down both sides of the scar. She had an appointment with her surgeon today, and showed it to him, since she thought it was unusual, and he said she may not want to take the second dose, it was not a terrible rash all over her body, mainly concentrated to the area of her back, and it is like a little bit on the back of her neck, not even anything she would notice, but it is there. The patient stated she can&#39;t get through to the Health Department, and she has a card to say to have the second dose on 23Jan2020, but she can&#39;t get through. States thanks so much, this is a miracle event and in a year&#39;s time, even if she did get a rash. The rash is a little more pronounced, but she has been rubbing it trying to not scratch, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be spreading any at all. States she is healthy. Seeking more information about getting the second dose after experiencing a rash. The outcome of the event was unknown.

A few minutes later her lip from the center left was also tingling, and then spread to entire left side of her body from head to feet, like her left side feel asleep that tingly feeling and numbness.  Began to be worried, called 9-1-1 and the EMT reassured her that she was not having a stroke, and told her that they had heard of it before.  Still today, Monday 1/25/21, particularly in her left hand which she is not able to use very much.  Did take Ibuprofen but nothing else.

Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number was either: EL1283, CL1283, or LL1283) on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took pneumonia shot on an unknown date and flu shot in Oct2020 for immunization. Patient got the first dose of the vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 in the morning. On 11Jan2021 her arm felt tender where the needle went in.On 12Jan2021 late afternoon, she started getting hissing in her ear that was still there and had not gone away at all and she also had a constant humming in her right ear. By 13Jan2021, she still had the humming.  She saw an ENT on 13Jan2021 and doctor didn&#39;t know if it was correlated to the vaccine or not; doctor took some wax out of her ear and she seemed to get relief from the hissing for about 15 minutes but about 15-20 minutes later the hissing/ humming continued. On 14Jan2021, woke up with complete deafness in right ear. Immediately called ENT doctor and did a hearing test. Patient could not hear and they confirmed she had sudden hearing loss in her right ear on 14Jan2021, she had nothing in her right ear (as reported). They put her on 40 mg a day of Prednisone (20mg tablets) and so far, prednisone hadn&#39;t done anything: originally taking prednisone 40mg for four days and was taking two a day;  on 16Jan2021 when she was getting no relief and couldn&#39;t sleep due to the humming in her ear, she called doctor and was advised to take the 40mg together in the morning, she will take 40mg a day. On 19Jan2021 she took 20mg for four days and then decreased by half again. She was also advised by doctor to take 25mg Benadryl (UPC: 30048284 Lot: SPS023 Exp: Jun2022) at night. They are scheduling her for an MRI in Jan2021.Patient was also scheduled for the second dose on 01Feb2021 and will be on the prednisone until 26Jan2021; she would like to know whether the prednisone will diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine. She also asked  if there was a certain amount of time she should wait to restart in case the doctor decided she should not get the second dose; she also wanted to know if she should wait on the second vaccine and maybe start over in two months.She was concerned and wanted to know if she should proceed with the second shot. The patient underwent blood work on an unspecified date to see if she can receive contrast for an MRI. She never had problem with MRI contrast before. Final outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

I have asked her to consider premedicating with 50 mg diphenhydramine 1 hr prior to dose 2 of vaccine.  I have also asked her to register with v-safe and have sent her the information in case she did not keep the paperwork.     Pt then saw PCP several days later who suggested she not receive second vaccination

She did not get any sleep on 19Jan2021 and was itching. She called the doctor&#39;s office to see if they could help her and they said they couldn&#39;t and told her she needed to contact the health department &#34;or something.&#34; They aren&#39;t familiar with the vaccine and does not want to do anything that would put them in a legal situation. She stated she has an appointment on 08Feb for her next dose and she doesn&#39;t know if she can go through this again. She asked what can she do about this reaction. She started to get itching and &#34;stuff&#34; that was not bad until last night (unspecified date). She stated that it was like she had hives all over and itching out of control. She did not get any sleep and is still itching out of control. She wanted to know if she goes back to hospital if they will be able to do anything for her. It was her first shot and is scheduled for her second one on 08Feb2021. She was wondering will she have to go through all of this again.

She stated that she had thought it was an allergic reaction to a fabric softener that she changed to. No treatment was given in response to the events. She has stated that she takes other medications that she has never had a reaction to. She does not think that they were related to this. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

The next day on Saturday I had more red spots but not quite the same as around my ankles.  More up my legs to my knees.  This morning (Sunday Feb 7th) I now have more spots on my arms.  These spots are not like the dark reds ones around my ankles.  I also have a spot on my face.  I went to the Urgent Care in my area and the opinion of the doctor on call these spots may be related to my vaccine even though it has been 2 and 1/2 weeks since I had the covid  vaccine.  Up until this eposide I have not had any reaction to the vaccine.  They suggested  I contact you with this information.  I was given a Medrol Dose Pak for the rash.  The doctor was not sure the vaccine was the cause of my rash. I would appreciate if someone would contact me and let me know if I should not take my next vaccine which is scheduled for Feb.10 at 9:45 AM.

It&#39;s become difficult to move her arm and had worsened since the injection.  She wanted to know if this type of experience had been reported and if she should receive the second vaccination scheduled for the 30th. The patient stated that she had a hard time lift my arm in changing clothes and she can&#39;t her shoulder. After one week later about almost 1 week later she felt in her arm, around that shot she had the injection, started itchy started to feel itchy and she was afraid maybe infection, dead skin, maybe infection or something.

The rash exhibited a classic pine tree pattern with an initial herald patch under the left arm. The rash is consistent with a diagnosis of Pityriasis Rosea. Over the last 5 days, the rash has begun to fade on the trunk and back and the herald patch has disappeared during the laast 24 hours. A low level if itching has been treated with 25 mg. of Benadryl taken at bedtime.

Later in the day, I felt  fatigued, and aching, and my left arm started to get very tight and sore. The next day I felt the same, and my lymph nodes under both my arms began to swell and hurt and my rectum began to have severe pain. Still had  diarrhea.  By day 5 my left arm ,at the site of the injection ,started to swell, get very hot ,and a large, bright red welt appeared which  almost reached my elbow and went across the width of my upper arm..  I called my doctor and went to see her on the next day because it had gotten worse.  She thought it was a local reaction and recommended ice, tylenol and benedryl. Again, as with the first shot, I am not sure if this is an allergic reaction or not., but thought I would report it.

Over a period of several days, these welts spread to my back and were angry, red and painful.  Since then, they have blistered. I went to a walk-in clinic because my primary care physician clinic was closed due to lack of power.  At the walk-in clinic, I was diagnosed as having shingles.  I had the shingles vaccine in 2014. I am now taking Acyclovir 800 mg five times per day. I am also taking L-Lysine with meals and Oxycodone-acetaminophen for pain.

The rash starts as fine red spots that later become inflamed and join to form large irregular patches that could be a 2 or 3 inches in diameter. Televisited primary care physician who prescribed Zyrtec twice a day and Caladryl topical lotion and referred me to a dermatologist who prescribed 0.05% Clobetasol Propionate Ointment and Benadryl as needed. The rash persisted and became worse after the 2nd shot 21 days later, but was fading slightly and was less itchy and burny just before the 2nd shot.  Will report 2nd shot events separately later.

Thursday and Friday she was fine. However, Saturday morning (30Jan2021) when she woke up she had two red welts, almost like hives on her body and a little bit of itching. Then, the wee hours of yesterday morning (Sunday morning) both arms near her wrist area only were itching like crazy. She was calling to see if it would be okay to take Benadryl for the itching. No one she has called yet has been able to answer her question. She tried contacting the hospital where she got the vaccine. The patient further reported that she noticed the two red welts like hives on her body on Saturday in the morning (30Jan2021) when she woke up, exact time not specified. This has gone away. It went away sometime yesterday (31Jan2021). These were also itchy. She noticed the inside of her arm by the wrist area in the early morning hours yesterday were extremely itchy. She thought for sure she would wake up with red welts but there wasn&#39;t any. Her arms are fine. Now, her back was itchy. Her back now was the only thing now really itching. She placed Cortisone cream on her back and it helped. Her back was still a little itchy, but not as bad. The patient scheduled for her second dose on 18Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of itching/both arms near her wrist area only were itching like crazy/her back was itchy. On 31Jan2021, the patient recovered from &#34;two red welts, almost like hives on her body&#34; and was recovering from itching.

                                                Pain; Burning sensation; Hives; Injection site soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: el1284 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 19Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lymphoma from May2020, had chemotherapy for lymphoma from Jun2020 to 08Oct2020, shingles, knee replacement from 2008 and allergic to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she thinks she was having side effects from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine she got 19Jan2021, tomorrow 02Feb2020 was two weeks from when she got it. Patient didn&#39;t have any side effects to start with, just soreness to the injection site on Jan2021. She says last Wednesday, 27Jan2021, she noticed she had hives, not a rash, on her chest on the left side that are kind of on her breast, the top of her breast, which now spread under her arm up to her shoulder area and back. There was pain along with it, a burning sensation starting last night on 31Jan2021 in the inside area. Since she got her injection on her left side, she doesn&#39;t know if this could be a reaction to the injection or not. She had shingles several years ago, this was acting like that, and it looked like one of the side effects listed is lymphadenopathy, which she looked up information about that, but she doesn&#39;t know what it was, she doesn&#39;t know what else to blame it on. Patient hasn&#39;t seen her doctor yet for hives, and has not treated the hives. She got the OK from the nurse who said she didn&#39;t see a reason for her not to get the vaccine since she was coming off chemo several months prior. Patient was considered to be in remission right now, and she has an appointment next week with her oncologist for follow up. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL8982), intramuscular on the left arm at the age of 77 years, on 27Jan2021 11:30 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization and cefuroxime axetil (CEFUROXIME AXETIL), oral from 25Jan2021 to Jan2021 at 250 mg, 2x/day (250mg tablet, one tablet twice a day by mouth ) for urinary tract infection. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed many years ago, ongoing rash because she was still having a problem in her pubic area with a rash that is going on, states this is from the urinary tract infection and urinary tract infection from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. When she got the vaccine she was on an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection (UTI), she is asking if there would be any correlation or any interaction between the antibiotic and the vaccine. The antibiotic was something she has taken quite often and has taken it before called cefuroxime axetil. Concomitant medication included insulin (INSULIN) for diabetes. The patient developed itching throughout her body, like hives that started late Friday (29Jan2021) and she will get areas on her hands and arms. This morning it was on her legs where it was red and warm. She reported it goes away and comes back. This morning the hives were fairly heavy and now that she has gotten up and cooled her body down, the hives were subsiding. The outcome of the events was recovering.

She received the shot on 25Jan2021, says she only had the sore arm on 26Jan and it was only at the site of the injection like a regular shot, and then last Monday evening 1Feb2021, she started getting headache and the next morning she felt miserable.

She was not feeling like driving or riding in the car to get it. Or they suggested that she quarantine for 10 days which is what she has been doing.

The severe Itchy burny skin rash that continued 21 days after the first shot became more severe after the second shot with a large area forming and growing across the whole lower back.  It had dimensions of about 12 inches across and 8 inches high that became solid red.  A spotted rash formed on the sides of the breasts and upper back.  Topical steroids were used.  To not interfere with the immunization , the dermatologist waited 21 days before prescribing  a programmed decreasing regiment of Prednesone tablets. The rash subsided 6 weeks after the second vaccination.

A 77-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included weakened immune system because of the alcohol allergy (started while 19), and aches and pains. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (expiry date May2021) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 77 years old last 22Jan2021 administered on the upper righthand arm later clarified as upper right arm; and she was still going through that systemic reaction when she had her first COVID vaccine. The patient asked on regarding how effective the vaccine was related to receiving steroid therapy. Patient was advised by doctor to go to urgent care to have a covid test to see if she and husband were exposed to covid before the vaccines kicked in.  Patient stated that on an unspecified date in 2021, she still didn&#39;t feel well and was running one heck of a temperature (increased). Patient reported she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. She filled out the forms. Patient felt like she should be put in the hospital. She has a horrific allergy to alcohol. Each time she receives an injection it gets worse. She knew when she received the second dose that the third ingredient was alcohol. She thought about was worse, the virus or the reaction. Within a minute of taking the vaccine she had a reaction. She reported it at the site and was watched for a half hour. Her question was &#34;because she took prednisone immediately after getting the vaccine does that negate the shot?&#34; She was not asked the name of the steroid that she took. She was taking prednisone 20mg, 2 tablets as soon as she gets a shot then 2 daily Monday-Friday. It was still going through her system and it was reeking havoc on her. If she goes to the hospital they will give her Benadryl and monitor her. Patient stated that on 08Feb2021, she had an allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine. Patient stated that she had both COVID shots and had adverse reactions and took some medicine for the adverse reaction and now the patient was concerned it might mess with the shot, it might not work for her as it should. She knew that this was going to be a long process and she knew her allergies were rare, but they were there. She is allergic to isopropyl alcohol, even if it is in shampoos or liquid soaps, she gets reactions. She had her first COVID vaccine and she had her own hospital cleanser that she has with her at all times and she used it which was not a problem. For her second COVID vaccine, the nurse was naming the 3 ingredients that were in the COVID vaccine and asked if she was allergic to any. She said this last shot had alcohol in it, she sat with her husband next to her, and thought which was worse: getting COVID, the cases in the city are high, or having a reaction to the alcohol. She chose the latter. When it went into her arm she immediately knew she was getting a reaction. She had steroids with her just in case this happened. Each time the reaction happens, it gets worse. She said she sat for half an hour and has been on steroids until last Friday. She was supposed to be on them for days. On Friday, she was wondering if taking the steroids negated the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine and that&#39;s why she called in. She knew that this was rare and it was not something that the company going to say that the company know how to fix it. Patient worked in the health unit of a university as a hiring and firing people person. So, she was around it, but she was not a doctor or a nurse. So, she guessed the answer was no. Last week she received her second COVID vaccine. She said, she has got to get rid of 5 pounds, but it&#39;s harder to do that when you&#39;re older. She experienced the reaction from the isopropyl alcohol within her second dose of the COVID vaccine last week, 08Feb2021. She said she was still going through it and will for a while. When asked for the outcome, she said she couldn&#39;t answer that honestly. She said she didn&#39;t feel good (2021). Period. She knew that when she goes through this it takes, each time, an extra 4 to 5 days to get over it. When she got up this morning, she didn&#39;t feel good. Her husband asked if she wanted to go sailing, and she said not in 30 degree weather, but for her to say no to sailing, her husband knew she didn&#39;t feel well. She couldn&#39;t say worse, but she can say she didn&#39;t know how long it was going to be, which was scaring her. By doing what she did, if that negated the COVID vaccine, then lets go from there. That&#39;s what she was afraid of. When she tells people she is allergic to alcohol, and when it happens, they look at her like &#34;nobody is allergic to alcohol.&#34; She is 77 and has the aches and pains of a 77 year old, which she hates. But she doesn&#39;t think there are related medical conditions to what she experienced. This (allergy to alcohol) started when she was 19 and it has gotten progressively worse. So she tries to be careful. She says this was her, not dumb, but her decision that she made and now she is concerned.  She said no to any tests done. She had the immediate reaction and she knew what to do. Patient further reported that she has allergy to alcohol and had an adverse reaction after the 2nd shot due to alcohol swab and on an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced redness and swelling in her right arm and feeling hot all over the body. Patient asked if her doctor will prescribe Benadryl to manage my allergy will it affect the effectiveness of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The patient did not recover from the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The outcome of the other events reported was unknown.

                                                shingles; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265; expiration date: 31May2021), intramuscular, administered in arm right on 28Jan2021 16:00 (at the age of 77-years-old) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included hysterectomy from 07Dec2020. There were no concomitant medications. Ten days later on 07Feb2021, the patient had onset of shingles. She was prescribed medication for shingles, and finished her last pill of that medication on 20Feb2021. She was scheduled to get her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine, and wanted to know if it would be ok to get that second dose relative to this event. She was scheduled to get her second covid-19 vaccine dose on the 11Mar2021. The clinical course of patient&#39;s shingles was described as all the bumps that she did get have dried except for one little spot; it all was on left side of head and face and it seems to be pretty much gone. One little sensitive spot remains where it first began back on the crown of her head on the left side. The itching is gone. The areas on the scalp and forehead have dried up, although there is still a little bumpiness but no itching or burning or anything like that. It&#39;s been an ordeal. She does feel like her doctor got her treated quickly and the medication was effective; the shingles was not as severe as some shingles cases can be. The event &#39;shingles&#39; resulted in physician office visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: everything looked good on 22Feb2021. The outcome of the event was recovering.

                                                April 14 pain in side of face; next day watery eye and rash above eye. Clariton D and advil helpful; April 27th am pain on top of left side of head and face and over eye.  Urgent care diagnosis shingles with eye complication; ER tested and then treated me for shingles. One week anti viral with f/u with ophtalmalogist and internist.  Antiviral extended one more week and cortisone and triple for eye area. I am still doing the lotion treatment and have gone back to eye doc twice and tomorrow again.   Tylenol 3 time a day.   I have since come down with a cold but getting over that.  It appears pfizer vacine has weakened my immune system for these other diseases.

The patient reported that she got the first dose of the vaccine and she did not think she paid much attention that day. The first day the patient threw up at breakfast and felt real nauseated then continued to have nausea with an upset stomach all day long and she did not know if that was making her headache or what, but she was nauseated all day long. The second day, she had a stomach upset. She went out that day and came home. She could not remember if she ate anything or not but then the next day she got nauseated with an upsets stomach. One night, she had itching all over her body then she feels like just blah. She took a Benadryl toward the morning because she could not stand the itching and thought if it was some type of allergy or something, maybe it could cut it down and she finally got to sleep. She wanted to know about the second dose because she heard a lot of people were super sick with the next vaccine and if she was having problems right now, whether she should take the another one. She saw the date range 17Feb2021-24Feb2021 and COVID 19 vaccine. She regularly took a blood pressure medication and an acid reflux. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12May2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0168) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included acne and migraine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 12May2021, patient experienced soreness in arm. On 13May2021, she had symptoms of rash on her face and it&#39;s itching, and the rash started in her face and ear, all on the left side, on her ear half way down the outside of the ear. She could see all the pimples on the face so she put hot water on it and used rubbing alcohol, which she thought would help curb the itching and dry it up, the bottom of the ear lobe is very much active going into jaw area still. She also had headache, and tiredness following her dose, the doctor told her if headache was severe, take a Tylenol with codeine, she took something with codeine and it went away after about three hours. She also had some breast pain (only in the enfold of her breast closest to the middle of her chest), sore to the touch, and it was very sore for about 24 hours, and that it hasn&#39;t fully resolved. Then, while bathing, she noticed a knot in the vaginal area right in the fold of pelvis and thigh inside of the pelvis that was painful, large, and the size of a quarter, if she push on the pelvic bone area, it would be painful. Also, while bathing, she identified cysts in the rectal area; after bathing she was trying to identify what they were, when she touched it, it hurt, it felt like a ball and eventually it went down and she caused them to bleed, not a lot of blood, just a small amount. She also started getting more growths in the vaginal area/bottom area near the rectum. Patient got sleepy and now made herself go lay down and she doesn&#39;t usually do that. She felt a little bad, she didn&#39;t think it was severe side effects, she knew things were going on that she could pinpoint to what would possibly happen but not these cysts. She was recently seen by her gynecologist, a week ago, and none of these problems were apparent at that time. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. Patient had blood work done on 07Apr2021 and 10Apr2021 before the vaccine. The outcome of cysts bleeding and soreness in arm was recovered on 13May2021, itching rash, breast pain, painful knot, cysts in the rectal area was recovering, headache was recovered, other event outcome was unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for Injection; Lot number: EW0753; Expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included surgeries. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for Injection; Lot Number: EW0173), as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. On unspecified date in May2021, a few days later after second dose, the patient&#39;s chest to all the way up to neck was brilliant, brilliant red and felt like really hard sandpaper, and around neck 2 long red lines, it looked like someone was trying to strangle. The patient went to the dermatologist, they did not know what it was, and they sent the sample out. In the meantime, the patient&#39;s whole body got covered in little red spots, and then slowly it started to peel off and the peeling was even on top of the hand, the patient still peeling, her rear end was still peeling skin off, It was like big sheets coming off, It scared the hell out of her, she did not know what was going on. Patient just told that no one else was having that kind of reaction that she had. It really scared her when it reached this far on the top of her neck where the chin starts because she thought oh my god it has got on the face too, but it stopped their and everything else got it. The first symptom was on her chest and that became brilliant red and looked like she was on fire and that was just as hard as a sandpaper. That was the first thing and slowly other things started, that brilliant red start and her body all started coming out with red spots. It did not itch and slowly it started to &#39;fluffing&#39; off and the skin was still &#39;fluffing&#39; off. Patient had the second vaccine almost a month ago. On the top of her hand there was peeling. It scared her to death because this thing has not been happened it was 6 months and she do not know why she got it and really do not know. She just wanted to report because she went to her own doctor and then to dermatologist. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow up needed, further information has been requested.

                                                she had 5 days of exhaustion where she felt like she couldn&#39;t get out of her chair; she was also very aware of her stomach; two twinges in her arm; she couldn&#39;t even stand clothes on her legs; skin on her left leg started to hurt so much that it reminded of her of having a neuralgia; She had stinging on the top and behind her knee and it traveled down towards her ankle and up towards her upper thigh/stinging in certain parts of her leg; skin on her left leg feels burning; left leg felt like it needed cold and not heat; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0178; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25May2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 77-year-old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation at Clinic. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure, high cholesterol and it runs in her family (She has tried all the different &#34;statin&#34; medications and she couldn&#39;t tolerate any of them. Her cardiologist told her there was an injection she could take for her cholesterol every two weeks and it was supposed to be like a &#34;liquid plumber&#34; for your veins. She is so sensitive to medications including all these &#34;statin&#34; medications, there is no way she can take the bi-weekly injection. It might have a much more profound negative affect on her. She was so leery of taking medications, even over the counter medications), gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 4 cardiac stent placements in 2015, blood pressure abnormal, allergies (unspecified), sinus are swollen, neuralgia, cataract surgery (a year and half ago), retina had swelled and sensitivity to heat. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRINE) chewable tablets at a dose of 81 mg daily for sinuses are swollen (her sinuses are not swollen at this time), loteprednol etabonate (LOTREL) for blood pressure abnormal. The Lotrel keeps her blood pressure around 120/70mmHg, famotidine (PEPCID) for gastrooesophageal reflux disease. The patient previously took tylenol and experienced allergy and giant hives. Aspirin give her hives but usually a hive here or there, not real big hives, ilevro for retina swelling and affected her skin on her face (She did have a problem while she was taking the steroid eye drops. They made her feel very unwell. She does not take Prednisone for the same reason. She had tried many different steroid eye drops and so many of them gave her a problem. She ended up taking Ilevro. She had no choice but to take it. The Ilevro affected the skin on her face. Her retinas had to stop swelling. Everything is fine now. She has no glaucoma or macular degeneration. This occurred a year and half ago when she had her cataract surgery). She had given the nurse who gave her the injection a list of all her allergies and sensitivities and the nurse reviewed the list and didn&#39;t see anything in the Covid 19 vaccine that would cause the caller harm based on her list of allergies and sensitivities. The caller took a deep breath and prayed while she received the Covid 19 vaccine. After the vaccine she waited at the facility and she was fine and then she left to go home. She ever had an adverse event with any other vaccines she reports she has not been vaccinated with anything since she was a child. She didn&#39;t even have the Polio vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the suspect vaccine. After getting the Covid 19 vaccine, on an unspecified date, the patient had 5 days of exhaustion where she felt like she couldn&#39;t get out of her chair and she was also very aware of her stomach. Her stomach wasn&#39;t upset but she was aware of it. That slowly passed and she started doing the things she needed to do. She needs to walk because of her heart stents. She had been fine after the Covid 19 vaccine until last night on 10Jun2021 at 21:30 the patient skin on her left leg started to hurt so much that it reminded of her of having a neuralgia. She provides an example of her sometimes feeling a draft and she can develop a neuralgia from the draft for a day or two. That&#39;s what her leg felt like initially. As the night wore on, around 22:00, she realized she couldn&#39;t even stand clothes on her legs. She wears nightgowns, not pajamas and she had to take her nightgown off her leg. The sensation in her leg started changing, she could feel that she not only had the skin hurting sensation but now she had stinging in certain parts of her leg. She had stinging on the top and behind her knee and it traveled down towards her ankle and up towards her upper thigh. It was bizarre. She thought about it this morning, 11Jun2021, what it felt like. She remembered way back, long ago, and she was not a sun person, but it felt like how a sunburn would feel. The skin on her left leg feels burning. She used Aspercreme on her leg thinking it will help with the pain. She wiped all the Aspercreme off her leg. She could not cover her left leg. Her left leg felt like it needed cold and not heat. She does have a history of sensitivity to heat. She runs her air conditioner, and she had a ceiling fan above her bed. She had her left leg exposed and out of her bed covers to try and get the cold air on her hot leg. Finally, around 23:30, her leg still bothered her, but she was able to go to sleep. She twisted and turned at night but was finally able to put her bed cover back on her leg but lightly. The sensation was still there in her leg. She was so sensitive. On an unspecified date, the patient had two twinges in her arm and then her arm never hurt again. The events did not result in emergency room or Physician Office. She is due for her second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Jun2021. The outcome of the events she had 5 days of exhaustion where she felt like she couldn&#39;t get out of her chair, she was also very aware of her stomach, two twinges in her arm was unknown and the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on lot/batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Caller asked if she should hold up a day or 2 for the next vaccine because she is scheduled tomorrow for her second dose and she doesn&#39;t want to have a severe reaction to the next one because she is still itchy all over. The rash and bumps began a few days later. The rash and bumps did not happen right away, it was a delayed reaction. It was not a bad rash; it was just a slight rash. Most of the rash was on the side of her stomach and chest with a few bumps. She also had a couple of bumps on her leg and thigh. The bumps on her leg and body did not all come at once. A couple of bumps would appear, and then a couple more, and then a little bit more. She took some Benadryl, and her granddaughter brought her some cream. She had been scratching on her back and arms: She had been scratching her back and arms, but there were no bumps or anything. She had been quite itching. Some days she was really itchy. This had been going on since she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. It was not a really bad itch, but she finds herself itching, and it was not normal for her. She thinks she received the first dose of the covid vaccine on 19May2021, but she might have that date wrong. She has trouble seeing and had to get a magnifying glass to read the information off of her vaccine record card. She clarifies that she did not receive the first dose of the covid vaccine on 19May 2021. She received the first dose of the covid vaccine three weeks ago from tomorrow. She received the first dose of the covid vaccine on 22May2021. She had to get something to enlarge the writing so she could read the correct date off of her vaccine record card.

A 77-year-old non-pregnant female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EM6198) via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included years ago penicillin allergy but have had since, bug bites allergy, allergic to mosquito bites and to insect bites, asthma, minor arthritis/spine, acid Reflux, high cholesterol. Concomitant medication(s) included atorvastatin calcium (STATIN), folic acid and multi-vitamin, vi taken for an unspecified indication in two weeks. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection) administration on right arm on 09Feb2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as dose 1 single for Covid-19 immunization and experienced similar event with 2nd dose along with large blister. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced similar events happened again after 2nd vaccine 02Mar2021 in same spots, no big blister just both elbows and neck, very very itchy as well as hive like hard bumps around elbow of same arm, as well as hive like bump near ear of right side. Followed by very itchy bumps on left arm at elbow site. Patient informed that after the 2nd shot it affected 2 elbows and the neck but no blister (same as the first but the first had the giant blister) and had gone to 2 physicians who didn&#39;t know what it was or if it may be an allergic reaction no one had identified it. Patient thought it was bug bites (allergic to mosquito bites and allergic to insect bites). It was so inflamed for a month patient was going crazy and doctor gave prednisone and Zyrtec. The 3rd person, patient spoke with thinks it&#39;s covid arm. No one can tell her what it was. Patient been to a dermatologist and internal doctor. Thinks it&#39;s the reaction to the covid vaccine. The problem with the reaction was when it&#39;s so inflamed. It feels like she got mosquito bite (like when she get a reaction) and didn&#39;t sleep the whole night. The doctor said, &#34;I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s a bug bite because it&#39;s so inflamed.&#34; Patient&#39;s asthma has been worse. It&#39;s horrible to have this. Thinking patient had bed bugs, it&#39;s been driving her crazy for a month. Patient informed that it&#39;s not just some itchiness, at first sight she thought she had insect bites. It happened in two locations under the right side of my neck which is like a big red blotch that was very itchy at the same time on my right arm and so the second time it happen it was not that bad, just in these isolated spots on right and left elbow and one side of face and neck, so it was isolated, it was not a rash, it was like an allergic reaction to mosquito bite but so itchy and red and inflamed. The doctor gave the patient antihistamine and now taking prednisone. Patient also asked about tests available to see if she had an allergic reaction to the pfizer vaccine. If the vaccine had histamine or would people who had allergies to bug bites have allergies to the Pfizer vaccine. The outcome of events hive like hard bumps around elbow of same arm, as well as hive like bump near ear of right side and very very itchy was recovering and rest all events was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                When I awoke this morning and was getting dressed, I noticed a soreness in the back of my left leg (on the right side of the left leg).  I felt a lump,  It was about 2-3 inches above the knee.  It was what I would describe as a medium-sized lump.  I called my doctor to leave a message about my symptoms.  My doctor called  a few minutes after 11 am and asked me to immediately come in so he could see the lump.  He thought I might have a blood clot.  This lump was not present late last night because when I put lotion on my legs after my shower, I felt no lump or soreness.  I worked out this morning and by 11:00, it seemed to me the lump was not as big as it was when I was getting dressed earlier this morning.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration upper arm probably only about 4inches down from shoulder blade on the left on 12Jan2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID on 01Oct2020. Concomitant medication included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) as blood thinner. The patient previously took a flu and shingles shot and experienced her redness and swelling on her arm. The patient did not have vaccinations four weeks prior, and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. She got it because she was told by her doctor that her antibodies will not last forever and it was still necessary to get it even though she already had COVID antibodies. She contracted COVID on 01Oct2020, that was the date when she had a positive test then she was last tested in December and she still had the antibodies then. She received her first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday 12Jan2021 and 24 hours later on 13Jan2021, she experienced chills and feeling very hot, which she took Tylenol extra strength for and it disappeared the next day. Her arm also swelled, not the whole arm, she would say about 3 inches around the site, 4 inches at the most and it was still swollen, it was red and itchy. Then she woke up in a horrible sweat but by the following morning it was gone. She wouldn&#39;t say it was a horrible reaction but she wanted to be certain she can go ahead and get the second shot which she had an appointment for. She said everything has resolved completely except for the swelling, her arm was still swollen, itchy, and red. Since the swelling, redness and itchiness began she would say it was slightly better than it was. The patient received the vaccine at an independent assisted living facility, not a military facility.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the covid vaccine, I developed a red flush on my face which was bright, hot and uncomfortable. The flush appeared nowhere else on my  body so I concluded that the vaccine must have interacted with the tretinoin cream I use nightly. That is the only area of my skin on which i apply the cream. When I got home, I applied soothing skin cream but no relief. I then tried aloe, which grows in the area, and the flush/burning abated somewhat. The next day, my face was still flushed but less red. the skin surface was scaly. I am continuing to treat at home. No MDs involved.

                                                swelling and significant bruise at injection site; swelling and significant bruise at injection site; This is a spontaneous report from two contactable nurses. A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number unknown), intramuscular into the left arm on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant drugs were none. The patient developed swelling and a pretty significant bruise where the injection was given in her left arm. The caller noticed the bruise and swelling on 25Jan2021 but states it could be older. The events were reported as medically significant. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of vaccination site swelling and bruise cannot be excluded, considering the temporal association and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.

                                                My Mom had an an allergic reaction four hours after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her face swelled up and became red....worse on the right side than the left...her eyes were swollen as well. It lasted this way for four days....it is a little better now, but her face is still a little swollen (seven days after shot). She had a headache on and off and felt tired (which we understand is not an allergic reaction, but rather an immune response). Her family physician suggested taking antihistamines before her second shot. Needless to say, we are apprehensive about what the outcome from the second shot will be like for her.

                                                Had CoVid vaccine #1 1/22/21 - felt fine. 2/5/21, eyes became swollen and red - called her eye Dr, who met her after hours at his clinic and diagnosed with shingles. She does not remember ever having chicken pox but states she might have forgotten. She called MC to inform us she could not return 2/11/21 for her second vaccination d/t the shingles. We also had a second person vaccinated the same day that also called with shingles so decision was made to enter this variance report.

Now the whole joint is red and a few of the other nodes have turned red.    Except for binding the first finger with the hope it would help (it didn&#39;t), I&#39;m not treating them, since of course one can&#39;t do anything about osteoarthritis except ease the pain.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6201), intramuscular, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021, 14:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy in feet, cholesterol (abnormal), 2 vertebra in her back that are starting to fuse, shrinking as she&#39;s getting older, allergic to NSAIDS, she clarifies Advil, Tylenol and the medications reverses on her and gives her a headache, and she gets itchy; was in the hospital for surgery, for lady stuff and needs glasses. She doesn&#39;t have a heart problem she doesn&#39;t have any other medical issues. She&#39;s not diabetic the neuropathy was idiopathic.  Concomitant medications included atorvastatin for cholesterol (abnormal), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA). The patient previously took morphine and was allergic, and hallucinating as she was told by the nurse, she said there were monkeys on the ceiling and her husband was trying to kill her and gets itchy with morphine. This is the same reaction she had when found out she had the reaction to NSAIDs, for example, she could take Advil or Tylenol for one night but it she took it two nights, that was when she woke up itching all over. She reports no rash, just itch. It just lasted that one night and it was gone. She could take some Advil and get that itchy feeling. On 01Mar2021, the patient experienced left arm aching from the site of the injection back down under the back of her arm to the back part of her elbow, then it comes to the far outer part of her forearm down to the wrist and ring finger and pinky finger; numbness down left arm/it was also partially numb, she has feeling because it&#39;s aching and she was describing it as an ache, not sharp just an ache. She can feel it, but its not all there. She knows all this stuff was new to all of us. She&#39;s following up and doesn&#39;t keep her up at night it&#39;s just not normal; and on 24Feb2021, her torso, the night after injection, from her armpits to her hips was itchy. She woke up and she went to the bathroom scratching her back and stomach. Her Covid 19 vaccine card was handwritten she sees 23Feb2021 and that&#39;s the date she got the shot. She&#39;s been isolating since Feb2020. She was only going out for necessity. She took a risk and had family at her home for Christmas. She hasn&#39;t been to church in almost a year, so she was taking this very seriously. Before they even started telling you to wear a mask she was listening to the news in December and January. She states, alright she&#39;s isolating, it&#39;s the safest thing she can do she&#39;s not ready to leave this world yet even knowing she&#39;s past her golden years. Her doctor put her on Atorvastatin it because of her age, she had blood drawn but she wasn&#39;t given any counts on an unspecified date. Her first thought was she had a chest problem but it&#39;s not a heart attack, the ache doesn&#39;t go any farther than what she told. It&#39;s not stopping her from being productive, from doing things. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room, physician office and was not hospitalized. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no events following prior vaccinations. Outcome of event itchy torso from armpits to hips/itchy back and stomach was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

                                                I had the second Covid (Pfizer) vaccine on February 22. The next day I had chills, fever, aches, nausea and was very weak. After about 30 hours I felt okay again.  However, a week and a half later, I noticed red bumps on the back of my neck. The next day, my neck and scalp had red, itchy blotches. Through the next five days, these spread down my body to my ankles until I was covered with the red, very itchy blotches. I did go to Urgent Care on the third day and I was given a 5-day prescription of Prednisone. It did not do much until the third day and then it relieved the itching somewhat for about 6 hours, but then it would start again. After the five days of Prednisone, I took Benedryl for three days until the itch and redness disappeared.  I checked the facility web site on types of rashes and my rash fits the description (and the photo) of a drug-related rash, but I have not changed or added any drugs for several years other than the Covid vaccine (I did some research online and found two other people who have had the same problems I have had after the second Covid vaccine. Both of them had the typical reaction of chills, fever, aches and dizziness for about a day after the second shot and then 1-2 weeks later, broke out in a rash. Both reported having the rash start at the neck or head and then spreading down the body throughout one to two weeks before disappearing. There were photos on the facility site of drug-related rashes and they were exactly like what I had.  Since the rash was almost certainly covid vaccine related, I am making this report, which my doctor recommended. I had no other changes in diet, medications, environment, etc. ? only the Pfizer vaccine was new to my body.

I took prednisone pills with no result so was give cortisone shot.  Still no relief.   This has been going on since a week following the second vaccine shot.   There have been no changes that I can recall in foods I eat or cleaning products I use or other things that might affect the skin.  The only new thing seems to be the vaccine.

A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Feb2021 (lot number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no known allergies. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9261), administered in the right arm on 01Feb2021 12:00 AM for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced achy body, tiredness, fever and chills. After the second vaccine early in the next morning (23Feb2021) around 3 am, the patient lost consciousness when retuning from the bathroom hitting her head and bruising body. She lay on the floor for approximately 15-20 minutes. She was ordered by her primary care physician to have a brain scan but when she had her blood pressure taken it was over 200 landing her in emergency room (ER) overnight to try to get her BP down. She was now on beta blockers and was still suffering with arrhythmia awaiting an appointment with her new cardiologist. She was hospitalized for 2 days due to the events.

This nurse (patient) reported that a 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6204) at the age of 78-years, via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 at single dose; first single dose of BNT162B2 (lot: EM9810) on 11Feb2021; both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoarthritis (having aches and pains) had for 20 years; large sliding hiatal hernia was diagnosed from an EGD six months before, didn&#39;t want surgery to fix it; heartburn (last five years); fatty liver, was not from drinking alcohol; generalized anxiety; was tuberculosis positive only because she was exposed years ago. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole started four to five years before at 40 mg twice a day for heartburn; escitalopram (tablet) been on for 15 years or longer at 10 mg 1 DF every day for generalized anxiety; clonazepam 0.5 mg nightly at bedtime for anxiety (been taking for last ten years or more, stops her from worrying about her kids and stuff like that). The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

                                                About 5 days after injection, I had a bout of nausea and diarrhea and noticed severe itching.  The stomach issues resolved after a couple  of  days, but the severe itching continued and is  especially bad wherever my clothing  comes in  contact  with my skin.  Over  the next several  weeks, I tried hydrocortisone cream, Benadryl gel, Benadryl tablets, Calamine  lotion, corn starch, menthol itch  cream,  but  nothing  has helped for very long.  I don&#39;t have much of a rash...just a bit  of raised redness when the itching is particularly bad.  I have been miserable with it.  I  visited my neurologist for  Botox injections  and asked her about  it and she said she  thinks I&#39;m having a  histamine reaction  to the Covid vaccine.  The severity of the itching  is getting slightly better,  but  it&#39;s  now  been almost 6 weeks of unrelenting itching.  I&#39;m  not taking Benadryl 3 times a day.

I assume that I probably scratched my head while shampooing my hair. Then next day my right eye started to bother me. I thought I had bumped my eye while trying to clean the discharge I have in the mornings with q-tips. But finally it got worse until it hurt me. So I went to the ophtlamologist today who according to his diagnosis I had shingles. I just got an antiviral medication for the next seven days and drops to help clean my eyelids. This is so bothersome, sometimes while trying to read I see blurry.

A 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at age of 78-years, at single dose in left arm on 03Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number was not reported) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes that diagnosed about 3 years ago, this year makes 4 years, and she took medications for it. And she was a little overweight, supposed to drop some but gained some back that because of diabetes. Historical Vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) also at age of 78-years, at single dose in left arm on 02Feb2021 13:00 for covid-19 immunisation and she had no problem with that one. Another Historical Vaccine included flu shots, it just lasted a day or two, maybe that&#39;s it, never had problems before. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported side effects from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Her arm was still bothering her. There was a lump down from where the injection site was and that she kept rubbing it but it won&#39;t go away and that she still had pain. She was told she should go to the doctor, but she thought she would call to see what was best to do. She had not a fever, just the lump on the arm, 4 inches down from the shoulder where she got the shot. The patient stated that both Pfizer COVID vaccines were in her left arm, she should have gotten it in the other arm. The patient stated she heard about blood clots and thought she&#39;d better check it out. The patient stated that she had the lump and her shoulder aches; not the shoulder the upper arm. The lump was on the inside and she kept rubbing it but it didn&#39;t go away. The patient had the second Pfizer COVID vaccine in the morning around 10:00 AM on 3Mar2021. The pain started the same day on 03Mar2021, then stated that night after midnight and that she thought it would go away. The lump in the arm started a couple of days after the Pfizer COVID vaccine, she thought it was a couple of days but maybe sooner, she didn&#39;t pay too much attention. The patient stated the lump felt like it was the size of a nickel, she was pushing to try to feel it and that maybe the lump was a little larger than a nickel. Her shoulder aches and the feeling went into the arm and it started the same week she had the shot but that she didn&#39;t pay any attention so is not sure exactly when it started. It was best to check it out with her doctor. The outcome for event pain and vaccination site lump was not recovered, while for remains event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                She got her vaccine, and within a day or two she had a feeling that her mouth was pulling sensation, and has had shingles in the paste.  She started using lip balm, and it would loosen up at the beginning.  Then, it started getting worse after a couple of days, and started circling her mouth.  On 3/5/21 she had a crust around her mouth and went to a doctor and said that she had psoriasis or eczema and told her that she could not treat it.   She has a band-aide on her face from the biopsy and has a picture for that.  She went to her for 4/5 visits and gave her a hydrocortisone cream and a cold tar treatment, and it stopped for about a week.   The cold tar burned to put it on her face, but was doing it, then that stopped.  She had an APT on 4/30/21 that she cancelled.  Then within the last 7 days it has recurred again.    She then went on 6/3/21 to Dr., which was a referral from her PCP, Dermatologist.  She demanded her records and he has marked off COVID screen and shingles in a circle and to FU in one month.   He has sent her to have patch testing, and to go see a Dr.  She informed the doctor of what she has been using for the rash, and he sent her to the other doctor.  She has a crack on her nose, and the cream made that area sore.  She has had shingles twice in the past.  The only place that she has the rash is on her neck upward, her face and seems to be moving to her forehead.  The other day it was on the side, and now has moved to the entire forehead.   She wears wigs due to the alopecia and seems to be moving up under the wig.  She has scaly skin, and crusty skin.    He did not diagnose her with shingles, but had it written on his form.  She asked if she had shingles and he told her that the Pfizer one had some symptoms of shingles.  She has tried eliminating foods, using other problems, and has been taking Benadryl and it&#39;s not helping the reaction.  He told her to go home and wash her face and not to be put anything on it and that it might go away on it&#39;s own, but she has had it for 3 months now.    She was very slight near the eyes.  Her right eye has had two detached retina and a cataract repair as well, and is worried that if it goes into her eye that she will be blind.  The rash is on both sides of her face not one sided.  She has put  cocoa butter cream on her lips and it seems to be helping her, but was told not to use it.  Told her to wash her face frequently and has an APT in a month to  have the patch biopsy.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 26Jan2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, Single Dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Von willebrand&#39;s disease Von Willebrand syndrome and Glanzmann&#39;s disease and allergies. Family history included bleeding disorder. She was poisoned by pesticides and formaldehyde years ago and they burned her entire respiratory system. There were no concomitant medications. The patient never had a reaction to a vaccine. No vaccines administered on same Date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations were given within 4 weeks and no adverse events following prior vaccinations. On an unspecified date of Feb2021, the patient experienced lips tingling, face red which felt like swollen, tongue started to tingle, her face felt tight. The events lasted about 1- 2 hours. Patient wanted to know; can she take a Benadryl before the vaccine. The second dose is due on 16Feb2021 so the first dose was 3 weeks before that one was due. After getting the shot, her lips started to tingle, tongue started to tingle, and her face felt real tight. When the nurse came out to check on her, she was told by the nurse her face was really red. The nurse was going to get an EpiPen and wanted to call EMS. The reporter states she told her to just give her a Benadryl, she normally has them in her car but had run out. Patient stated she was allergic to everything. Anything coming in contact with her respiratory system such as hair spray, scents, any chemical causes her problems. The patient explained that she was re-reading the information about telling the vaccination provider about medication conditions including allergies and bleeding disorder, both of which she has. She was concerned about getting the second dose. She wants to know if the first dose will offer any protection. She had the first dose of the covid shot on 26Jan2021. She started feeling funny. The patient called the nurse and reports her lips were tingling and her tongue was starting to tingle. Her face was really red. Her face felt like it had pressure like it was blowing up but it did not feel swollen, it was tomato red. The patient queried if she does not get the second dose what will that do. She knows there needs to be given a certain amount of time between the doses. She heard on the tv that it can be given up to 45 days and still be effective. She heard all kinds of information, she heard that someone should get the second dose within 28 days and the paperwork states something different. Asked if her reaction will be worse with second shot. She was supposed to go back on 16Feb2021 for the second dose. Patient stated she took Benadryl after her reaction from the vaccine. She wanted to know if this affects the vaccine. Patient mentioned the fact sheet states that patients should tell the vaccination provider if they have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner. She states she has a bleeding disorder. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. She took a Benadryl for treatment. The outcome of the event was resolved on an unspecified date of Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.

                                                I had itchiness and swelling around my eye. I thought it was a bug bite but it kept getting worse. Eventually, I had a rash around my eyes, my forehead, my hair. I went to the urgent care where they prescribed me an antiviral. The antiviral seems to be slowing things down. I am also now experiencing a crawling sensation throughout my body. It feels as if a bug crawling on me. This is something new that I have never experienced before.

The outcome of events flare, cataracts, nausea, flu like symptoms, was recovered; everything started hurting, back pain, swelling of fingers was not recovered; other events was unknown. The report was considered involved or prolonged inpatient hospitalization and other medically important condition.  Causality for humira (adalimumab): the reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of flare, body aches, nausea, flu like symptoms, depression, vomiting, lack of effect and urinary tract infection with humira(adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility. the reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of cataracts on both eyes, heart condition, fatigue, osteoarthritis affected knees and hands, two fingers on left hand and thumb would not bend was straight as a board, lump on left knee, one finger was bruised looking/burning and swollen finger on left hand after covid vaccine/hand swelling onset 02Mar2021, diabetes, another urinary tract infection, after taking covid vaccines and developed body aches and a flare with hands and achiness/sitting for long times everything started hurting, back pain, foot pain, shoulder pain, one finger was bruised looking/burning and swollen finger on left hand after covid vaccine/hand swelling onset 02Mar2021, redness in the hand and swelling in hand was not provided. Abbvie&#39;s opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of flare, cataracts on both eyes, fatigue, osteoarthritis affected knees and hands, two fingers on left hand and thumb would not bend was straight as a board, lump on left knee, one finger was bruised looking/burning and swollen finger on left hand after covid vaccine/hand swelling onset 02 mar 2021, depression, diabetes, vomiting, lack of effect, after taking covid vaccines and developed body aches and a flare with hands and achiness/sitting for long times everything started hurting, back pain, foot pain, shoulder pain, one finger was bruised looking/burning and swollen finger on left hand after covid vaccine/hand swelling onset 02Mar2021, redness in the hand and swelling in hand are related to humira(adalimumab). Abbvie&#39;s opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of body aches, nausea, flu like symptoms, urinary tract infection and another urinary tract infection are related to humira(adalimumab). Abbvie&#39;s opinion is that the event of heart condition is not assessable.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported events nausea, flu like symptoms, and vomiting are assessed as related to the suspect drug based on drug safety profile and temporal association. Other events are probably associated to patients underlying condition and are not related to BNT162B2. Case to be re-assessed upon receipt of new information.

                                                Itching began  about 48 hrs after injection.  Started in eyes and palms if hands but eventually spread over entire body.  Took a Claritine which gave no relief.  Calked Dr. office and they advised me to go to urgent care. Which I did.  Had the severe itching for about 3 hrs.  No difficulty breathing or swallowing.  Given IV fluids, normal saline and IV diphenhydramine ( up to 50 mg),  methylprednisone 125mg and famotidine 20mg.  Got relief quite rapidly.

                                                That evening I noticed a round bruised-looking circle above the area on the left shoulder where the shot was given.  The next day I noticed these same circles on the inside of my left arm, 3 of which felt like a pinpoint knot where they were (attaching pictures).  I can still feel the knot.  After a day or two I found 2 more on my right leg (one on the thigh and one down on the leg.)  I don&#39;t recall any little knots on these two.  I do not feel all of these areas spots are bothersome or worrisome but I was told by my daughter to notify the County about them.  I do take Plavix every day and have since 2003 which I feel may have caused this reaction.

                                                rash on both arms at the site of the nicotine patch; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3249) first dose on 19Jan2021 10:00 o left arm at single dose for want to be safe. Co-suspect product included nicotine transdermal system patch (lot number: 50430, expiration date: Mar2023) at 21mg; apply to the skin daily from Dec2020 (since 12Dec2020 or 15Dec2020)and ongoing for help stop smoking. Medical history included surgery on her neck in Dec2020 and states everything was fine and Diabetes. This surgery predates treatment with the vaccine. Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing insulin human, insulin human injection, isophane (HUMULIN 70/30) for Diabetes taking for over 10 years. The patient previously received Flu shot on 10Dec2021 (age 79-year-old female) for immunization. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. She just got the vaccine today (19Jan2021). Everything went fine. The shot didn&#39;t hurt. The process went really smooth. She just wants to get rid of this virus. She waited the time period there and then went home. When she was changing clothes after she got home, she noticed a rash. She had been wearing a nicotine patch. On both arms, in both places where she had worn the patch on her arms there is a rash. Clarified she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine 19Jan2021 at 10:00AM in the left arm. She noticed a couple of hours later a rash at the location of where she had previously worn the nicotine patch on both arms. She has been on the patch for a month and has not had any rash before. Adds she is supposed to use alternate arms and change daily. The rash is where she used it the last time. She did wash those places this morning before she had the shot so she thinks there shouldn&#39;t be any residue. She just changed it to a new location and there is no rash at the new location of the patch yet. Adds there is no pain or itching, just a rash. She is scheduled 09Feb2021 for the second dose. Mentions she was not sure if she should report but she didn&#39;t want another elderly person to get the rash and be scared. She imagines that Pfizer already tested the vaccine with tobacco. Event did not require a visit to physician or ER. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

Call the clinic and the lady who answered the phone found a doctor and asked what I should to.   The doctor suggested taking Bendryl.  I also washed the areas with soap and water which seemed to help.  In the morning I took a bath with baking soda; this also eased the rash.  I am continuing to take Benadryl, 1 tablet every 4 hours.

The patient previously took tetanus shot (TETANUS VACCINE) and flu shot (FLU VACCINE) on an unspecified date (reported as November) for immunisation. The patient verbalized, &#34;I just wanted to make sure that this is normal. I got my vaccine yesterday. I waited for 30 minutes because I did have an allergy (further clarification was unknown, hence captured as event), to make sure everything was okay. Nothing happened but after I got home within 2 hours my shoulder down to my elbow it is very sore and swollen. It is very sore and swollen for some days but it is just in the area where they gave the shot. So, I just want to make sure that it&#39;s normal.&#34; When asked about the treatment, the patient stated, &#34;No I did not I thought about taking some Aleve or whatever but my husband and I decided to wait till this morning and call to see that if it is normal like I said like a tetanus shot or flu shot. I am very sore in that area about 5 days but this was little different that it swelled from my shoulder to my elbow. I do not feel sick, I am not dizzy, and I am not short of breath. I read everything that they ask that they said you have a concern to call.&#34; Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received my vaccine on Sunday, work up Monday with sore arm which I expected. Monday night around 9pm I had a fever 101.3, my normal pain lever increased bad, and my balance of worse than normal, to walk 20 yards I had to stop at least 5 times because my back was hurting so bad. The next day, I woke up with normal fever but there was redness on the injection site a little larger than a silver dollar, around 8 my fever went up to 100. The next night, Wednesday night my fever was at 99.6, the next day my temp was normal and continued to be the rest of the time. The redness on my arm started fading and has continued to fade but I can still see where it is.

The patient had the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 21Jan2021 and the following day (22Jan2021), she experienced pain in the injection site and arm. The patient informed that it felt like someone stuck a knife in her muscle. The patient informed that the pain was improving and not sure if she wanted to get the second dose. The patient informed that she had a dental procedure done and was taking pain medication to help with that but it didn&#39;t help with her pain in her arm from the shot. The patient has been having pain at injection site all the way to her elbow. The patient informed that the first day they it was like she had a shot.

The patient informed that at night time that she sleeps perfect and when she gets up in the morning that it was bad pain. The patient informed that she was leery about getting her second shot. The patient informed that she had two teeth pulled on Friday (unspecified date) after she got the vaccine. The patient informed that they redid her partial for those teeth. The patient informed that they had prescribed 800 mg of ibuprofen for her teeth. The patient stated that she thought it would help the pain in her arm but it did not. The patient was told to keep taking it but she stopped. The patient informed that she has to take antibiotics for her teeth until they were all gone.

Vaccination site had an odd shaped reddishness. At one point I had on 4 layers of clothing and still shivered so put on my winter coat and tucked a heating pad inside. Temperature was a little above 100 accompanied by aching which all lasted 24 hours.

A 79-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at 08:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has a lot of medical conditions (unspecified). Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 (lot number: EL3286) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fever. The patient reported that she had her shot this morning (29Jan2021) at about 08:30 and towards evening, the shot started to hurt and so she wanted to make sure that it didn&#39;t go against anything, and put a little ice on it or maybe it was worthless on ice on certain situations after the fact that she thought this was too late. She wanted to make sure she could do that. The patient&#39;s blood pressure also went up on 29Jan2021. She was taking several different medicines for blood pressure. She took them already tonight. She was hoping that she will be feeling a little bit better. Sometimes, she gets a little fever on Jan2021, also like maybe 99 (unspecified). She just wanted to know if any of the medications were good or not for the shot. The patient was asking whether the drugs interacted. The patient also reported that when she took her first shot, she had a little fever and asked what she could take for it. An agent stated that she could take paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient mentioned that she took her pills, otherwise, her head felt like it was going to explode on Jan2021. She took her high blood pressure medicines. She has three medications namely clonidine, losartan and propranolol. She has a lot of medical conditions that was why she was calling because she takes other medications. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 79-year-old Female patient (also the age at vaccination) received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation (AFib) and back surgery (reported as: I am recovering from very serious back surgery) both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included methotrexate (reported as , it&#39;s a little cancer pill (Further clarification was unknown if consumer have cancer, hence cancer was not captured in medical condition), once a week), tocilizumab (ACTEMRA) (reported as I am on IV Infusions every 4 weeks and the name of it is Actemra), apixaban (ELIQUIS) (reported as I am on Eliquis because I am AFib, heart), and then another heart medicine plus all the patient&#39;s &#39;vitamins&#39; (unspecified). The patient previously took oxycodone and experienced allergy (reported as I can&#39;t take any of those drugs, I am allergic to all that stuff. Yeah I can&#39;t take any of that pain medicine (Unspecified Medications)). The patient stated that: &#34;I was calling about the, I had my first shot for the virus and on my chest, starting about middle of my chest up to my neck it started to get little bit bubbles on it and now it&#39;s just burning like crazy and it&#39;s starting around my ankles. Does that have anything to do with that shot?&#34; The reporter confirmed that the next shot is due on 22Feb2021. The patient added that, &#34;Actually last week they were really light, and they just keep getting worst. I was actually going to call my doctor tomorrow because I was concerned about getting this injection anyways because of my history on having reactions to medicine. I can&#39;t take any like Oxycodone or like any of those (also reported as &#34;I can&#39;t take any of those drugs, I am allergic to all that stuff. Yeah I can&#39;t take any of that pain medicine (Unspecified Medications). No, I don&#39;t have anything like that.&#34;). I can&#39;t take any of those drugs (Unspecified Medications). And she said she thought it would be alright but I am recovering from very serious back surgery and so I have had a hard time with that.

After a couple of days, a red rash about 6 inches in diameter appeared around the injection site. The rash is splotchy and bumpy. It is also hot. The rash continued to get larger. On the 6th day, I took a Benadryl tablet before going to bed. This morning (one week after the injection) the rash is not as hot and the knot seems slightly smaller. There is still swelling.

The patient&#39;s medical history included bladder infection (took antibiotics). Concomitant medications were not reported. Caller confirmed that she provided lot number during initial report on online portal. Caller stated that she did already go online and fill out the report questionnaire, because she had gotten an all over body rash. Caller stated that she had been taking an antibiotic prior to getting the first dose of the Covid vaccine, but she quit taking the antibiotic on Saturday, and then received the injection on Monday. Caller stated that she was wondering if that could have been a reason for getting the rash. Caller was also wondering if there was a recommendation for her getting the second dose following the side effects she experienced. Caller stated that she did not write down the reference number she was provided when she submitted her report online. There was no product complaint to report. Requested medical information (could an abx have interacted with the vaccine, recommendations on second dose). Caller would like to know if antibiotics would have had an effect on the Pfizer Covid vaccine. Caller received the Pfizer vaccine on Monday but was taking antibiotics for a bladder infection which she quit on Saturday. She got a body rash which lasted Monday to Tuesday. Caller would like to know whether she should get the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine knowing the side effect she had from the previous dose. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I had a delayed response to Covid 19 vaccine by one week, March 13th 2021. I had a bright red rash on hand, thighs, buttocks, with small blisters in between fingers and inside upper and lower lips. Also, had hives, welts, and swelling of these areas. Severe itching that did not subside. On March 14th I went to urgent care, by Tuesday March 16th it was worse, went to see Doctor and she increased Pepcid and prednisone dosage that I was given at urgent care. She increased my Zyrtec that I was taking from home and added Singulair. She did labs at this time. I was much better the week of March 21st and advised to see an allergist. Saw him on March 23rd, and he advised no more vaccines until her could test me. So far, April 1st there is no Pfizer vaccine available for test. I&#39;m making another virtual appointment for April 20th.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 30Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergic to penicillin and bee stings. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had flu vaccine and had a flu and shingles vaccine and had shingles for 3 weeks after she took the shingles vaccine. The patient received her first vaccine on 30Jan2021. On 31Jan2021, the patient ended up in ER with hives from the vaccine. She was told that she would be given Prednisone for hives but not to take it until Monday at noon. Stated that they wanted her to wait 48 hours after vaccine before she started it because it would cut it in half. She started Prednisone 40mg on Monday and did get a few more hives on Tuesday and Wednesday. She had the shot in her right arm, and all this happened on the left side of her back. She had a patch of hive of 5x6 to 8x8 on her back and on the back of her arm by her elbow and forearm. She put apple cider vinegar on her arms, and she did not itch anymore. Someone told her that this could be shingles. She stated that she got flu vaccine and got sick with flu and she took the shingles vaccine and got shingles. She could not stand in shower with the shingles but that she can with this, so she knows that it is not the shingles. The patient did not want to take the second shot on 20Feb2021 and wanted to know what Pfizer thinks. She does like to travel and hopes to soon so she wanted to know if not taking the shot could get a stipulation if they required two shots to travel. She has nerve on back shoulder to side and back of arm to forearm to her thumb which is not spasming, but she knows that it is there which came on in the past week (2021). She was on Prednisone 40 mg for 5 days and she still had hives (though they are diminishing). The patient stated that she still has &#34;lizard skin&#34;. She received the shot on her right arm, but the hives spread on the left shoulder down the arm and forearm where she had shingles. Her ER doctor told her not to take the second dose and her primary care physician told her to wait and think about it. She is wondering if she should receive the second dose. The outcome of the event hives was not recovered while the other events was unknown.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

Hypertension was experienced on 13:30. Her blood pressure usually was fairly low and was back to normal now. She had one reading of 124/76 to 170/something. Her normal range is anywhere between 150-170/70-80&#39;s. She is on Lisinopril. The other morning when it was 124/76, was just a fluke. That was an unusually good reading. They did a regular panel of lab work when she went to the ER. They did not tell her that anything was abnormal.  She asked them to run an A1C, but they told her they could not. They did a chest film, EKG, placed IV to give medications, but no fluids given. Her doctor said not to get second dose of the vaccine.  She had it at the hospital and they had reports of other people with a rash. The patient considered the events tachycardia, extreme flushing, macular erythematous rash and hypertension were medically significant while for headache was non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were possibly causally related to the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to plausible temporal relationship.

This 79-year-old female consumer reported that she recieved BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EM9809 and Expiration date ; not supplied) via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 (at the age of 79 years) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that She got the first dose 10Feb2021. She developed hives the next day 11Feb2021 and they stayed until she went to the doctor at least a week after and got the Prednisone. She was itching so bad. She says they have recovered at this point but another reason she was calling is that her doctor doesn&#39;t want to give anymore Prednisone for the next dose, She said they do not want to keep suppressing it. She guesses she will just have to see what&#39;s going to happen or maybe she shouldn&#39;t have it. The doctor said Pfizer may tell her not to take it. She does not see any expiration date or NDC number, just reminder for the next appointment. Dose: unknown to the caller. She just knows it was dose number 1 and that they went and got it. She says she thinks she will just follow up with her doctor and she also said to let them know when she gets the shot to watch her longer than 15 minutes, she may call them maybe they will just come up with some other medication to give her if she needs it because they do not want to give her Prednisone anymore. She guesses she will go take it and see what happens. She is sorry she could not find her doctor&#39;s address. Oh she found the doctor&#39;s information. Just so happens she got a piece of mail from them today. Investigation assessment; no. the outcome of events was recovered.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

The concomitant medications include Eliquis taken for pulmonary embolisms (2.5 mg, 2x/day) from unspecified date of Jan2017 to ongoing. Synthroid taken for thyroid problem from unspecified date to unspecified date. Eliquis has to be a pretty powerful drug; don&#39;t know about Pfizer Covid Vaccines, wondered if something interacted because excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand and couldn&#39;t move her fingers took a little over 4 days after Pfizer Covid Vaccine for onset. The patient previously took (years ago) hepatitis vaccine, shingles vaccine, pneumonia vaccine, no reactions to those; she was very cautious did not leave the office too soon after vaccines. She never got flu shot; when she was first in nurses training, she had a reaction to the flu vaccine in like 1960 and was in the emergency room.

She reported tiredness; eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see; excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand; She couldn&#39;t move her fingers. She also mentioned red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site. She reported she had absolutely no symptoms, nothing after the Pfizer Covid Vaccine other than tiredness, feeling kind of tired, that&#39;s about it. On27May2021 in the afternoon she had onset of her eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes. She washed her eyes out, and the burning and watering went away after she washed them. She had no make-up on, no eye make-up on for a few days at that time. Otherwise, everything was ok. She went to bed last night and during the night she woke up with excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand. She couldn&#39;t move her fingers for maybe a minute or two. Eventually she was able to move her fingers a little, then more and more and the event stopped, she kind of went back to normal and fell asleep. A couple of hours later she had the same event reoccur, just down to the hand, all 10 fingers, couldn&#39;t move them for a few minutes and then after that she could, they seemed to be ok, and she fell asleep again. Whether event started 27May2021 or 28May2021 is unknown, unknown onset times. She has been fined all day. She has written checks out, made meals, coffee, washed and dressed herself, had no other problems. At her age it was hard to tell when the tiredness started regarding time of onset. Thinks in the evening of 24May2021 she felt onset, tired and the next day on 25May2021 she had a couple episodes where her arms felt really heavy just for a short time maybe 30 seconds and then the episodes went away and she just felt tired. 26May2021 she noticed she was not as tired, and yesterday and today improved, feeling pretty good. Seriousness of all the events was not specified by reporter. The outcome of the events eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes was recovered on 27May2021. Time of onset: late morning, probably about 11:00-11:30 really burned, then eyes started to really, really water. She was familiar with her house so she held onto furniture to get to the bathroom and as soon as she rinsed her eyes out event never happened again. Her eyes are not bothering her.The outcome of excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand and couldn&#39;t move her fingers was resolved on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the event tiredness and red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site was recovering.  Follow up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on close temporal association the causal association between the reported event she almost could not see for a few minutes with the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The contributory effect of the patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications also need to be considered. The case will be reassessed should the additional information is available.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: unknown) via unspecified route of administration in arm left on 06Mar2021at 11:00 (at the age of 79-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Patient previously received flu vaccine in 2009 for immunization and had a reaction. She had the Flu vaccine for many years and the one she had trouble with was a vaccine without preservatives. On 06Mar2021, seven hours after receiving first dose of vaccination, in the evening patient noticed that her mouth started to burn, accidentally pinched her arm and the pain was more than expected and it left a bruise. On 12Mar2021, patient experienced sinus issues. On 20Mar2021, patient experienced that her legs were heavy and felt like they were weighted, which made it difficult for her to walk. On 22Mar2021, patient experienced burning pain on her lower lips, specifically in the space between the lip and the teeth. There was also burning pain in the face, in the arm and her neck-chest area, which caused great mental distress, a huge emotional toll, specifically being upset and devastated, lack of sleep, and weight lost due to lost of appetite with 5 pounds being lost within 2 weeks of these side effects. On an unspecified date in 2021, patient experienced hypersensitivity reaction. Patient stated that when she was changing her outfit she accidentally pinched her arm and the pain was more than expected and it left a bruise. About 7 hours after, she noticed that her mouth started to burn. She mentioned that she also had pineapple that day and was not sure if it was caused by the vaccine. On the 09Mar2021, she consulted a nurse practitioner who said that the burning may have been caused by the Pineapple. On 10Mar2021, she consulted her allergologist and got tested for a pineapple allergy. The results came in on 15Mar2021 and they came back negative for the allergy, but her allergologist mentioned that pineapple can still irritate the mouth. On 18Mar2021, she consulted with her Primary in which she was given magic mouthwash that made it worse. She was made to continue her benadryl and aspirin spray. On 20Mar2021, that Saturday night, as she was walking, she felt that her legs were heavy and felt like they were weighted, which made it difficult for her to walk. It lasted for about 20-30 minutes before subsiding. Last Monday, 22Mar2021 she really started to notice the burning pain on her lower lips, specifically in the space between the lip and the teeth. There was also burning pain in the face, in the arm and her neck-chest area. She described it as not constant but comes and goes. On 25Mar2021, she consulted with her primary again in which she was recommended not to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine and her side effects lean to a more neurologic cause. The doctor mentioned that the vaccine was still too new. These side effects has caused great mental distress, a huge emotional toll, specifically being upset and devastated, lack of sleep, and weight lost due to lost of appetite with 5 pounds being lost within 2 weeks of these side effects. She said that has not been fun. it has been horrible, and she would choose dying over this burning sensation in the mouth. Patient visited physician Office, 3 times and allergist did it virtually. Reportedly, after eating dinner she was eating pineapple from a can. She had the can and tried it. She had not had pineapple in a long time. While sitting in her recliner, she experienced her mouth burning. She added that began about an hour and a half after eating the pineapple and it has lasted for approximately 2 weeks. It was not constant all the time. She did not know at the time if the burning in the mouth was related to the pineapple. Caller added they thought it was the pineapple causing this. Last Sunday, the caller indicated that it was leaving and going away. Caller saw her new primary medical doctor on 09Mar2021. The Nurse Practitioner said it was probably the pineapple, She started her on Benadryl. Manufacturer was unknown to caller. Caller took 2 tablets on 09Mar2021 and stopped taking it on 10Mar2021. She restarted taking the Benadryl on about 14Mar2021. Caller stated she was primarily calling and asking because on Monday, 22Mar2021 she started having burning in her face and had burning in her arm.  Caller reported the burning in her arm was not from the vaccine and she thought it was caused by her blood pressure cuff.  Caller took her own blood pressure. Burning was better today, she still had burning in her arm. She took Zyrtec as instructed by her physician twice a day. She took a half tablet on 10Mar2021 through 13Mar2021. She was taking half a tablet in the morning and a half tablet at bedtime. Caller added that the Zyrtec made her feel unsteady and it made her sleepy. She did not tolerate it. Dose was 10mg. She has recovered completely from unsteady and being sleepy with Zyrtec. Caller took Tylenol because she was having sinus issues. She did not have the manufacturer, she took it on 12 and 20, two times. Its 325mg, by mouth, the regular strength. Caller saw an allergist on 10Mar2021 who tested her for pineapple allergy. The Allergist called on 15Mar2021 and reported she was not allergic to pineapple. Allergy was also tested for egg white, milk, wheat, corn, peanut, soybean, potato, yeast, and tomato. All resulted as negative. Benadryl: took 2 times in 09Mar2021. Caller restarted Benadryl and took it on 14Mar2021-17Mar2021. These days she only took it in the evening. She took 25 mg at night. Then she took Flonase, twice, on the 17th and 18th. Its over the counter. Lot number: TE8G, caller doesnt have box to provide UPC, stated there was another number of 0140592, expiry Mar2021. Dose was 27.5mcg per spray, spray into each nostril. When providing strength, states writing was so small for her to see. Gets a magnifying glass to confirm strength, states it&#39;s with her age. The doctor also suggested for the caller to try Afrin spray on 18Mar2021.  Caller started it on 20Mar2021 and used it only once. She didnt like it. Caller said at her age she occasionally breaks out and uses Clindamycin for that. Dermatologist has her using Clindamycin 1 per cent pledgets. Applied twice to face once daily, She stopped 20Mar2021. Given Magic Mouthwash, which was in a pharmacy bottle, she took it once on 18Mar2021, but stopped. It was 5-10ml swish and spit. It made things worse and did not improve it. The doctor forgot to give her a measuring cup, and caller thought she told her a teaspoon. Caller added she tried using a warm cloth on her sinus area and her skin felt like a sunburn. The cloth left a red area around her cheek. Then this Sunday, after using the pledgets, went for a walk, next day noticed her face was really burned, not just face, her neck, arms, but she was not exposed, but had a burning pain, and she still continued to have it.  She asked the dermatologist if this could be caused from the Clindamycin. The dermatologist told her no. She took a walk on Saturday and did not know if she was dehydrated.  She felt like there were weights on her feet as she walked. It lasted 30 minutes. The burning in mouth started 7 hours after the first dose and it had improved. Therapeutic measures taken in response to the events included Benadryl, Zyrtec, Tylenol, Flonase, Afrin spray, clindamycin, magic mouthwash. Outcome of the events &#34;mouth started to burn/burning in mouth&#34; and &#34;sinus issues&#34; were ongoing-not recovered and for all other events were unknown at the time of report.

The patient experienced blood pressure/ up to 210/110 mmHg on 20Feb2021 felt chills/chills on 31Jan2021, felt yucky on 31Jan2021, not walking well on 20Feb2021 , felt sick/sick as a dog on 20Feb2021, feeling nauseous on 20Feb2021, threw up like crazy on 20Feb2021, funny feeling around her head/feeling really funny on 20Feb2021, face usually gets red when her blood pressure is high and it she is not red at this time on 20Feb2021, vertigo on 20Feb2021, felt the really funny feeling going up her throat on an unspecified date in 2021, her heart rate has been wanting to be a little higher than usual on an unspecified date in 2021 and her balance was not quite right on an unspecified date in 2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 220/110 mmHg (normal value: 120/80) on 20Feb2021, computerised tomogram: doctor mentioned 3 little places on 20Feb2021, electrocardiogram: unknown results on 20Feb2021, heart rate: little higher than usual on an unspecified date in 2021, laboratory test: unknown results on 20Feb2021. Patient received both dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 11Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. On the next day after the 2nd dose, she felt chills. On 20Feb2021, she started not walking well, thought she would fall. All of a sudden, she felt sick and threw up like crazy while she was visiting her daughter for the day. The firefighters came to take her blood pressure and it was up to 210/110 mmHg. They advised her to go to the ER. After several hours, she was given blood pressure and nausea pills. They mentioned vertigo. She says it got okay. However, 2 weeks ago, she started to have a funny feeling around her head. Not dizzy but her face usually gets red when her blood pressure high and she was not red at that time. It was again reported that the day after she was administered the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had chills and felt yucky that day. She also reported feeling really funny since 20Feb2021. She was asked for further information on events related to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. She was at her daughter and noticed her balance was not quite right. She started feeling really funny so just lay down there for a little bit. When she did get up after about 15 minutes she started feeling nauseous. She got to the bathroom really fast and threw up like crazy. She did not have her blood pressure cuff with her so her daughter called the fire department and took her down there real fast. At the fire station they took her blood pressure which was 210/110 mmHg, so they suggested she head to the emergency room so she did. She was under observation in the emergency room, but not admitted to the hospital. The doctor mentioned vertigo somewhere along the way before she left the emergency room. She just kind of brushed the vertigo off until she was reading about that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine can cause vertigo. She guesses vertigo was what caused these events because she had been sick as a dog. When they got her on the bed and rolled her back she felt like she was going 90 miles per hour and by the time they got her back on the bed she was throwing up again-but this time and the initial onset of throwing up was the only times she threw up. They gave her something after probably 5-6 hours, blood pressure medicine and nausea medicine and she got ok and left there. Her heart rate has been wanting to be a little higher than usual. About 2 weeks ago she was just sitting on the couch and noticed especially when she would turn her head she still feels really funny; not dizzy, dizzy; she was walking ok; but the really funny feeling keeps hitting her continuously. During call when she sat back down she felt the really funny feeling going up her throat. It was just the weirdest thing, she wishes she had a word to really explain what the really funny feeling was but she does not. She has not checked her blood pressure for a while because she has been holding for a while for this department, so her blood pressure could be up a little bit, but she stated event was worse right now than it has been. Regarding testing/investigations while in the emergency room they did a CT head scan, lab tests, and an EKG. CT head scan results, the doctor mentioned 3 little places but when she talked to her doctor he said that was really just nothing to worry about with age; he said they will check it in 6 months and make sure areas are not growing. Caller has no further information to provide regarding lab tests or EKG results, they did not mention anything. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of blood pressure/ up to 210/110 mmHg and feeling nauseous. The outcome of the events, felt chills/Chills , Felt yucky, her balance was not quite right, felt sick/sick as a dog, threw up like crazy, face usually gets red when her blood pressure is high and it she is not red at this time, felt the really funny feeling going up her throat, Her heart rate has been wanting to be a little higher than usual was reported as unknown, not walking well, feeling nauseous and vertigo was reported as recovering, funny feeling around her head/Feeling really funny and blood pressure/ up to 210/110 mmHg was reported as not resolved.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, EH9896), via an unspecified route of administration to very top of right arm on 22Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. It was the first dose. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Medical history included glaucoma she had drops to take for, mostly she just has problem with her joints and her back with her age. She did not have any diseases or anything; she was not diabetic, nothing like that. There were no concomitant medications. She was administered her first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine on 22Dec2020. She reported that the pain or little discomfort she had in the arm she received the injection in disappeared by 25Dec2020. But on 24Dec2020 she started to get very sick, which continued to worsen until now when she felt like she was improving. She did not know if these events could have something to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Pain or little discomfort in the arm she received the injection: Right arm. Everyone warned her that the site would hurt, so she was really glad when it totally went away on 25Dec2020 and thought that it was over; any issues from the injection. Very sick: this event started to get bad on 24Dec2020, she was very tired and not very hungry, she had stomach and abdominal pains and loose stool; 25Dec2020 those symptoms were  worse. It was Christmas so she cooked and thought at first maybe she got carried away baking pies; because that evening she started to have pain and did not each much. 26Dec2020 it was worse; she said she was going to work on 27Dec2020; it was terrible because she was stuck for 12 hours trying to work while very sick. She called off of work 28Dec2020 and 29Dec2020. Since then she has stayed home and still has pain but she took her ranitidine delayed release 100mg twice daily as needed for stomach pain as given to her by her doctor, and is now down to just once daily. She did not know what she would have done without the ranitidine. She did not have any more abdominal pain, but her stomach was still very sensitive. She was tired but thought she was going to be ok. She was scared to get the second scheduled dose of COVID-19 Vaccine because she thought the side effects will be more severe with the booster shot. She just needed to rest and stay home which she has been doing. She has not had any fever. She has not notified her family doctor of these events. There was nothing she did on Christmas that she could think of other than she drank a glass of champagne because she did not know her stomach was going to be so bad. The outcome of the events Pain or little discomfort in the arm she received the injection was recovered on 25Dec2020, the outcome of event sickness was recovering, the outcome of the event Abdominal pain was recovered on an unknown date in Dec2020, the outcome of event stomach pain was not recovered, the outcome of the other events was unknown.

Never have had an allergy or allergic reaction all my life to anything.  The only thing different done since new year is the Covid-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) was the vaccine.  It was my first dose and questioning whether to do 2nd vaccination.  If I am allergic to the synthetic vaccine...I am uncertain about taking the 2nd dose which could catastrophically cause more problems as in constriction of breathing, rashes , death etc.  I am due for 2nd dose on 01/28/21.  I would appreciate input as to whether i should receive 2nd dose; and i wanted to report my adverse affect which i am still having.  Thank you.

Know this is normal, but on 3rd day it got considerably worse and this is now a week later, and arm is much better, but for 2-3 days it was painful.   Scheduled to back for 2nd injection on Feb. 13.  Is this going to be a problem?  Was told by oncologist 2 1/2 years ago not to use right arm for anything.   Do not want to miss 2nd injection.  OK to have injection again in the left arm?

                                                Developed a stiff neck after a week or so and thought nothing of it  until now because it is not going away.   Also , I developed an itchy pimply rash on my lower back that is  troublesome and for which I am using benedryl.  The asprin  nor the aleve seem to help the neck.  The itchy is driving me nuts--benedryl helps a little.  SHOULD I GET MY SECOND DOSE WHICH IS DUE FEBRUARY 10?

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot: EL8982) intramuscular in right arm on 22Jan2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Gastroparesis from 2016 and ongoing, ongoing Osteoarthritis (diagnosed about 10 to 20 years before), acid reflux (esophageal), blood pressure, osteoporosis, arthritis, anxiety, high cholesterol, stomach problems, allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, leg cramps at night, allergic to all kind of bites. Patient previously took shingles vaccine as immunization and she had had a small reaction, she had a patch of shingles break out around her arm at the site of injection site. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for Gastroparesis, ongoing erythromycin, ongoing aluminum hydroxide/magnesium carbonate (GAVISCON) for acid reflux (esophageal), ongoing calcium for Osteoporosis, ongoing losartan for Blood pressure, ongoing acetaminophen for arthritis, ongoing spironolactone as diuretic, ongoing tramadol for Osteoarthritis, vitamin C [ascorbic acid] as general supplementation, ongoing alprazolam for Anxiety, ongoing doxazosin for high blood pressure, ongoing fenofibrate for High cholesterol, ongoing vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX) as general supplementation, ongoing bisoprolol for high blood pressure, ongoing magnesium good for heart recommended by cardiologist, ongoing biotin for hair and nails, ongoing zinc as immunity booster, ongoing montelukast sodium for allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, ongoing levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) for allergies, ongoing cyclobenzaprine for leg cramps at night as muscle relaxer, ongoing macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) as laxative and ongoing &#34;CVS brand multivitamin at one tablet once a day oral as general supplementation&#34; (as reported).The patient experienced face felt hot and flushed and face red on 24Jan2021; gray spot on forehead on 25Jan2021; was tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot, face was burning and burned bright red face feeling sunburned in Jan2021.Events were described as follows: patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and she had a few mild symptoms. She did not feel really good for a day or two but it was nothing that alarmed her, she was tired and wiped out. She always took a shower since she had arthritis and it get gets her joints going. On 24Jan2021 after she got out of the shower, her face felt hot and it was red. She didn&#39;t think too much about it and it went away pretty soon. She did not connect it with the vaccine. On 25Jan2021 she took a little longer shower and the same thing happened, but it was 10 or 12 times worse in regards to her face feeling hot and was red. She was drying off and getting dressed and reported her face felt funny and it was really hot. When she looked at it was bright red like she had the worst sunburn, it felt like a sunburn. Her face was red and eyes were red bloodshot and it lasted about half an hour; her face got real flushed like a real bright sunburn and her face was burning and burned bright red. She started putting on cold wet wash cloths to help cool her face down and when it the wash cloths got warm, she would wet it again to cool her face down some more. She was alarmed but about 30 minutes later it started lightening up a bit and pretty soon it was back to normal. Her face felt different in the afternoon, it was a little red. She worked out in yard and last summer she got an insect bite on her forehead that turned gray, it was the size of silver dollar. After the hot flush thing this morning, that gray spot came back. Her doctor said it might take a while for it to go away. Her face felt warm like it has been sunburned. Her throat was dry since she has been waiting on the phone for an hour. Her face feeling sunburned/hot was about 95% gone, barely there. Her face getting red started on 24Jan2021 morning and it was almost gone. Treatment included ponds face cream and it was very soothing. Patient just wanted to know what to do about this flushing of her face and if it was dangerous what she can  do. She would like to know if she should be worried about this, it only happened when she took a shower. She was asking if there was anything she can do before she can get the second injection, so it does not happen again or what to do if it does happen again. Final outcome of tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot and face was burning and burned bright red/her face feeling sunburned/ face got really like the worst sunburn was unknown; outcome of the other events was not recovered.

My arm starting hurting &amp; a few days later, I broke out with tiny dark red spots inside a red swollen circle.  Arm remained with a burning aching pain. My dermatologist said it was definately shingles &amp; prescribed a 10 day treatment of antiviral medication.  She didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine but  should report this.   The shingles are just below the shot area.

                                                Asthma attack began about 20 minutes after injection, with throat tightening, slight mouth swelling sensation and immediate wheezing which grew progressively worse.  I had my inhalers (Levalbuterol and Flovent) with me, used Levalbuterol at the direction of medical people who surrounded me after I reported wheezing.  They gave me a Benadryl, then brought a wheel chair and sent me directly to the ER.  I was there about 3 hours during which I had a heart monitor,  a &#34;breathing treatment&#34; by a respiratory therapist, and DUONEB, famotidine (PEPCID), and (DELTASONE). I was given a 3 day Rx for 20 mg. of prednisone, and released.  My lungs felt &#34;twitchy&#34; the next day and my voice was muted, but was well otherwise.   The only &#34;normal&#34; side effect I had was some soreness at the injection site for a couple of days, with some light sensitivity there for a few weeks.

                                                Severe rash over entire body appearing in the evening after the shot.  Initial treatment with antihistamine had little effect. Eventually used triamcinolone cream and that helped to reduce the rash. Still persists 4 weeks later with lingering rash on legs.

An 80-year-old non-pregnant female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH-COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1289; expiration date: unknown) was 80-year-old at the time of vaccination via an unspecified route of administration right arm on 26Jan2021 09:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included myasthenia gravis, bipolar disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypothyroidism, high cholesterol and allergies to ACE inhibitors. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide, vilanterol trifenatate (TRELEGY), fluticasone propionate (ALLER FLO), cetirizine hydrochloride (ALLER TEC), aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN), clonazepam and ipratropium bromide (IPRA). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) but had allergies. The patient received the most recent COVID-19 vaccine in a hospital. On 28Jan2021 07:00 AM, the patient had injection site pain, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever 99-101 degrees. The patient who has a medical history of myasthenia gravis was given Pfizer-Biontech-Covid-19 Vaccine on 26Jan2021 with unknown outcome. The patient did not received treatment from the adverse events and the events was considered as non-serious. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of all the other events was not recovered.

On a scale of 1-10 the symtoms were 7-8 I also developed a rash on my arms as if I had been burned.  I had to use  an inhaler that I already  had and I ussed Hydocortisone cream on the rash  I saw the Nurse Practicioner on 2/10 2021 and was given Medrol 4mg tabs Today I am still coughing with slight tightness in my chest and the ras is resolving but scars linger.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

The patient developed heart flutter at night on 3/4/21, which she thought was a heart attack.  She called EMS and they checked her out and all her vitals were normal.  She saw her MD on 3/5/21 who said it was not a heart attack and she was fine.  He did not think the symptoms were related to the vaccination and he thought the heart flutter was stress related.   The heart flutter went away on it&#39;s own.   She also developed a red rash all over her body the evening of 3/5/21 that is still present.  She has been treating that with Vaseline intensive care and Aloe.  Her skin is very dry and crepey

An 80-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284) on left arm, intramuscular on 02Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pancreatic cancer stage IV metastasized, blood pressure (abnormal) and chemo. Concomitant medication included pancreatin (CREON) for pancreatic enzymes. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a side effect and it&#39;s so weird, she was a cancer patient she was in (city, state) and she had her first Covid vaccine on 12Jan2021 and she had her second one on 02Feb2021 and not a reaction until yesterday (06Feb2021) her left arm got a red rash, all the way up and down her shoulder to mid way between her elbow and hand and some swelling and she just wanted to make sure. She did look at the sheet and it does say you can get a rash, she has no temperature and she wanted to make sure that&#39;s a part of it all. When clarified if the retired registered nurse wanted to if it was the side effects from Covid vaccine, she stated, she guessed so because she got it on Tuesday and her arm hurt a little bit (Feb2021) but no rash showed up until yesterday which was Saturday. The patient had blood work done last Monday on 01Feb2021 with unknown results. The patient reported that she knows her white count was low (unspecified date) because they could give her chemo, so she actually has blood work on Monday 01Feb2021. Treatment was not received and patient stated, it just showed up yesterday and her nurse told her not to put anything on it. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Then on Saturday morning she noticed that there was a red circle light pink circle on her upper arm, about in the area of the injection.  Then over the next few days it got hot to touch, and the redness slowly started to spread.  Right now it has spread down to the inside of her upper left arm, and is very itchy.  She looked for a bug bite but has not seen one.  She called her pharmacist yesterday and he suggested that this often happens with this particular reaction to that vaccine and told her to take Benadryl and to put cortisone cream on that area, but the area is still hot to touch, red, itchy and hurting.

                                                Bacterial infection; Shingles; she broke out in a rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Jan2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL8982) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation; adalimumab (HUMIRA), via an unspecified route of administration from Nov2020 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) and ongoing, at 40mg (0.4mi) self injection every two weeks/She gets it twice a month) for psoriatic arthritis. Medical history included hypertension, diabetes type II, low thyroid, high cholesterol, chickenpox and she had part of her thyroid removed and psoriatic arthritis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included pravastatin taken for blood cholesterol increased from an unspecified start date and ongoing; ezetimibe (ZETIA) taken for blood cholesterol from an unspecified start date and ongoing; dulaglutide (TRULICITY) taken for type 2 diabetes mellitus from an unspecified start date and ongoing; azilsartan kamedoxomil (EDARBI) taken for blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; doxazosin taken for blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; l-thyroxine [levothyroxine] (L-THYROXINE) taken for low thyroid from an unspecified start date and ongoing; metformin hydrochloride, sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate (JANUMET XR) taken for type 2 diabetes mellitus, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took enbrel for psoriasis and experienced psoriatic arthropathy, enbrel for psoriasis and experienced psoriasis, and a flu shot. The patient was an 80 years old with compromised health because she takes a biological medication. On 20Jan2021, she had her first dose of COVID19 vaccine. No sore arm and everything was fine. On 27Jan2021, she broke out in a rash on her right lower arm between the elbow and wrist. She thought it was an allergy. When she thought it was more than that she went to the doctor. Diagnosed on 29Jan2021 with shingles. She was immediately put on the protocol of Gabapentin and Valtrex, the antiviral.  It got worse. She gave it one more day and yesterday she went to the doctor. She has a bacterial infection on top of shingles. She is on the second day of antibiotic. Her question is her second Pfizer COVID19 shot is scheduled for 10Feb2021. Should she take it? Is it safe to do that? She also wanted to report it so it would be part of the database in case other people break out. She wasn&#39;t allowed to take the Shingles vaccines because the doctors did not want her to because of her compromised system. She has not had Shingles vaccine, but she did have chickenpox when she was younger. The rash is raging and like a flesh eating monster. It is bacterial and shingles. The patient was on gabapentin strength: 100mg. She took one a day for three days and now is up to three a day. The patient&#39;s glasses are giving her trouble. She is nearly useless with all this going on. She had to get her husband to read the pharmacy vial for her. The patient was on Valtrex taking generic called Valacyclovir. It is 1 gram tablet. Taking it three times a day. NDC, lot, and expiry: product in a pharmacy vial. The antibiotic she was put on was Doxycycline Hyclate 100mg twice a day.  NDC, lot, and expiry: product in pharmacy vial. The biological medication she takes is Humira. She gets it twice a month. It is given by self injection with 29 gauge. She has been on a biological for 10 years. Before Humira she was on Enbrel. When she was put on Enbrel she had psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Enbrel took care of psoriasis. She still has psoriatic arthritis. They are gong to switch her to a new medication. She thinks it is called Talk, but she is not sure. She is waiting on the insurance to approve it. She has not started that yet. She thinks Gabapentin is affecting her vision. On the COVID19 vaccination card the information that said Pfizer, lot number, and date were on a little sticker that was taped on the card. Caller had to get her husband to read it to her. For the healthcare professional it was initialed. The patient doesn&#39;t want to die of Shingles either. These shingles are bad. She took the COVID vaccine because her health is compromised. She has hypertension, diabetes type II, and Psoriatic Arthritis. They qualified her for conditions along with her age. She thinks she stays positive because she doesn&#39;t dwell on this all the time. She just does it. She hasn&#39;t taken Humira since the diagnosis of Shingles because she has always been told to stop the biologic if she has an infection. She has been holding the Humira. It was due this week, but she did not take it. The outcome of the event rash was not recovered. The outcome of the rest of the events was unknown. The action taken of adalimumab for the events was temporarily withdrawn on unspecified date.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

Was seen by her primary MD and given antibiotics for presumed facial cellulitis (clindamycin and cephalexin). The facial swelling improved but then her right eye became red with worsened vision (3 days prior to presenting to ophthalmology). Exam found new onset of inflammation of the conjunctiva and all internal structures (panophthalmitis).

The leg was painful and tender to the touch. The patient also didn&#39;t sleep well and talked to someone on 27Feb2021 (reported as Saturday) and said it sounds like shingles to them. The patient talked to the doctor and they felt like it was shingles. The doctor put the patient on medication which has really helped a lot. The rash was not getting worse, it has just stayed a little better and the same. The doctor prescribed her prednisone and valacyclovir, 1mg three times a day. The rash seemed to get worse in the evening, it was painful all around her leg, she thought it was a blood clot, but then realized no because the pain was on the outside it doesn&#39;t feel like it was on the inside. The rash wasn&#39;t red, Friday late afternoon it started being raised. The pain in her leg was sensitive but not like it was. The patient has kept her leg covered, its impossible to do this because of where it was on her leg. The pain was worse Friday night, the patient was able to sleep Saturday night, it was still sensitive. The outcome of the event didn&#39;t sleep well was recovered on 27Feb2021 while the outcome of the other events were recovering.

Inside of mouth no longer burning ,   Swelling in lips has gone down, they have been peeling for days.  Lips are red, still sore, but I&#39;m hoping they are done peeling. I really don&#39;t feel I can handle another shot of this vaccine.   I think I may have to cancel the second shot.  I don&#39;t know what is it it, everyone keeps telling me it has no penicillin or sulfa drugs in it, but the symptoms are the same.  The only difference is my hands haven&#39;t cracked and peeled along with my lips and mouth.  I&#39;ve had these problems since last tuesday night and am taking Benadryl trying to get some relief from it still.  Please let me know if you have any solutions to prevent this.

An 80-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 20Feb2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (Lot Number: FL9265) at the age of 80-years-old, administered in the right arm on 30Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. In 2021, the patient experienced some sort of tear between her bowels and her urination tract and shingles. The clinical course was as follows: The patient came down with shingles. It was unknown the date the shingles began for the patient as shingles was not suspected at first.  It could have started maybe 2-3 weeks after the second dose. Then, as of 03May2021, the patient was hospitalized for some sort of tear between her bowels and her urination tract which required an unspecified operation to be performed the same day.  At the time of the report, the patient was still in the hospital and the patient was in quite a bit of pain. It was assumed the pain was part of the operation. However, it was dawning on her that it was pain from the shingles and was worse than before. The clinical outcome of the shingles was not recovered, while that of the tear between her bowels and her urination tract was unknown.   Amendment: This follow-up report is being submitted to allow appropriate reporting to health authorities.

                                                pruritis/itching all over; she is still tingling around her shoulders and neck; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reported for herself. An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection Batch/Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 13:30, as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure, ongoing cholesterol, and ongoing acid reflux. Concomitant medications included algeldrate, alginic acid, magnesium trisilicate, sodium bicarbonate (GAVISCON [ALGELDRATE; ALGINIC ACID; MAGNESIUM TRISILICATE; SODIUM BICARBONATE]); esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM [ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM]) taken as Antacid; vitamin d nos (VITAMIN D NOS); vitamin A; and blood pressure medicine (unspecified). On 20Feb2021 (Saturday), the patient got the first dose 20Feb2021 and the itching started after midnight. On 21Feb2021 at 02:00 AM, she experienced itching all-over, but it had diminished and was now on her shoulder and neck area. She noticed, it got worse after she has taken her reflux medication Nexium and Gaviscon and wanted to know the expected duration of this side effect. She mentioned that she had vaccine, Saturday at about 1:30 PM it was reported that it went fine but at about 2 AM she woke up itching and she didn&#39;t think anything about it and thought it would go way but continued and it gets worse when she takes her antacid. She quit taking her Nexium, it got worse with that antacid. It was a little better, but on an unspecified date in 2021, she was still tingling around her shoulders and neck and wanted to report it, but she also wanted to see how long she might have this problem or when would it go away finally. As her itching started after midnight and was fine until then which was why she thought it was something to do with her acid reflux medicine because she took it before she went to bed and then yesterday, she took Gaviscon, and the itching got worse. She says it was like Pepcid or something like that, it was an antacid. She also took her prescribed medication for acid reflux. It was improved but it was still there. Further she added that it was not like she itches and scratches all the time, but it was just there, mainly around shoulders and neck. She was startled she had any reaction because she did not right at first but might be people should know that you still could have a reaction. She took the Nexium that night before and she had taken all her medicines as well which was her blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine, Nexium, vitamin D and A vitamin. She had taken all of those the night she started itching. Last night all she took was her blood pressure medicine. She also had taken Tylenol and when she started itching like when it was bad, she took some, it was like allergy relief like Zyrtec (generic). Last night all she took was blood pressure medicine because she did not want to mess with anything. She had not taken any antacid since about 12 yesterday morning and the itching got worse than that was why she was thinking maybe that was the problem. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events with Tylenol and Zyrtec. The outcome of the event pruritis/itching all over was resolving, while the outcome of the other event was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible, no further information is expected.

She started crying and hyperventilating. I used an EpiPen on her immediately within 2 minutes of her turning red and she seemed to calm down for a few minutes. She was able to talk and ask questions. We gave her water to drink but then she started crying again and seemed to have more anxiety. Paramedics came within 15 minutes and took over.

                                                Developed blisters/rash on left buttock on Jan 31, 2021. I also felt extremely fatigued and had chills. I went to an appointment with a gynecologist for an unrelated chronic issue . (inflamed hemorrhoids) She examined my rash at that time and diagnosed it as shingles. Since that appointment the blisters began drying up. I continue to have itching, burning, and nerve pain on my left buttock.

A non-pregnant 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 26Jan2021 at 14:45 (02:45 PM), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was taking quite a few unspecified concomitant medications. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. The vaccine was administered in a clinic facility. On 27Jan2021, the patient&#39;s vaccine arm was a little tired and sore - typical of a shot. No problem, however. No treatment was administered for the adverse events. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient was recovering from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

Medical history included wrist had arthritis (pain). There were no concomitant medications. Patient height was a little less than 5. She used to be over 5 but she shrunk. Her weight used to be at 226 lbs, it came up to 230. This year (2021) it went up because, its her, she ate too much and she did not obey the rules. Patient received Pfizer vaccine on 06Feb2021 afternoon at 300 pm in her left arm and that night developed itchiness, numbness and tingling in her fingers on the right side. Last night (07Feb2021) she unable to sleep the whole night as a result of lots of pain in her wrist and hand but especially thumb/wrist on the right side. she also reported swelling in her hand and was hardly able to bend her fingers. She tried to bend her fingers and she can but her wrist was swollen, it was less right now but she still had the pain. She applied muscle relaxant (unclear if topical) and took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and massaged her hand with warm water and then for the second time she used the muscle relaxation. She hadn&#39;t taken paracetamol yet she was waiting 4 hours but the pain was still there, it was a little bit less. Not sure if it her arthritis or side effects from vaccine but believes it was from the vaccine. Stated she used to have the same problem with her wrist arthritis (pain). Also reported that she experienced additional side effects on 08Feb2021 which lasted about 5 minutes then went away: blurry eyes; wanting to faint; dizziness, sweating (whole body started to be like sweaty). Asking for information on muscle and joint pain after the vaccine and recommendations on what to do. So far she didn&#39;t know what it was, and if it was a side effect of the arthritis, because once in a while that happens but when it happened it went away right away but this time her wrist pain was there still there. Patient sat down and now she was stretching her leg, she sat down on the chair and its gone she had no more problems. Patient said her right hand, she was very slow writing. She said at least she can write her hand was going back to a routine but she was in a lot of pain. Outcome of event wanting to faint/dizziness, blurry eyes, sweating was recovered on 08Feb2021, and outcome of other events was unknown.

An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN6201), intramuscular at upper left arm on 21Feb2021 at 08:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included seasonal asthma, allergy to class A antihistamines that started in her 20s, facial &amp; peripheral edema, blood pressure abnormal, and celiac disease. The patient had known allergy to Benadryl and when she takes it she gets peripheral and facial edema, lip swelling, top and bottom, hives around her whole right eye. The patient also has an allergy to Class A antihistamines that started in her 20s. She said the allergy started with Seldane &amp; Claritin. She said she had giant hives with Claritin. She said she was told there were 2 classes of antihistamines &amp; she couldn&#39;t use the Class A antihistamines. She said she previously reported her Seldane, Claritin &amp; Benadryl allergies, saying she has facial &amp; peripheral edema. She said she only uses the Class B antihistamine Cimetidine now. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, omeprazole, and pravastatin. On an unspecified date, the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction, rash. On 21Feb2021, the patient experienced &#34;her upper lip became puffy/bottom lip began to swell,&#34; multiple hives all around her right eye, wheezing, and didn&#39;t feel comfortable. On 21Feb2021 at 14:00 (reported as about 2PM), the patient experienced &#34;Itching eyes/My eyes started itching.&#34; On 21Feb2021 at 21:00 (reported as 9PM), the patient experienced little coughing spell. The reporter considered the events swelling lips, itching eyes, multiple hives all around her right eye, and wheezing as serious medically significant. The patient further reported that she felt fine after the shot, her arm was not sore, nothing. She said her arm was fine, and she had no problems, whatsoever, after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has had some weird allergic reactions in the past, but no anaphylaxis. About 12:00 to 12:30 PM (also reported as around midday), the patient&#39;s lip felt puffy. She said she had ate an apple and thought maybe something was on the skin of the apple. She said then her bottom lip began to swell, so she took 3 Cimetidine (NDC Number: 49035-820-72, lot number: 9AE2576A, expiry date: Dec2020). The patient stated that she was allergic to what she believe are class A antihistamines as they gave her facial and peripheral edema including Benadryl and everything on the list. About 2PM, the patient&#39;s eyes felt itchy, she took allergy eye drops (eye drops seasonal relief with tetrahydrozoline HCL 0.05% and zinc sulfate 0.25%. She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient&#39;s lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler. She said she has been using the Serevent Diskus Inhaler for seasonal allergies for years and the inhaler works. She said she occasionally uses the Serevent Diskus for colds during the winter. She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus. NDC Number: 0173-0521-00, Lot Number: VV3E, Expiration Date: Sep2021) and Flovent (Flovent HFA 110mcg Inhaler, NDC Number: 0170719-20, Lot Number: C47A, Expiration Date: Jul2021). That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she&#39;s doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient&#39;s big concern was that she probably shouldn&#39;t get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

                                                After the first vaccine she experienced pain in arm and pain between the eyes. She also had flu like symptoms for approximately 3 days, and unusual bowel movements not diarrhea, not constipated, but not normal and painful.  After second dose had similar reaction bowel issues are still bad and very painful (to the point of vomiting during bowel movements  due to pain). She saw her primary care doctor and was Rx&#39;d a cream.  This has caused her to decrease her eating.  This did not help and she was having loss of visual acuity and started not being able to speak properly so went to the ED  for concern over Strokes.     had 2 MRIs, and determined not to be having a stroke so was released to home.  Sxs seemed to resolve ( like a spell) .   Was still having bowel issues and she also developed a rash from the neck to the groin. So she went to a specialist.   The Rash cleared after about 3 days.   Specialist advised that the sxs were all due to the COVID Vaccine.  Flank pain under the right ribs has also been present, this is not improving,  it is a dull pain that seems to be worsening  ( the bowel seems to be about back to normal now) She is planning on speaking with her PCP about the right flank pain.

She thought perhaps a bug bit  her and is spreading now around towards her face and has a tremendous itch.   She went to the clinic and they put her on Kenalog cream twice a day and then they said that she should take Claritin for the itching and Benadryl at night if possible.  They told her in the clinic that she has poison ivy/Dermatitis but she feels it may be related to her vaccine.

She then developed blisters on her feet that started out small, and progressed to be huge blisters.  She now has very blotchy skin on both arms. The left foot blister were worse than the right foot that eventually burst, and  3&#34; long and 2&#34; wide.  Mainly on the big toes and third toe of both feet.  They were itchy and came very red and blotchy.  Now is very dry skin and very scaly.  She has not worn shoes for a couple of weeks due to the blisters, and is still not able to wear them still.   She saw her doctor on the 30th and he did not give her anything to take as he said that he didn&#39;t know what it was in order to treat her.  She made a FU appointment and told her if they burst and it doesn&#39;t look any worse than when he saw her then to keep on doing what she was doing.  She has been putting on triple antibiotic ointment, and keep her feet elevated.

                                                shingles; burning bumps; rash/breaking out spot; back ache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and additional consumer (patient&#39;s daughter). An 81-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in right arm on 26Feb2021 13:45 (lot number: EN6198) at the age of 81 years old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoporosis and macular degeneration in both eyes. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccination included shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) on an unspecified date (about 5 years ago) for immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine four weeks prior to COVID vaccine. Patient mentioned she received her first COVID-19 vaccine on 26Feb2021. Then on 02Mar2021, she started having a back ache. Then by Friday, 05Mar2021 she started breaking out on her right side. She thought at first it was due to her using a heating pad for her back which was sore. Then on Sunday morning on 07Mar2021 she noticed a new breaking out area on her stomach. She thought she might have shingles. She was seen at her primary care doctor on 08Mar2021 and was told it was shingles. She was prescribed an antiviral drug now. She wanted to know if she should get the second COVID-19 shot and if the antiviral drug affect her getting the second shot. Patient noticed the breaking out on her right side towards her stomach and it may have started a day earlier. If it started on her back, she wasn&#39;t aware and she didn&#39;t feel it until Friday 05Mar2021. The breaking out started on her right side around towards her torso and a little backwards towards her back. On her waistline, lower than her waistline, a little bit lower. Right where her thigh meets her torso. Like her hip kind of like a crack there. The backache she can&#39;t feel any more, she wondered if the backache was a precursor to shingles or not. Referring to the backache, maybe she didn&#39;t notice it, maybe it was on 08Mar2021 that she didn&#39;t notice the backache anymore. Patient&#39;s daughter mentioned her mom was still on 07Mar2021. On Friday 05Mar2021 at bedtime she noticed the breaking out area, and it still burns, the bumps. The rash/breaking out spot is still there and hurts. They are bumps not blisters. When she looked at it this morning 09Mar2021 after taking three of the anti-viral pills the breaking out area is not as bright, maybe a little duller red color. She uses a magnifying glass when probed for details from the Patient Vaccination Card. She has low vision in both eyes due to macular degeneration. She went to the doctor on 08Mar2021. She was prescribed antiviral, Valacyclovir 1 gram tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily. She started taking this on 08Mar2021, was prescribed 21 pills for 7 days. NDC/Lot#/Expiry unknown, discard after Mar2022. Did not see on bottle to provide. When asked about if print was small it was clarified this was a blue bottle filled by the pharmacy. It is not a manufacturer bottle. She first saw the breaking out area on Friday 05Mar2021 night and didn&#39;t think anything about it until Sunday 07Mar2021 when she had a new break out. Her second COVID-19 injection is scheduled for 19Mar2021. She did have shingles shot about 5 years ago. And she knows they have a new one, but she has not taken the new one. Her doctor told her yesterday 08Mar2021 to get the shingles vaccine. She hasn&#39;t decided if she&#39;s getting the shingles vaccine or not. The event shingles required visit to Physician office. The patient recovered from backache on 08Mar2021; recovering from shingles; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

But the next day, she didn&#39;t have a fever, and she could use that same chair without help. Caller states that she was fine by Friday and her blood sugar was 95, which was good. Caller states that she had a backache a few days following, but she has had backache before. Caller states that this was her history, she had the COVID, and she had a bleeding ulcer over a year ago now. Caller also saw a Cardiologist and had the watchman device implanted at the end of Sep2020, caller had this procedure to try and help get her off the Eliquis, which she had been on since having the stroke. Caller reports that she also had a Rectal bleed when she was put back on the Eliquis, and her doctors kept her on it because of the stroke. Caller states that she has silent A. Fib and that can throw little clots, so the doctors wanted her on a low dose of Eliquis but apparently that was too much for the caller too. Caller thinks the heart procedure is doing great and doing its job, but she was unable to go in for her follow up to the procedure, because she needed an esophageal echocardiogram to see if the device was sealed over by the heart muscle, and she couldn&#39;t have that until Jan2020, because she had to test negative for COVID twice. Caller states that her hemoglobin never really recovered more than 10 since her bleeding ulcer. But her hemoglobin went down to 7.4 and she was sent to the ER at the end of Jan2021, and she had two transfusions, and the next morning her hemoglobin went down to 7, the hospital staff thought that she must be bleeding. So the caller saw a GI doctor who said that the caller needed an endoscopy and colonoscopy to see where this was coming from, to make sure she was not bleeding from the ulcer. They saw the ulcer was healed but irritated, and the colonoscopy removed a couple polyps. The polyps were negative for cancer cells. After the caller had the COVID injection, she had blood in her stool. Caller went to the ER in the evening of 08Mar2021, and she stayed in the ER until the next morning. Caller states that the stool sample did show that there was some blood in her urine (captured as provided by the caller), and the ER did a CT of her abdomen, and they didn&#39;t see blood or diverticulitis. Caller does have a history of diverticulosis or internal hemorrhoids. Because things were going on last Fall, and things were rescheduled with the COVID disease, and things, the caller did not get her regular flu shot until 12Jan2021, because she needed two negative COVID tests prior to being able to get the Flu shot. She got two negative COVID tests on 24Dec2020 and 06Jan2021. Caller does not know if having had her flu shot in Jan2021, could have affected it. Caller was concerned and was wondering if she should take the second dose of the COVID vaccine or not. HCP Details: Caller hasn&#39;t spoken to her PCP since she was last in the hospital. She tried to call her HCP, but that office was getting a new computer system and they were having a high call volume for COVID stuff, so caller could not get through to them. Caller plans to email her doctor today. Everything has been overwhelming with all these things and people for doctors to juggle. Event Details: Caller reports that the soreness at her injection site, by the next morning, was up into her shoulder. Caller states that her niece, who was not a nurse, called the caller and told her to get the injection three fingers below the shoulder joint, because there were some instances of people getting injected into the shoulder joint. So, caller had soreness at the injection site, but within 24 hours, states that she was just sore all over, but it all went away by the afternoon the next day. Caller states that, she was told that she would have reactions more to the second injection than the first, so that was her concern, was she does not want to get the second injection and then it be worse than what she experienced. Caller had a lot of pain in her toes following the COVID injection, but she has diabetes that was well controlled, and she has neuropathy, and probably arthritis. But caller states that the pain in her toes was worse than normal, following receiving the COVID vaccine. Caller has had a bunionectomy, so she always has some numbness in the toe, and she fell and broke her ankle a few years later. But caller states that the very concerning thing was, following the COVID injection, the joint pain and soreness all over and weakness that she experienced. Caller had the stiffness together with some of the other things from her low hemoglobin anyway, as she has not fully recovered from the blood loss, but she was much better, and after the transfusions she had a hemoglobin of 10. And when caller went to the hospital lately, her hemoglobin was 9.4, and she was having it tested Tuesday morning again. Caller states that it was hard to say that everything she experienced was from the COVID vaccine, as she has a history of some of these things, including weakness. Caller finally got off the Eliquis when the hemoglobin went so low, she stopped the Eliquis maybe on 29Jan2021. Caller states that she was told by her Cardiologist that her symptoms at the time were from low Hemoglobin. Caller states that she was probably walking around with that low hemoglobin for a few days. Weakness: Caller states that at times she gets very fatigued, but she was not so weak right now. But caller states that weakness has been an up and down thing for her for the past few months, even before the COVID vaccine. Treatment: Caller took her normal Aspirin, but she did not take Tylenol even though she was told she could, and she did not take Allegra. She just took her normal medicines. History: When caller had her rectal bleed, she went into the ER on 08Mar2021, and she was sent home the next morning. Caller states that the ER was busy that evening and did not see the doctor until 10 or 11 that evening. But when the tests were finished up around 3am, the caller was told that she could go home or be admitted. Caller asked to go home but not until a little later in the morning, so she could call her family. Knee Bleed: Caller confirms it was aspirated and treated in the ER; she did not have to stay overnight. Caller saw orthopedic doctor a day or two later, and he did not order anything else. Caller walks with a cane now most the time because she is trying to avoid falling. Eliquis: Caller reports that the Eliquis was held for a few days after her GI bleed. She was taking 5mg twice a day from April or May2018. Caller had the GI bleed and the Eliquis was held for a few days and then she went back on it, then had rectal bleeding again. So, after that, caller&#39;s dose was reduced to 2.5mg twice day. The doctors did not want to take her off the Eliquis because of her prior stroke, so they just reduced her dose. The Eliquis had been preventing little TIAs and stuff in her hand and mouth and stuff. And that reduced dose was okay for a while. But caller states that she started getting those symptoms back, and several times a day she was getting the numbness, and she was scared she was going to have a stroke, so she said maybe because she was previously on mg twice a day, maybe she should up her dose to 7.5mg, and that worked well. So, caller took 5mg in the morning and 2.5mg in the evening. This was over a weekend, and on Monday the caller wrote her cardiologist, who said this dosing was not normally recommended, but if it was working for the caller, then that is okay. But then in July, the caller got the knee bleed. So, the doctors thought the caller&#39;s knee bleed was from the 2.5mg knee bleed but caller thinks she started to get that earlier because she had an episode that was similar before that, caller thought that episode in May or so was just arthritis. But, in Jul2020 her knee became swollen, very painful, and she could not get out of bed. Caller states that her son who was a weightlifter could not get her out of bed. She went to hospital via ambulance where her knee was aspirated. Caller reports that the Eliquis was not stopped due to the knee bleed, she was just told to go back to 2.5mg twice daily. Caller states that her heart doctor said that because she has had a stroke, she has to take the Eliquis to prevent stroke. Caller reports that she initially was not interested in the Watchman implant, but after all this, she decided to get that procedure so she could stop the Eliquis because she was a bleeder. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included colonoscopy: the ulcer was healed but irritated, endoscopy: the ulcer was healed but irritated, haemoglobin: 7.4 on Jan2021, haemoglobin: 7 on Jan2021. The outcome of sore arm and weakness was unknown, headache, stiffness/Neck stiffness, chills, soreness all over the body, moderate soreness at the injection site, Joint pain, felt cold, tiny red spot at injection site about the size of a dime were recovered on 03Mar2021 and back pain recovered on 09Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of pain in arm,toe,headache,stiffness,chills,weakness,pain,joint pain,feeling cold,vaccination site erythema,pain and pain in toe.

An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E73246, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 14:15 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cardiac pacemaker insertion, high blood pressure for years. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS). The patient previously took flu shot (FLU VACCINE II) and never had a reaction to the flu shot, macrodantin and experienced drug hypersensitivity and hives. It was reported that about 15:15, injection site felt like it was on fire and then the whole arm felt like it was on fire. The patient got concerned. Her throat felt like it was going to close. Symptoms got less severe. She was fine yesterday and was fine that day. She called her doctor and was advised to put cold compresses on the arm and take Tylenol. She was ok. She read an article that stated if a person had a reaction to not have the second shot. She did not know if her reaction is severe. The second shot is due around 27Jan2021. She wanted to know what to do.  She felt fine on the day of report and was fine 2-3 hours after the onset of the hot and fiery feeling. It was scary and she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She also added that around 15:15, the injection arm felt like it was on fire. She felt flushed. Her throat felt like it would close up but never did. Everything resolved 2-3 hours after it started. Clinical outcome of the events was recovered on 06Jan2021.

                                                My left arm started to hurt during the night and when I got up on Friday, the 12th it was hard to move it without severe muscular pain.  The pain has persisted into today, Monday, the 15th,  but it is slowly getting better.  The pain is localized to my upper arm, and depending on how I move it, can become worse.   I am treating the symptoms with Tylenol and aspirin-containing creams.

The on the 4th I have a lady who comes out to my house and helps me bath and she put gold bond lotion all over.  I thought it was the lotion so I bathed again and got the lotion off my body. It is has since gotten worse and worse, I have  little red spots on back, shoulders and arm. My shoulder has red bumps on it, looks like a rash and is rough feeling. The itching and spots are still there as of 2/23/2021. I spoke PA at my doctor&#39;s office and she called in  a prescription Pepcid AC 20 MG (one a day) and Wal-zyr (generic Zyrtec )  on the 2/19/2021. I have also been putting some Hydrocortisone cream on it as well.

                                                itchy skin all over body, but primarily on my upper back where a red rash appeared following each of the two vaccine shots. Not sure of the date ot its first appearance following Shot #1 ; I felt fine for four days after shot # 2, then the itch and rash intensified so that I had great trouble sleeping. My upper back is itching now as I type, but seems to have begun to fade; and, the rest of my body is pretty pretty much itch free. I began applying an herbal tincture to the rash on my back on March 1st which seems to be helping calm it down.

A 82-years-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot # EL8982) vaccine, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm  on 29Jan2021 13:30 at single dose  for Covid-19 immunisation .  Medical history included anticoagulant therapy , bone disorder, vitamin D deficiency (vitamin supplementation), probiotic therapy, rhinorrhoea, lung congestion, dry eye .  Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81), calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (CALCIUM 500&#43;D3), colecalciferol (D3), ascorbic acid, tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc (AREDS), bifidobacterium infantis (ALIGN) , guaifenesin (MUCINEX), macrogol 400, propylene glycol (SYSTANE), metronidazole (METRONIDAZOLE).  The patient experienced the needle had not been completely secured  on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown ,  felt fluid rushing down her arm/solution ran down her arm/it ran to her elbow, she saw a collection of fluid at her elbow/ two drops of medication leak down her arm  on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown , i had a lump on my arm the size of a large jaw breaker in my arm/hard lump at injection site for about 5 hours  on 29Jan2021 with outcome of recovered , bruising at the site  on 29Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered , headache on 30Jan2021 with outcome of recovered.  The patient took Tylenol for her  headache. The patient stated that states her injection site was already black and blue when she got home and removed the bandage. Adds in her photo her whole shoulder is yellow and it looks jaundiced.  The nurse stated that the incident occurred on Friday 29Jan2021 , so they had multiple different type of syringes and needles that was using to administered and they had a vaccinator who was using a lower lock syringe in which you case you know you have to secure the needle by twisting in to that lower lock and when he went to administer the vaccine to the patient two drops of medication leak down her arm, so of course we are at that point the vaccinator realize the lower lock and that the needle had not been completely secured so we don&#39;t know how much vaccine the patient actually received.  Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.

The middle of it was raised with the circumference of about a penny, and now at 9:30pm it is about 1/4 inch in diameter.  It feels dense to the touch.  She doesn&#39;t feel pain, and it was the only one she noticed on her body.  We watched it to make sure it didn&#39;t grow and that she didn&#39;t develop anymore today. She has a doctor&#39;s appointment tomorrow 4/6/21, so she will bring it up to her doctor then.

                                                COVID Vaccine  I got my #2 Pfizer last Tuesday Apr 6....no problem at all with #1.  The vaccination was in my LEFT arm, and the 1st day or so I didn&#39;t really have anything but tiredness.  But the last few days have been very painful.  I developed swelling on the RIGHT side of my face starting at the temple. That progressed down to the ear area the next few days and was quite painful.   Since Saturday  my tongue, lips, gums became swollen resulting in barely being able to swallow. Also rash developed and is getting worse.  Additionally I ache all over and feel like a very bad case of the flu.  I tried Tylenol Extra Strength in the beginning, but that seemed to only ease the pain for about an hour.  Now I&#39;m  using  Advil, which helps for several hours.  Is there anything I can do to get relief.  This is the 8th day....and it seems to be getting worse instead of better.

She should have gone to the emergency room, but she was afraid they would admit her. She had read this paper on what she should, and she had almost every time. She went to her physician on 25May2021, and that they were giving the vaccine at his office and that it would be on the Friday (28May2021). Her physician had said that she needed to take the virus shot, but Friday (28May2021), it would be like to 12 o&#39;clock and she had been there on Tuesday for a physical. She said that they wanted her to make sure if she wasn&#39;t coming and reschedule. She said that she went to store on the following Saturday on 29May2021.

Her son told her to put some cold compresses on it. She stated that she had been putting warm and that it had helped.

So patient got up and went into bathroom and patient put some anti-itch that&#39;s what patient husband had for his allergies. Patient said the spots on knees, the red spots are basically gone but they were still there and the left knees was specially bad and you can feel through pants even that it&#39;s warm on these places but when rubbing hands on it you can&#39;t feel rash or anything, it was more like a discoloration in skin, there was also a red spot over the injection site, patient would say about the size of a tennis ball and also there was a swelling just that gone bad but and it was okay really but it was there, patient had at a place on belly and it was gone, so let do something else but the discoloration on leg the splotches, patient guess they called splotches not a rash like a pimply rash but just there and they itch something there but it was getting better now.

An 83-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3248, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 19Jan2021 14:20 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing obesity from 2018 (onset was around time her husband died in 2018. She thinks she started getting more sedentary and picking up weight about then). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine and no additional vaccines administered on same date of the bnt162b2. The patient previously had smallpox vaccine for immunization when she was a child and that of which really worked, but it was not just a neat little thing and she still has the scar on her upper arm; and varicella zoster vaccine rge (cho) (SHINGRIX) on unspecified date in 2019 for immunization. She had quite a reaction to this first dose of SHINGRIX vaccine but cannot remember what the symptoms she had were; she was down for a few days with that. She told her family doctor about the reaction, and that she received the vaccine at (pharmacy name); the family doctor said she should not get the second dose of the SHINGRIX. On 20Jan2021, the patient experienced her injection site left arm turned &#34;kinda pinky/red and a little puffy, with a little heat/warm and tender to the touch.&#34; Outcome of the all the events was unknown.

                                                I developed a very sore arm.  It swelled around the injection site, turned red, formed a hard lump and was hot to the touch..  This has lasted all week but it has become progressively less.  I am very active (for my age).  I swim 1/2 mile laps twice a week; do regular exercises for balance and to relieve back pain and regularly do tai chi.   I think this exercise, especially with my arms has helped reduce the symptoms.  The symptom wasn&#39;t serious and did not impede my activities.  I am sending this because I thought it might be helpful.

She treated at home with benedryl and hydrocortisone.  On 2/13 she continued to have itching/rash and also developed a welt at the injection site. She visited the urgent care where she had an elevated blood pressure of 210/100 and 170/90. As an ICU nurse, I can attest that my mother?s blood pressure always runs in the 90s-100 systolic range. She received an injection of solumedrol and Benadryl orally and was given a prescription for prednisone for 3 days total.

Caller was asking if she should get the second shot. She went to her doctor and was told it was ok if she got the second shot. The doctor said it was too far between the shot and the reactions for it to be the shot. She received the vaccine on 27Jan2021. On Saturday morning she took Vitamin D, B complex, Digoxin and Rosuvastatin. Twenty minutes later her chin felt funny. Her face was red and burning. She felt like she was going to faint. She got some ice and washed her face. She took 2 baby aspirin. She asked her doctor if she was allergic to the vaccine. Her doctor said the time between getting the vaccine and the events were too far between. She thought she was going to pass out. She felt better after washing her face with ice. She was her face for 30-45 minutes with ice water.  She took apixaban (ELIQUIS) before and her chin felt funny. She added that her blood pressure went up and she had trembles. She felt dizzy.

Lot: ABL8694A, Expiry: Dec2022, It came from another country. She was sure she was allergic to it because she had a rash. That was when she was switched to rivaroxaban.

She was worried and frightened at the time because something happened to her. She can&#39;t remember if her face was swollen. She drank some ice cold water and took two baby aspirins. She knew she needed to flush her system. She just wanted to make she was safe in getting the shot. Her doctor told her to take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) if she ever felt that way. She felt fine after getting the shot and the few days after getting it. She wanted to get the shot. Events resulted in physician office visit. The action taken in response to the events for vitamin D, vitamin b complex, digoxin, rosuvastatin was dose not changed. The outcome of event &#34;She thought she was going to pass out&#34; was unknown.

An 83-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number EL9262, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 20Jan2021, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing allergies (She normally gets an allergy shot for mold and stuff. She had one 8 days prior to getting the vaccine. She has not gotten one since. She is due but she cannot get it until this clears up. She is unsure of the name of the allergy shot that she gets. She had all the allergy tests years ago and has been going for the last 4 years or so. For things like mold, dust, cockroaches, grass, and trees) for which receiving allergy shot, ongoing High blood pressure, ongoing Reflux, and ongoing Osteoporosis/osteopenia. Osteoporosis runs in her family, she does not have it yet but she had Osteopenia (She started young). Concomitant medications included Allergy shot (unspecified) for about 4 years for allergies, valsartan (Started about 5 or 6 years ago) orally at 160 mg, twice a day for high blood pressure, amlodipine (Started about 5 or 6 years ago), orally at 2.5 mg, once a day for High blood pressure, lansoprazole (PREVACID) (Started about 15-20 years ago) orally at 15 mg once a day for Reflux and ibandronate sodium (started about 10 years ago) via an unknown route, at 150 mg once a month for Osteoporosis/osteopenia; all were ongoing. Patient had the first shot of the vaccine last Tuesday. She stayed for half an hour and was fine. She left there and 10 minutes later while driving she started getting itchy around her face mask. She thought it was the mask irritating her skin. As the day progressed her cheeks and under her chin were getting red and itchy. She took Benadryl and the next day it got worse. She called the doctor and they put her on 20mg Prednisone two times a day. That was a week ago Tuesday. She called her allergist and he thought it was the poly glycol peg that is in the vaccine. He will test her after it is all out of her system. Both her regular doctor and her allergist told her not to take the second shot because it was too close a situation. She did not have an anaphylactic reaction, but if she had not jumped on it right away what could have happened. She is wondering if company has any data on the efficacy of the first shot if going on Prednisone right after? She started the Prednisone the next night. She is tapering off now. She still has a little bit of heat on her face and itching under the skin. So, apparently, she had an allergy to the vaccine and was told not to get the second shot. Patient clarified that she did not get the vaccine last Tuesday. She got the vaccine last Wednesday which was 20Jan2021. She said the reaction started about 40-45 minutes after receiving the dose. She has improved about 90% since starting the Prednisone. This morning her face is a little red. She is currently weaning off the Prednisone. Her face was red and it feels a little hot. She is down to 10mg twice a day. She had started the Prednisone the next day on 21Jan2021. She started the wean yesterday. This morning her face is a littler red on her cheeks. The vaccine seems to be taking a long time to get out of her system. NDC, lot, exp are unknown for the Prednisone as it is in a pharmacy vial. Her doctor told her to stop taking Benadryl as it does not stay in the system long enough. She says the Benadryl is not in a bottle, it is in a stupid little package. LOT: SMF001. EXP: May2022. Her doctor put her on Zyrtec twice a day instead. She started that on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.

She informed she was given a &#34;paper&#34; to tell her of the effects that one might possibly have when getting the shot, and then she checked all of those. On 30Jan2021, 2 days after the shot, she was not feeling well. She stated her injection site did have a little pain on Jan2021, but it was okay, it went away the next day. She also had on Jan2021 some tiredness and muscle pain which was on there; other than that, she just has not felt good, just have felt blah. She informed that her lymph nodes were not swollen, and she has not been nauseated or have had any of these things written on the paper. She also informed having read on the paper that &#34;the people with Covid-19 and it gave the symptoms of people with COVID 19 and one of them was loss of taste, and smell was okay&#34;. She then added that after she got her first shot, she noticed once in a while she couldn&#39;t taste anything but that wasn&#39;t all the time. But now, since she got the second shot, it seemed like all day yesterday, 30Jan2021, and this morning also, that she just can&#39;t taste anything. Then she stated &#34;So, my problem is, would that be a result of the shot?&#34; She stated she was feeling a little bit better today other than that, her mouth - she can&#39;t taste anything. Also, yesterday, she took an extra strength Tylenol every 4 hours to try to help with the pain in her arm on Jan2021; but she has not taken any today. She was just trying to help her arm feel better. The outcome of the event injection site did have a little pain was recovered on Jan2021. The outcome of the event she was not feeling well/she just has not felt good, just have felt blah was recovering. The outcome of the event just can&#39;t taste anything was not recovered. While the outcome of all other remaining events was unknown.

She does have rosacea but this was worse.  After she got home she began to feel her heart beating rapidly.  She had taken her medications, but about 6:00 PM she took an extra dose of Metoprolol and waited until about 8:00 PM and the rapid heart beat was still there.  Her son took her BP and it was extremely high and it was 119/68, pulse 112.   At 11:00 her BP was 108/59 with a pulse of 78.   She was able to sleep but did feel heaviness the day later and rapid beating had subsided.   She is still having the rosacea, tingling, stinging of her face.  Her vaccine site was not even sore and he no problems with that.  She called her doctor and the nurse called her back, and she has been trying to call the place where she got the vaccine.  She was told to make sure what to do before she gets the 2nd shot.   She has recovered from the rapid heart beat episode, but the skin stinging of her face is still ongoing.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

An 84-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249) via intramuscular at arm left on 13Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for prevention because of age group. Medical history included hypothyroid diagnosed many years ago, having Covid in Jun2020. Concomitant medications were unknown. The patient was really sick from an unspecified date. The reporter was starting to wonder if the patient should take the second dose. The patient was in bed for 2 days, could not eat and was hurting all over at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021. Her joints were aching at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021.  She had a fever and not really chills, but she just never could get warm and was really cold at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021. She went to bed and woke up on that same date, 13Jan2021, and it started at 11pm.  She guessed it was disabling.  As it went on, it got better. By Friday, she was finally able to eat. She has plenty of weight to fall back on for not eating. By Friday, she started eating again. She was still not back to normal yet though. She just felt like she could not get up. The fever only went on for a few days. Left arm was sore after injection and she had a lump and was itching 13Jan2021. It worried her.  The lump was still itching and sore, but was getting better. Reporter stated that the shingles vaccine did the exact same thing to her with the lump under her skin and itching.  It was given on her hip because she had small arm and they were scared to give it in her arm. The reporter wanted to know if there were elderly people in the trial and did any of them have COVID. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. Seriousness for In bed 2 days was reported as disabling. Seriousness for Could not eat, Fever and really cold was reported as not serious. Seriousness for Left arm sore after injection with lump and itching was reported as medically significant.

She mentioned that she has been at her house ever since last March because of the virus. She hasn&#39;t even been to a grocery store or anywhere. She was given ZYRTEC, PEPCID, and something to put on, it&#39;s Triamcinolone to put on twice a day. She mentioned that Triamcinolone has been helping her since Friday, but now it&#39;s not doing a thing. She was just scratching. Her face was red as a bee and she even got it on her legs and arm. It started on her hands and now, it was going up her arms. This started a week ago (Jan2021). She was suffering from the symptoms, all her feet and legs were covered with white, itch spots and they all go together. She mentioned that she was going to see another doctor tomorrow or go to the hospital or somewhere again. She couldn&#39;t stand this and added that you don&#39;t understand how serious this is. She was supposed to get the second shot tomorrow and mentioned that she was afraid to get it. The patient underwent lab test and procedure which included A1C with an unknown result on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 84-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Covid shot, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history included heart troubles. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication was heart medication. The patient experienced around her neck looks swollen, rash on neck is brown on 03Feb2021 and it was still ongoing and itchy, worried on an unspecified date. Patient stated she read information about a rash all over the body after the COVID vaccine. She has had none of the side effects. She read about severe allergic reactions. She does have a history or heart troubles. She was washing her hair on Wednesday, and she noticed around her neck it looked swollen. Like a little band around her neck. It could have been there before the vaccine. She called her doctor that same day and she said to call Pfizer, and that she thinks she should cancel the second one. She got her first COVID vaccine on 23Jan2021, and she is scheduled for the second 13Feb2021. She does take a heart medication. The place on her neck is not itchy. She knows the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. She sees her dermatologist for Basal cells and other things that are itchy. This place on her neck, if it is a rash, is brown not red. She gets a lot of those places on her skin. Her doctor told her to call Pfizer and then cancel her second appointment. She just wants to speak to medical information first. She doesn&#39;t even know if it is a rash. She hasn&#39;t had any side effects. Her arm didn&#39;t even hurt. This little rash is only on her neck. She had worked as a dental assistant. She is just worried now about getting the second shot. The outcome of event for itchy and worried was unknown and for other events it was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

The Pharmacist had advised her to sit and wait 30 min. after the shot, due to her anaphylaxis history from multiple things. The Pharmacist monitored her and she continued to report itching on the forearm where she got the shot (not around the site) and slight shortness of breath. The patient never appeared to be in distress. As the symptoms continued, the Pharmacist decided, though an Epipen was ready to use, to call 911.  Paramedics arrived within 5 to 7 min., questioned her, took her BP, Oxygen level and listened to her breathing (all were good). She said she was feeling better and said &#34;no&#34; when they asked her if she wanted to go to the hospital. The paramedics stayed with her about 10 minutes longer and she left with her family. She did not receive any Epipen or Benadryl (is allergic to it) but wanted to take a box of Claritin 10 mg with her (said it always helps). The paramedic told her Claritin will not help anaphylaxis (for future). The patient was advised to contact her physician because she probably would be at high risk for a second Covid vaccine.

She had no nausea, or no other symptoms that they talked about. Her skin felt like she had chills bumps from her knees to her shoulders. This has continued since.

She told the person when got the shot that she had Lupus and asked if there was any reason, she should not get this. The nurse talked to somebody and came back and said no it would not affect it. It probably has not. She just wonders if there is something in the injection. She feels like that what caused her to itch since she has not changed her medications at all.

                                                On Thursday evening, after getting the vaccine on Monday, I had a rash on both legs and both arms. It did not break the skin and was not uncomfortable.  I took an Advil PM about an hour before I noticed the rash.  That was 7 days ago, and I still see a light rash on my legs and arms.  It is much better.  No treatments other than taking a couple of Benedryl during that time.

A little white dot appeared where needle was inserted. Arm swelled. Initially thought it was common. But was not getting better and was painful and made her not feel well. She went to the doctors thankfully a few days after and was advised that it was infected. Could have been dangerous for her if infection continued to move through her body.   She is now on antibiotics. This is strange to have an infection which makes us feel the needle was not properly sterilized? Something foreign entered at the time of that shot and we would like to have answers. The doctors could not even identify why this happened.  Company Pfizer..

An 85-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot# EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 09:15 (at the age of 85-years-old) in right arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient had allergies and asthma for years. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported she got her first COVID-19 Vaccine on Saturday, 20Feb2021. She said she developed a rash on Monday (22Feb2021), and was very itchy. She said she didn&#39;t have the rash on her legs. She said she had the feeling of needles all over her entire body and face, along with a hot feeling on 22Feb2021. She said she was contributing her rash to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She asked if she got the second COVID-19 Vaccine, would the rash occur again, and would the rash be worse. The caller said she was scheduled to receive her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose on Thursday, 11Mar2021. The caller was advised she would be transferred to Pfizer Medical Information for further assistance. She had macular degeneration and had difficulty seeing in Feb2021. She clarified she felt like her face had needles going through it. She said her neck, chest, and upper back are a purple-red color on 22Feb2021. She said she was so uncomfortable that it was hard for her to wear clothes, and she had to sleep in the nude. Treatment: she was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and her daughter gave her an over-the-counter cortisone cream in a tube to use for her rash. She said she just started using the cortisone cream today (25Feb2021). She said she did not have the Benadryl and cortisone cream tube with her to provide the UPC/NDC Numbers, Lot Numbers, and Expiration Dates. She planned to call her doctor to see if he will give her something for the rash once she was finished speaking with Pfizer. The events did not require emergency room or physician office. Outcome of macular degeneration and difficulty seeing was unknown, and outcome of other events were not recovered.

                                                fainted; passed out and was unconscious; still kind of feel weak; bruise on both knees; fall; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable registered nurse (patient, Retired RN). An 85-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at single dose via an unknown route injection in left arm on 23Jan2021 around 08:15 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high which was controlled with medication, allergic to penicillin and acetylsalicylic acid;ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN).  She had lost weight and shrunk according to when she went to the doctor 2 months ago. No other products were taken. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect; no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine, no events following prior vaccinations. No family medical history relevant to the events. Patient passed out on her way home on 23Jan2021 (unknown time). The event required a visit to Emergency room, but not a Physician office. The event clinical course was as follows: She got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. Patient reported that after being monitored at the vaccination site for 20minutes, she left to go catch the bus and fainted before boarding the bus.  She remembered getting on the bus, but did not remember crossing the street. She passed out and was unconscious. An ambulance was called and they took her back to the hospital where she got the vaccine. She was taken by ambulance back to the ER, stayed for half the day, she received IV fluids, and a brain scan due to her fall. She stated that she still feels kind of weak as of 29Jan2021.  She did not know what time it happened, because she lost her sense of time on that day because she did not remember. When she got to the hospital she woke up and wondered where she was because she did not remember what happened. They got an x-ray of her head to see if she had bumped it, but it was negative. She did have a bruise on both knees. They gave her IV fluids, and kept her there for a little while, then sent her home. She called her doctor the next day, but he was busy, so she talked to the nurse. No treatment was recommended, just said to get a lot of rest. She was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 13Feb2021 and was scared to death. Patient verified that she was not admitted to the hospital. Investigation assessment were performed. They hooked her up to the monitor, did an x-ray and a CT scan while at the hospital on 23Jan2021 which were normal (both fine), and gave her IV fluids. Outcome of fainted, fall, passed out and was unconscious was resolved on 23Jan2021. Outcome of kind of feel weak was not resolved. Outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainted and unconscious cannot be fully excluded.  The underlying history of high blood pressure for this 85 years old patient  might provide an alternative explanation.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Five days after shot stinging, burning pain, L side front and back from spine below waist around body, into groin area and under stomach, down front of L leg to knee.  Saw doctor on April 5, 2:p.m.  for signs of diverticulitis, given Flagyl and Cipro antibiotics, asked if there was  any rash. There was not.  Pain that evening radiated through entire lower half of body, burning of skin intense.  Went to ER. April 6, before 10:00 a.m., thinking I might have a ruptured diverticuli, for which I had major surgery 4 years prior.  CT scan returned a &#34;mild diverticulitis&#34;.  Rash appeared under skin on L upper thigh on 4/8/21, looking like measles spots.  Called doctor&#39;s office 4/9/21, thinking allergy to antibiotics given for diverticulitis.  My records showed I had been on both before with no reaction; nurse and doctor determined by description and having seen me earlier in the week that it was shingles.

On April 19, patient complained about left shoulder pain and went to see her general practitioner.  Tests were done to rule out heart issues.  On April 20, she called 911 and went to one of the two local hospitals, complaining of shoulder pain.  After an xray, the diagnosis was given as tendonitis and she was sent home and instructed to take 500mg Ibuprofen morning and evening.  On April 23, a rash became apparent on her left arm.  She had a follow-up appointment with her GP on April 27 and was  diagnosed with shingles.  She continued to get more uncomfortable and confused, and late on April 29,  a neighbor took her to the other local hospital where she was admitted.  A lumbar puncture test confirmed that she had herpes zoster virus in the spinal fluid.  She was treated in the hospital with acyclovir by IV and was released from the hospital on May 4 to a skilled nursing facility where she rehabilitated until May 14, when she was sent home.  She continues to be somewhat confused and has difficulty thinking of words - much more so than before her shingles episode.

Caller stated her symptoms were this first of all, she could taste when she first taste something. She did not get the full effect but a pretty good taste but then it gets milder and milder as she continue to taste. Caller questioned if it was a common side effect.

One spot that she had seemed to be itchy again. She said she was not supposed to have salt. She used mustard. She had a sandwich for lunch with mayonnaise, relish, ham, cheese, and lettuce.

Caller stated that she had no problem with smell. She said it was an insidious thing. She did not know when it happened. It was less than a month after 16Feb2021 when she had the second shot. They told her to go to Neurologist. She went to the Neurologist. He told her he did not think it was anything bad. He wanted an MRI to make sure it was not brain tumor. Caller said that she had a Micro Pacemaker inside. Caller said that taste had worsened. Coffee did not taste right, and it went on from there. Caller said the spot was on top of her leg. She could still feel it. It was a lump, little lump (on an unknown date). It did not seem to be itchy anymore. The adverse event requires to visit at Physician Office.

Then, her blood pressure went up to 170, the patient was given lots of continuous water and blood pressure pill. She started to feel better after that. The reporter further stated, &#34;She has had various different problems. I do not know if it is allergies or what from what she already has but she did have a lot of it and exhausting stuff afterwards. There is mainly that choking feeling that is frightening that she had one hour after&#34;. It was also reported that the patient developed some rash on her back and hives on her legs.

A 86-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm (right upper arm) on 03Feb2021 08:50 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history included aspirin exacerbated upper respiratory disease from an unknown date to ongoing and asthma from an unknown date to ongoing and breast cancer. She had family history included diabetes (Father died of a brain hemorrhage at 86). She had historical vaccine as flu vaccine in Oct2020 or Nov2020. There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). There were no concomitant medications. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 03Feb2021, patient experienced itch on her left wrist and injection site was slightly swollen/elevated about 3inches in diameter and about 1 cc high. She stated got the shot today (03Feb2021) and the 2 things she experienced after she got the shot. First she felt an itch on her left wrist immediately but it was given in the right arm. She notes she looked at it and it was red but gradually went down over 15 minutes. Also the injection site was slightly swollen. The itching felt like a pimple when she looked at it she described it as redness that followed the vein and muscle. It lasted about 20 minutes and is back to normal now. At the time, maybe it was swollen. She had been told to stay for half an hour and she did that due to having aspirin exacerbated upper respiratory disease and asthma. She has been a patient in the allergy unit and check with them before getting the shot and was told it was ok to get. It was given about 8:50am. When she got home she looked at the place she was given and it was slightly swollen around the injection site. She always gets shots in right arm due to having breast cancer. It was seen about 10 minutes ago for the first time and was not red but elevated about 3 inches in diameter and about 1 cc high. There was no emergency room or physician office visit. She will be getting amoxicillin when she gets a dental appointment but she has not taken or started that at this point. No treatment was received, she just hung around for a little more than a half hour, showed to the nurse who thought she was ok, she has had no fever or other issues. The caller explained she stayed out of work on Monday and Tuesday to insure she wasn&#39;t upset or getting any infection. She is prone to get sinus infections that affects her ear canals and that cause dizziness. She has had no dizziness. The outcome of event for vaccination site swelling was not recovered and for localised itching it was recovered.

A 86-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL9266; Expiration Date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 18Feb2021 as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL9265, Expiry: 20May2021), dose injection to right arm, not too high up on the shoulder. The patient experienced calling to report pain, weakness to right arm, twisted her knee a little bit/folding chair came down and slammed down onto her knee, deep bruise, she hasn&#39;t gotten the vaccine for shingles, could only remember the itchy thing, problem with her knee on left side on an unspecified date, second dose hurt when it went in on 18Feb2021, arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too on an unspecified date in Mar2021, arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed on an unspecified date in Mar2021. Patient reported that there is a dot where the second dose needle went in her arm. She do not have COVID so assumed she should get it so they could keep living. After the first dose she do not even feel anything, had no reaction to that. The second dose hurt when it went in, but she thought it would go away. So for about 3 weeks she was fine after that. Starting on unknown date in Mar2021, about 3 weeks after she was administered the second dose her arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed. It continued that way. Her arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too which still was not returned totally. Events are ongoing, still every once in a while would come back like a toothache; people say it would go away. She asked the expected duration of events; and if potential third dose is or is not recommended relative to events. Patient thought she was about 5 feet and keeps getting shorter, used to be more than 5 feet tall. But she vacuums, moves things around, trying to do what she should do; but events are continuing and she just wondered how long it would continue yet before it went away. Doctor said they would get a third dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, and she do not know whether she should relative to these events. The reason she got the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine doses in the right arm is because 2 years ago when she got the flu shot patient had a reaction where site was very red; so she thought she was not going to get injection in the left arm again because she is left handed. She knows that not supposed to get other vaccines, so she has not gotten the vaccine for shingles. The harder she tries to remember the worse it is, then she remembered vaccine for shingles. The physician put cortisone in her shoulder because he said it was something else, that he really do not think it was from the shot. She thought well she has had no accident, no fall, no bang, nothing to produce this other than the shot. He looked at it and gave her some exercises to do, so she was going to continue with therapy at the clinic; she goes to see the lady next week. Before all this happened it was going on and on and on. She had a problem with her knee on left side which the doctor looked at during that appointment. After the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was administered, about 6 weeks ago she was working out in the yard. She do not think it had anything to do with the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included x-ray: unknown results on unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of calling to report pain, weakness to right arm, second dose hurt when it went in, arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too, twisted her knee a little bit/folding chair came down and slammed down onto her knee, deep bruise, arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed, arm just reacted strangely, she hasn&#39;t gotten the vaccine for shingles, could only remember the itchy thing, problem with her knee on left side. The seriousness of the events was medically significant. The clinical outcome of arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too, deep bruise were recovering, of the arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed were not recovered, of the calling to report pain, weakness to right arm, hurt when it, second dose hurt when it went in, twisted her knee a little bit/folding chair came down and slammed down onto her knee went in, she hasn&#39;t gotten the vaccine for shingles, could only remember the itchy thing and problem with her knee were unknown.

                                                Patient developed dizziness and weakness. She did not totally pass out because she made it to her chair and did not fall on the ground. She described her vision going black. She said that she did not eat today at her normal times which could have contributed to the event. She is asking if the vaccine could have had anything to do with this?  She has not had a previous episode like this before. She did have some minor injection site pain at the time of the vaccine but that has subsided.  Follow-up call with patient on 1/30/31 at 19:37: Spoke to the patient. She is feeling better today.  She did not see her doctor or go to the ED. She checked her glucose yesterday and it was high. She said she thinks her symptoms were from not eating her normal meals around the time of the vaccine.

An 87-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was none.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated she had this injection 08Jan2021, states the following Thursday, 14Jan2021, she broke out with 2 different reactions, a rash that looks like measles all over, the second reaction is part on her back looks like a little kid has not had their diaper changed, like diaper rash, like half a belt from the right side to the back. States she is very concerned, the patient went to a dermatologist who she had a lot of faith in, doctor met her at the door, read about it but has never seen a reaction like this. States that they injected her with something and it worked in two different places. States she did a biopsy on her hip and took movies to show her students, called her and stated she need to report this event. The patient states she wants to know if she should get the second vaccine. States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine. The patient last night to report but she could not get through. Stated she got injection on right arm. The patient stated the rashes are trying to improve. States the rash that looks like measles started on the right side and now is all over. The patient stated she is allergic to bromines and swims in a bromine salt water heated swimming pool and this has nothing to do with it but the point she is saying is that she says your allergic to things and then not have reactions and sometimes you do. Both events were serious with criteria of medially signicant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included biopsy: unknown results, body height: 5 foot 2 inches (States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine).  The outcome of the event rash that looks like measles was not recovered, while the outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.

Per patient&#39;s wife/caregiver, patient appeared anxious, skin color appeared abnormal, and pulse was weak and bradycardic (not unusual for patient). Albuterol nebulizer treatment attempted but patient was too anxious to complete. Gave 2 puffs albuterol oral inhaler, and repeated treatment 15 min later followed by a small glass of cola. About 30min later patient calmed, no longer short of breath and pulse strong but face remained flushed. Vitals at 9:20pm included BP 116/47, pulse 67. Following day patient had multiple involuntary diarrheal stools. Symptoms reported to provider 2/8 and noted to be resolved.

                                                Patient reported dizziness and a fainting episode the morning after her immunization. She knew she was getting dizzy and she attempted to get into her recliner, but fell into her recliner and injured her rib and possibly her &#39;tailbone&#39;. She went to the Emergency Department  where she was examined and scans were taken of her ribs. She was determined to have &#39;bruised&#39; ribs and sent home with advice to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen alternately every 4 hours for pain relief. She has been at home since this episode. We only found out about this adverse event this week when we called her to confirm her second immunization. She reported this fall to us and was reluctant to get the second shot. I reported the event to her provider, and now to you at VAERS.

Started to experience pins and needles in her right hand since late Wednesday - the same arm that the injection was in.  Now she is noticing some blisters on her right hand, those she noticed today. The following day of the injection the pain was so severe to the right arm from the shoulder all the way down the arm unable to lift the arm or movement. Pain is improving today .  Still has the blisters to the hand.    Pain in right shoulder and across the back of her neck - all on the right side. Used Tylenol and Lidocream OTC - helped very temporarily.   Also had fatigue lasting about a day and a half.

Two nights later the same thing happened on my right foot.  Several of my toes ended up with scabs on the tips of the toes.  My dermatologist told me that my toes had hemmouraged on the inside and the scabs were a result of that.  She had not seen anything like that.

An 87-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), on an unspecified date (Lot: EN5318) as 1 st dose, single then on 27Feb2021 (Lot: EL9260) as 2 nd dose, single; both via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (at the age of 87-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood cholesterol, hypertension, heartburn and very small outbreak of shingles (35-40 years ago). Concomitant medications included amlodipine for hypertension; losartan for hypertension; omeprazole for heartburn and simvastatin for cholesterol. The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient had reaction after the second shot was shingles on 11Mar2021. The patient had shingles virus obviously in her system, viruses remain dormant, like that in the system. So her virus shingles was in her system. The patient&#39;s child guessed 35-40 years ago when she had a very small outbreak of shingles and then this time after the second shot it came on pretty severe all around her back, fore and front of the upper chest. The patient&#39;s child wanted to make sure that this was reported because he/she did think there was relation to it and think that people have them reporting the same thing. The patient&#39;s child stated, &#34;She still has some facing from it I mean the shingles, I have not asked it anymore but she still has the after nerve sensation, you know that you get after shingles, yes; she still has some of the nerve sensation. That&#39;s common after shingles.&#34; On treatment for event, the patient&#39;s doctor called in a liquid medication that she took for a week for shingles, didn&#39;t have that name and bottle, also prescribed the pill that she could take in the evening if she need before bed called gabapentin was for when she had the nerve pain obviously standing on virus after shingle taken as needed prior to bed. Well the liquid was for to address the shingle that they were after shingle and the gabapentin was for her to take when she had that nerve pain obviously standing from the shingles virus, taken as needed prior to that. The outcome of the events was recovering.

An 87-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number and Expiry Date: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 28Jan2021 about 15:00 ( at the age of 87-years) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included allergy to penicillin. Patient had no concomitant medications. There was no history of any previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect nor any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks or additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect vaccines. After vaccination, the patient was doing fine until around 13Feb2021 when she started really itching, red spots one on each finger and each arm, nausea, and can&#39;t really sleep. The events did not require any emergency room or physician office visit or hospitalization. No relevant tests were done. She was due to receive her second dose of vaccine on 19Feb2021. She asked if this was normal side effect and whether she should receive her 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine if she suspects a non-immediate allergic reaction about a week later. Outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 07:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, bypass in 2010, hearing is very bad on the phone, arthritis pain, headache, and blood thinner. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included metoprolol for hypertension, quinapril for hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) for hypertension, ascorbic acid/ calcium/ minerals NOS/ retinol/ tocopheryl acetate/ vitamin B NOS/ vitamins NOS/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER), calcium carbonate (CALTRATE), atorvastatin, warfarin as blood thinner, spironolactone, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) for arthritis pain and headache; all were ongoing. The patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and had reactions to the vaccine or something else. That day, the patient&#39;s left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain), but that was expected, and it went away within 2 days (initially didn&#39;t report it because it was expected). Yesterday (18Jan2021), the patient experienced dizziness and pain in the lower extremities. Last night (18Jan2021; about 6 days after the injection), the patient woke up, felt poorly, and was very dizzy (feeling of dizziness), then, later on, had pain in both lower extremities. The patient took her blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly with result of 159. The patient&#39;s heart rate, temperature, and pulse oximetry were okay on 18Jan2021. She then walked to the bathroom, came back, and went back into bed. The second time she said her legs hurt but this morning she is feeling better than she was. Today (19Jan2021), the pain in feet is better, and the dizziness is gone. Pulse oximetry and temperature were okay this morning (19Jan2021). The patient was wondering if these effects could be related to the vaccine, since the dose was received 6 days ago. The patient was not sure if could possibly be related to the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was that she spent a lot of time doing paperwork on the computer yesterday (18Jan2021) and perhaps that caused some of the symptoms. The patient&#39;s sister called to ask if Pfizer has heard of any late adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccine like this patient&#39;s, 6 days later. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 04Feb2021 (day 22) and her sister asked what if it&#39;s not available. The patient&#39;s sister was concerned about interval and potentially being unable to gain access to the second dose due to supply issues. The patient recovered from &#34;Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain)&#34; on 15Jan2021; and from &#34;Dizziness&#34; on 19Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the other events.

An 88-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 11:45 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung cancer. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient had unspecified other medication in two weeks. The reporter&#39;s mother&#39;s experienced mild allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she wants to know whether or not she should be getting her second dose. She will be asking her doctor as well as they were advised by the nurse administering the vaccine and also the doctor&#39;s nurses who observed her mother afterwards, but she was also advised to contact Pfizer. On 20Jan2021, at 12:00, within 5 minutes, the patient experienced flushed in the face/warm, red face, tingling sensation of lips but no swelling, no increased blood pressure, no hives or rash, no tongue or throat swelling, no dizziness, no nausea. It was mild but concerning. The patient was treated with oral Benadryl and Pepcid IV (also reported as IV of peptids), and extended observation for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had no Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The consumer would like to know if her mother was safe to receive the second dose of the Covid vaccine and if the reaction to the second dose of the Covid vaccine will be more severe with a history of an allergic reaction to the first dose. Outcome of event mild allergic reaction was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was recovered in Jan2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                My mother had an &#34;adverse event&#34; to the first dose of the Covid-19 PFIZER  mRNA vaccine. Her whole upper arm became swollen (inflammation) and somewhat &#34;hot to the touch&#34; and was reddish in coloring. The inflammation did NOT look like a golf ball, but rather like a small hill on her upper arm, with a slope. After that, she reported to me .... that she was getting &#34;winded&#34;, on walks with her best friend. They both live in a senior citizen residence center, which is NOT an &#34;assisted living&#34; facility. Now, the swelling (inflammation) is gone. My mother has now had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and yesterday .... she did NOT report, any adverse reactions (yet) from her second injection.

She stated that the second one made her really sick. This sickness was getting too long. Her second dose of the vaccine was on 05Mar2021. She was so tired; stated she doesn&#39;t feel good. She stated that she felt like she has long haulers all over again, it was horrible. Stated she felt like she shouldn&#39;t have gotten the second one. States she was doing okay with first one. Caller states that she already gave up a whole year of her life because of this. She tried to call before, but she didn&#39;t wait to talk to someone, she had to go somewhere. The patient stated that she had hives, tiredness, problems with her intestines, got really sick, her skin and eyes started to burn, she felt like she had hives all over, her skin was burning, she was sweating and felt hot, stated on the 14th it really got bad, her whole body was hot and itching. States that she took a BENADRYL and felt better the next 2 days and then started getting sinuses and nose plugged up and it hurt when she was breathing, had a slight fever, and her skin was itchy. She states that she went to doctor on 15Mar2021 (physician office visit), and he didn&#39;t think too much of it because her oxygen was okay. States that she felt worse, she was coughing bad, felt terrible, her muscles ache, and when she was hot, she couldn&#39;t sleep, now all she wanted to do was sleep and she had fever and chills. She was supposed to do exercises, but she couldn&#39;t, and it started two days ago. States she was not coughing as much but it was still hard and hurting. It was some of her joints, not all of her joints were hurting like when she had long haulers. Fever and chills started when her sinuses started acting up. The fever and chills kept getting occasional slips in and out. Her fever was not high but enough to get the chills. Sinuses and nose plugged up: it came and went with MUCINEX and it helped a little. Her intestinal problems were diarrhea that started on 08Mar2021 and upset stomach. She had a problem and it hurt terrible for days after. No appetite lasted for one week, so probably ended 15Mar2021. Caller states that she felt a little better but can&#39;t get rid of her cough. Couldn&#39;t Sleep: started when she had the burning and lasted a little after because she had to get herself together again. She could only sleep three hours at time. Skin and Eyes Burning and Itching: The burning and itching went away for a while, but it was back again because she had been lying in bed and tired, stated that it was not so bad. The burning stopped 15Mar2021 when the hives were gone, but she stated that right now it was back, her skin gets hot and then starts burning and itching. Patient stated that she did not have too much problems with first but this second, oh my god. She thought she got it too soon after having long haulers. She got rid of that in Jan2021 and was feeling good but now she felt terrible again. States there were no tests, she didn&#39;t have any. She was so weak, and she was having a hard time now, and she was doing so good. She was worried about her heart and valves. She guessed that call handler couldn&#39;t help her either, she stated that she didn&#39;t know what to do to feel better. She thought she had better call and report it. She has already gone to doctor and had only gone to him for 2 years, but hopefully he knew enough about her. She states that she probably should call him because she wasn&#39;t getting any better. The outcome for hives at injection site/hives all over was recovered on 15Mar2021, skin and eyes burning and itching/her whole body is hot and itching was not recovered, muscle soreness was not recovered, weakness was not recovered, cough was not recovered, tiredness was not recovered, joint pain was not recovered, fever chills was not recovered, sinuses and nose plugged up was unknown, diarrhea and upset stomach; stomach hurting was recovered on 11Mar2021, hurts to breathe was recovering , couldn&#39;t sleep was unknown, no appetite was recovered on 15Mar2021, sickness was unknown, sweating and felt hot was not recovered , sinuses and nose plugged up was unknown, skin and eyes burning and itching was not recovered, sweating and felt hot was not recovered.

An 89-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 13Jan2021 10:35 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Ongoing medical history heart failure, kidney failure, scoliosis and strained hernia (causing pain down her right leg). Other medical history includes patient gave up her car and as a result she went from 5ft 4 inches to 5ft 1 inch and went from 150 pounds to 106 pounds (stated she loves this new weight. She looks fabulous and wonderful in clothes). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient was a retired school teacher, called about the shot, the vaccine, clarified as the COVID Vaccine. She mentioned she has a history of heart failure, kidney failure, scoliosis, and hernias. She was concerned about getting the vaccine and did not think she should get it, but her doctor informed her she should get it so she did. Since getting it she is having a hard time. Stated it feels like lead. She contacted her doctor and was informed to wait it out 24 hours and it would be a lot better. It was reported that the patient got the COVID Vaccine shot yesterday (13Jan2021 10:35). She mentioned her arm is hurting so bad. She contacted her doctor&#39;s office and was informed to give it another 24 hours for the pain to go away. It was reported that the patient hurts so bad, she hurts all over. She added she guesses the arm where she got the injection in is like equalizing the pain she has. She stated as soon as she got the injection everything was wonderful. It was afterwards she felt like she could not move her arm, her left arm. She felt like at first she was having a stroke. She did some self testing and was happy she realized she was not having a stroke. It was reported that the patient provided conflicting details of when arm hurting started. She initially stated it started 13Jan2021. She then stated she did not feel it until 8am in the morning of 14Jan2021 (pending clarification) when she could not move her arm and thought she was having a stroke. She commented she sleeps every 2 hours. She would later mention in report she felt the arm pain starting yesterday (as reported).

                                                Patient received second vaccine dose and felt well without significant symptoms in the days following.  Then, on 2/19 she developed epistaxis, brusining, and petechiae.   She had labs drawn by a local provider and platelet count was 7.   (baseline, even on chemotherapy for her AML is in the normal range).   Therefore, she reported to a local health center and a recheck of the platelet count was &lt;3k.     WBC and Hb were within normal range.   No circulating blasts or other evidence of AML.  No recent infections or other exposures.   That center reached out for transfer to our hospital as we initially diagnosed and treated her AML.  I advised dexamethasone 40mg and transfer (they also transfused 5u platelets prior to her departure)  Upon arrival at our center about 12hrs later, platelet count was 210 and on 2 rechecks it has remained in the normal range while continuing dexamethasone 40mg daily.   Bleeding symptoms ceased and she was discharged in stable condition.  She plans to return back to home after discharge with repeat lab testing later this week after stopping steroids.   Chemotherapy to be held at least one extra week to ensure stability.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 89-years-old female patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (by injection once to left arm) on 22Jan2021 COVID-19 immunization since patient was in an independent facility with 238 residents. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. She said she got her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on a Friday. She said she had no pain in her arm after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, but then on 26Jan2021 she noticed about 8 hives right at her waist line. She asked if the hives were a reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her skin was red and puffy in 8 different places on her waistline. She said her skin on her waistline looks like what happens when being allergic to something. She said she lives in an independent living community, and the COVID-19 Vaccine was provided to the residents in a group setting. She said no COVID-19 Vaccine immunization cards were provided at the time of vaccination. Patient reported &#34;you know when the person gets hives, you get blisters, red blisters and now they are getting worse&#34; and asked if that was a side effect from the vaccine.&#34; She was fine for a couple days, then noticed, and she doesn&#39;t know if this is a side effect or not, the waistline, she has about 5, states &#34;you know when a person gets hives in the skin, it is raised and red? Is that a side effect?&#34; States she shrunk (onset date not reported). There was a doctor there she would see her week and would show her, she will be giving her a physical. Patient would try to get physical therapy there. She further stated it looks like hives, she was looking now, she has 8 hives, they were the same color, and it was also itchy. She was not given a vaccine card. She was brought into a dining room, one area aside, there was a nurse, and applications already filled out, she has no idea what her number was, but after the injection she was put in another room, and sat for 15 minutes, to make sure no reaction, and there wasn&#39;t, she had no pain in arm, she felt well, but this showed up. She has to go back in 3 weeks for second injection. No investigation assessment was performed. The outcome of shrunk was unknown and not recovered (ongoing) for the other events. Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

On 2/20/21, patient received a first dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine 30 mcg/0.3 mL IM x 1 (lot# EL9261; left arm). Was seen in ED c/o back pain and bruising.  On admission Platelets=3k and Hgb=8.6.  Patient treated for Evans syndrome: ITP and hemolytic anemia. Patient received 1 units platelets, IVIG 55gm IV daily x 2 days, Rituximab 560mg IV weekly x 4 (1 dose given during this admission), dexamethasone 40mg IV x 4 days followed by a prednisone taper. Per hematology, &#34;spontaneous development of warm atuimmune hemolytic anemia as well as ITP is of unclear etiology. No malignancy has been isolated. There are some rare case reorts of ITP from COVID vaccination. Ultimately, we cannot prove whether this is due to the COVID vaccine.&#34;  Patient was counseled to not undergo the second dose of COVID vaccine.

An 89-year-old-female patient received 1st dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL8982) on 21Jan2021 10:15 am on Left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunization; second dose (Lot number: EM9809) on 11Feb2021 10:15 am on Left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure (diagnosed maybe 30 years before, ongoing), high cholesterol (diagnosed maybe 30 years before, ongoing), low thyroid (it&#39;s low thyroid and was diagnosed maybe 25 years before, ongoing). For Concomitant products, Caller states she&#39;s on a lot of medications. Caller said that she and her daughter had developed hives after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She wanted to know if that could be a reaction from the vaccine. She also wanted to know how long it would last. Caller wanted to know if the hives she has can be transmitted to her daughter. Caller states hives started about 2 or 3 months before, she received the vaccine in Feb2021 and hives started in Feb2021 (as reported). States she is on medications (Caller states she&#39;s taking Tagamet and there is another name for it but that is the generic that she&#39;s been taking. States she&#39;s been taking it since 2 months ago) so it&#39;s improved. Clarified with caller that she experienced hives after the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine (as reported). No Emergency Room visit. Caller states she went to the doctor&#39;s office for hives. Outcome of the event was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed.

                                                shingles; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration, by injection once to the left deltoid on 21Jan2021 at the age of 89-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced shingles on 07Feb2021. The patient reported that she had the first dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE last 21Jan2021 and she had shingles. The doctor advised that she could have the 2nd dose on 22Feb2021 instead of 11Feb2021, which was 3 weeks later after the 1st dose. The patient wanted to know if she will take her doctor&#39;s advice to have the 2nd dose later than 3 weeks since she was now getting better. The patient wanted to know how long after the shingles go away can she get the second vaccine. The patient reported that she had shingles after having 4 shingles vaccine shots. The first was when it first came out, the second she thinks has been about 1.5 years ago. She would have to check records on that. She hasn&#39;t been out of the country. The patient reported that she thinks her shingles was better. She was on an antiviral drug valaciclovir (VALTREX). When reading the vaccine paperwork, the patient stated she has a hard time reading. The shingles was on her face and her eye was affected. Having had all the vaccines, this took her by surprise. There was no investigation assessment. The outcome of the event was recovering.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program COVAX US Support received from a contactable consumer (patient). An 89-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9267), administered in left arm, on 02Mar2021 (at the age of 89-years-old) at 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure, black and blue at the area of the blood work, whole arm was black and blue. Concomitant medications included metoprolol taken from 2021 (about a month prior the report, as reported) at 25 mg for blood pressure; amlodipine taken from an unspecified date (started taking it many years prior the report, she said at least 8 years, as reported) at 5 mg for blood pressure. The vaccination provider had difficulty with the needle and her skin had black and blue since that day, she had not experienced any other side effect. The patient read somewhere that in older people the vaccine was not as effective, her doctor told her that the black and blue was a result of being mistreated, and she had also heard that this should not happen. The black and blue was getting lighter, she saw some yellow as in bruises, when she took a blood test her whole arm was black and blue. She would like to know if this was normal or if she was &#34;the first one in the history to report this&#34; and if her injection was effective and if it had full effect. She continued to state the operator that gave her the vaccine had difficultly administering it to her as a result the operator started prodding her and the injection area was then black and blue. It did not hurt her, well it did hurt when he did it, and she told him that. She used ice on the area but everyone she had shown said &#39;oh my God that was not normal she should go see a doctor&#39;. She did not have any after effects, she was fine, all symptoms listed she did not have any of them other than the black and blue arm. She was starting to get concerned because it had been so many days. She mentioned it was getting yellow at the time of the report. She was concerned that the vaccine was ineffective or it was effective and something was wrong. Patient stated the black and blue area resembled something like when she got a blood test and the operator had difficulty, she continued to report that sometimes she would be black and blue at the area of the blood work and that sometimes her whole arm would be black and blue. She continued to speak about her concern with the black and blue area, she stated she worried, was the vaccine going to work ok because of this. She thought it was import and that it was such a peculiar thing. She had spoken to her doctor and pharmacist, they felt it was just a black and blue area that would go away but she was concerned because it had been so many days and she felt it should have resolved by this time. She did not take any ASPIRIN or acetaminophen, because they said not to. She was concerned that the vaccine was ineffective or it was effective and something was wrong, due to the event that she was experiencing. Injection site was black and blue. The patient was recovering from the events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.
