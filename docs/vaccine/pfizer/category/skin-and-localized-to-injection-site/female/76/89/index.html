                                                Approximately 1 hour after the shot, I raised a hive on my upper lip.  It very quickly (within 2 minutes) got to its maximum size.  Not noticeably swollen to an observer, but it felt swollen, red and throbbing. It was not a serious adverse reaction.  After about an hour, it was NOT going away, but it was NOT getting worse.  I never experienced trouble breathing. The office where I had the shot is &#34;not available&#34; on Friday afternoon, and my personal physician is not in the office on Friday.  I was advised by another doctor friend to take benadryl, which I did.  While looking at the CDC website, he also advised me that (having had this reaction) I should not receive the second shot.

                                                Four hrs. after getting the vaccine.  My face started itching, could feel welts under the skin.  Swelling of the right side of my face started within a few hours later.  Called Drs. , He recommended taking Tylenol.  (Second Day) Next day, felt short of breath, weak, applied ice packs to my face. Third day, felt weak.  By the fourth day, swelling and itching subsided; but skin on my face felt gritty under the skin. Drove me to the doctor&#39;s office the third day.  I was short of breath walking from the car to the door to the doctor&#39;s office.  I was wearing my mask.  I saw a PA; but, she didn&#39;t tell me much of anything.  I don&#39;t think she knew what to say.

I didn?t feel well that afternoon sneezing because I thought it was nothing. As the week went on I started sneezing and coughing and stopped up nose. I always end up with sinus infection when I get a cold Dec 28 I went to the doctor at doctors care and they did a covid test before the doctor would see I tested positive.  I went home and rested, no energy, felt like I was hit by a train, couldn?t breathe, sneezed a lot and hardly coughed.  January 1, I called ambulance and went to hospital, I was sick the first week of January.  I didn?t know that you should wait 90 days to get the vaccine after you?ve had Covid.  After I got the vaccination the adverse reaction, I woke up during the night with my arm hurting bad and throbbing and a very large red circle appeared on my arm 2? in diameter. The next 3 days I felt like I had covid all over again, the 4th day I woke up and felt a little better and got out of bed and started making progress each day. Now I?m not good, but I?m ok.

I applied Hydrocortisone cream USP, 2.5% to area and bandaged that night, and the next morning it appeared to be a rash.  Reapplied ointment and  rebandaged after shower every morning since then, through today 2/3/2021 It appears to be itching her and causing her to scratch until  ointment is applied. No improvement so far.

I had severe diarrhea and my bowels are still messed up- they are light yellow verging on white. I have been having migraines  and am very weak and shaky. Pain at injection site is trivial. Pain through out my body is not. I am often dizzy.

Appearance of skin is rash, welted, red, bruised and sensitive to touch in an area about 3x3 inches. OTC anti itch cream not effective. Itching became so severe, I went to my dermatologist 3 days after itching started. Diagnosed as Allergic Contact Dermatitis due to Covid 19 vaccine. Given Rx anti itch cream and told to use cold pack when it was itchy and take OTC antihistamine. Followed doctor&#39;s orders and itching finally stopped after 12 days from onset.

                                                headache; she had a mild soreness in her left arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient) via a Pfizer-sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. This pharmacist reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 10:30 AM at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in jaw and headache. Concomitant medication included Tylenol for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw. The patient (retired pharmacist) stated that she and her husband got the COVID shot on Tuesday (19Jan2021) and prior to getting the vaccine, she was suffering temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw and took Tylenol that morning. Patient just came back from urgent care and was prescribed a dose pack of prednisone to take for 5 days for the TMJ and she is concerned about taking it because she knows it can suppress the immune system and she does not want to make the vaccine less effective. She was trying to figure out if she should just tough it out and not take the steroid. She and her husband, who was on warfarin, had a mild headache after the first shot but he has sinus issues and she had the TMJ, they were not sure if the headaches were from those things or the vaccine. Patient asked if she can take Tylenol since she found out that that may not have been a good idea. She was advised to take Prednisone and she was asking if she can take it or will it affect the efficacy of the vaccine. She stated not knowing that taking Tylenol can effect the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine, she had taken Tylenol before she received her COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021 (Tuesday). Patient said her TMJ jaw pain was still a problem after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine, so she had gone to her doctor, and her doctor prescribed Prednisone, a corticosteroid. She said she was not going to take the Prednisone because she does not want the Prednisone to cause an issue with the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said she then read that studies performed on children said that children that took Tylenol did not get as good of an immune response from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said since she already took a dose of Tylenol for her TMJ jaw pain before receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, she was afraid to take any further Tylenol. Patient clarified that the Tylenol she took was the generic Equate brand, 500mg. She said she took 2 Equate brand generic Tylenol 500mg for jaw pain on Tuesday morning (19Jan2021) prior to getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she had disposed of Equate brand generic Tylenol bottle and cannot provide the UPC, Lot and Expiration Date. Reported that both her and her husband did have a headache all day long after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her husband believes his headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was not sure if her headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine or from her TMJ jaw pain. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she usually has a headache accompanying the TMJ jaw pain. Also reported that she always gets her vaccines in her left arm. Patient was surprised she and her husband did not have anything more than a headache after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said when she had the Shingles Vaccine, she could not lay on her left side for a week because her arm was so sore for 2 days, and when she had the flu shot she could not get out of bed for a day. Patient clarified she got her first dose of the Shingrix Shingles Vaccine in Nov2020, and does not plan to go and get her second Shingrix dose until the summer of 2021. Patient stated that she does not want the second dose of the Shingrix Vaccine interfering with the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient had headache on 19Jan2021, reported as mild. Patient also had a mild soreness in her left arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021, and the left arm soreness was gone in less than 24 hours. Patient further clarified that she had a headache before getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her TMJ jaw pain acts up if she eats. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she gets an excruciating headache. She said she has no headache pain at all right no. Patient expected to have kind of a worse reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine based on what other people have been saying. The events were assessed as non-serious. Outcome of the event headache and mild soreness in her left arm  was recovered in Jan2021. Patient does not think her headache pain was related to the COVID-19 Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association and drug&#39;s safety profile, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event headache cannot be totally excluded. The underlying temporomandibular joint and headache may be cofounders.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082288 same drug/reporter, similar events, different patient

                                                One week after the first vaccine, I had severe pain in my right arm.  I could barely lift it. applied ice and pain lessened...Then other events followed...My left wrist became swollen and red. then a day later the severe pain was in my left arm and I could barely lift it.  I then had a swollen right foot.  Podiatrist gave me a shot of cortisone but continued to have the pain and swelling...Shoulder pain returned.   2nd vaccine was 02/03/2021...Feb 10...both hands were stiff and I couldn?t open them...Then the shoulder pain in my right arm returned .  This lasted 4 days...with the most severe pain.

I went to bed around 11:30 and didn&#39;t sleep very well.  On Wed. am after going to the bathroom, I felt woozy while washing my hands.  When I thought I felt better, I made my way back to the bedroom and passed out.  I fell on my right side, bruising the right side of my face, my right hip and my right thigh.  I apparently had my left hand under me when I fell because I broke the knuckle under the pinkie of my left hand.

                                                I started noticing small blisters on my right lower leg on shin area that were very itchy.  Day by day I noticed an incease of clusters of blisters forming below the first site.  They then circled from front to back halfway up my lower leg.  Large whelpy itchy places continued to form on my upper forearms and back of right arm elbow.  Then the same effects started on my left leg on the back side between my knee and ankle.  I have now a large circular area on my lower back at the waistline with solid itchy hard bumps that has increased in size and discomfort.  I have red itchy blisters on both my left and right uper wrists.  I am noticing small clrcular bumps on my right and left forehead.

Was given instructions to take 40 mg of Prednisone first day and taper off, 2-3 doses of antihistamine and Hydrocortisone on welts.  Needed to go to ER for IV if face swelling did not go down.

Doctor diagnosed infection as cellulitis,  and prescribed doxycycline 100mg for 5 days. Because of the underlying primary immune deficiency,  this will be a difficult adverse event to overcome. First noticed on February 25, 2021. Covid-19 vaccine was administered on Monday February 22nd 2021.

                                                Within 8 hours of the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle weakness (could not lift arms above head; could not stand from sitting position without pain). During night, could not turn over in bed without pain. This lasted for 3-4 days. Treated with Advil. Next symptoms were joint pains and stiffness and back pains, which also lasted about a week. Treated with Aleve and hot/cold compresses. Final symptoms are severe swelling and stiffness of hands and fingers, with cracked, peeling skin. I have had this for about a week now and it is not improving. Cannot grasp anything with either hand. Middle and index fingers on both hands useless.

                                                pustules across her back; In her throat she is getting hoarse; itching with the rash; rash that is all over her body; splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist /Two splotches on right hand side; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information Team. A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 26Jan2021 at 14:19 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no previous immunizations. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date. Medical history included allergic to penicillin, bladder infection, in the middle of her chest she had the pain cling through her back, and thyroid getting lazy and does not work. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid getting lazy and does not work, vitamins, and sulfa drugs for bladder infection. It was reported that after getting the first dose of the vaccine the patient noticed she had pustules across her back on an unspecified date. The patient stated she &#34;got this rash from the tips of fingers, even the palm of my hands and it starts right under the neck and goes across my breast, on my belly, on my back and both arms and is now halfway down my shin bone.&#34; On an unspecified date in Jan2021, she noticed this the afternoon of her vaccine around 7:00 when she saw two splotches on her stomach and it kept spreading. Sunday morning she went to Quick Care and yesterday went to her regular doctor. Her doctor gave her prednisone to take 10 mg 4 times a day, and hydroxyzine 10 mg for itching. In her throat she was getting hoarse on an unspecified date and was keeping a water bottle on her desk to keep hydrated. She stated she read on (website) that a rash can be a symptom of the vaccine. The caller asked, &#34;if the pustules burst will this cause anyone to get Covid 19? Is this a possible side effect of the vaccine? How long will this last? Is it okay to get my second shot with this reaction? Is there anything I should be taking to make it go away?&#34; It was further reported that patient received paperwork to call if there was any type of reaction. The patient mentioned she has a rash that was all over her body on 28Jan2021. It was on the top of her hands, in the palm of her hands, on her arms, back, under her breast, on her chest, on her stomach, on her bottom end, it was going down her legs and to her knees at this point. The patient initially stated she noticed the rash on Friday (29Jan2021), she later stated it was Thursday 28Jan2021 when the rash first started. She stated she first noticed splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist on an unspecified date in Jan2021. At first when looking at it she did not think too much about it. Later in the call she further clarified and stated it was possible she noticed these splotches the same day in the evening on the day she got the vaccine. She was not sure. If it was not the same day it was the next day. Friday (29Jan2021), she started to get as initially stated bumps, but later clarified rash under skin and it really proceeded from there. Additionally, it was reported that the rash continued to spread throughout her whole body. It was down to her shin now. Her whole upper body was horrible. She has some across her back. There are pustules on them like a pimple. It was like water in it ready to break. Sunday she went to a (clinic name) to get it looked at. She went Sunday 31Jan2021. She was given an intravenous (IV) and three needles were placed in it. She knows one was a steroid, she does not know what the other two were for, but she thinks one was probably for itching. The patient also confirmed she also experienced itching with the rash on 28Jan2021. It started the same day she noticed the rash. The patient stated it was like a full blown case now. The itching was with the rash on 28Jan2021. The itching and rash has continued to go down her body. It was on her buttocks now. It was hard to sit. It was in private up between her legs and stuff. Her body was almost 80 % full and covered with this stuff. She saw her regular doctor yesterday. The doctor at (clinic name) thought this reaction may have been an allergic reaction to a Sulfa drug she was taking for a bladder infection coincidentally at the same time, but she does not believe this was the case. Stated she had taken that sulfa drug before previously. She does not have the name of the drug to provide of the sulfa drug. She does not have it with her. No blood work was done. She was just looked at. They saw what was going on. The patient also mentioned she went on the internet to do research. She saw on Pfizer page three pictures that resembled what she had going on. It was also reported that the two splotches on right hand side started about 7&#39;clock in the evening. At first did not think anything of it. Thought it was possibly a bug bite at first. Additionally, it was reported that patient went to see a doctor. She was already going to the doctor for a bone density scan and she showed the doctor what was going on at the same time. Her primary doctor thought this was due to the COVID 19 Vaccine. At end of call, patient questioned &#34;if the pustules across upper back and behind neck, will that cause anyone to get COVID 19? Side effect?&#34; The patient had no emergency visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of itching with the rash, rash that is all over her body, and two splotches on right hand side. The patient had not yet recovered from rash that is all over her body while outcome of the events pustules, itching with the rash, in her throat she is getting hoarse, and &#34;splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist /Two splotches on right hand side&#34; was unknown.

                                                Day of shot at 5:00 pm my palms on both hands had itching and I had to keep scratching them. It was driving me nuts. Later that evening my feet were also itching. All night long and into Tuesday but the itching also included my underarms, chest, and upper thighs. Finally on Tuesday I started taking 2 Benedryl tablets every 6 hours, however at 4 hours the itching came back but seemed to be only on the upper body. It is now a little over 72 hours since my shot and I&#39;m still suffering the itching, but not quite as bad with Benedryl. Since I didn&#39;t see this on the list of possible side effects, I thought you should know.

It was reported that patient had rash or hives are on her legs, thighs, neck, back, and head on an unknown date in Feb2021. The reporter told that the rash was not getting worse, and Benadryl seems to help it.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rash, rash or hives are on her legs, thighs, neck, back, and head. The outcome of the event fever was unknown while for other events was recovering.

When I got up to take a Motrin I was disorientated. Did not know where I was. .   Next day experienced several sudden feelings a syncopye.  Lasting a few seconds. Had to grab on to something due to a feeling that I was going to fall. It lasted just a quick second or two.  Happened several times that day.  Like what I would think a TIA would feel like.  Arm was just slightly tender and stinging the first day,.  In the night it was aching and hot up into my neck.  The next morning it was fine again. Just tender and a little stiff.  I attempted to report this on line at instructed on forms given me when I left the site. however the CODE that was to be sent to my phone never came. I then entered the wed site and attempted to report it there. .  Finally I called my primary Dr and he has instructed me to report this to the person giving the second injection.  I doubt they will know what to do seeing as they are volunteers with little experienc.e

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, lot number: EL9262 and expiry date: 31May2021) via Intramuscularly to left arm on 22Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient medical history included bladder infection, blood pressure, she has some old age stuff like blood pressure, and she had Thyroid removed and takes a thyroid pill every day and she tends toward GERD. Concomitant medications included she does take other medications, but they are not relevant. Patient previously took Shingles shot for Shingles (Had the first of the Shingles shot but it was before that. She is due for the second one but she is putting it off for the COVID second dose). Patient reported that she got the COVID vaccine and was really excited because seemingly, she had no side effects. The shot did not hurt. Ten days after she go the shot, she got really hot at night and really strong muscle and joint aches on 31Jan2021. She was up almost all night. It just kept waking her up. So, she took something, an Ibuprofen thing to reduce fever and pain. The next night she took one proactively and did not have pain. The third night, she had it again but it was a headache all night and she was hot on 02Feb2021. It only seemed to happen at night. She felt like it was from the vaccine. She was not worried she had COVID. She had no breathing problems and did not feel like she was going to pass out. They said she should wait 48 hours and take a test to see if she had COVID. She did and it was negative. She does not feel any negativity toward the vaccine. She went in for a bladder infection and it was from a doctor&#39;s appointment that she got information and they told her she could go ahead and get it. Since she got the vaccine, she got white bump in the vicinity of the vaccine like a while mole, and another in the vicinity of the area as well. It does not itch or hurt. She noticed it about a week after the shot. She does not know the date. She was still on medication for a bladder infection but it would not have done anything. When she had reaction to the vaccine, it was already 10 days after she got the shot. She had asked them at Kaiser, and they think it was unrelated to any other medication. Outcome of event fever was recovered on 01Feb2021, for white bump near injection site was not recovered and recovering for all other events.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

The muscle on her arm were tender and swollen as well. The lymphadenopathy, and arm pain and swelling lasted for over a month.   Pfizer :  Lot: 12831/8/21 Lot 9261 1/25/21

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question.

She had an appointment with her surgeon today, and showed it to him, since she thought it was unusual, and he said she may not want to take the second dose, it was not a terrible rash all over her body, mainly concentrated to the area of her back, and it is like a little bit on the back of her neck, not even anything she would notice, but it is there. The patient stated she can&#39;t get through to the Health Department, and she has a card to say to have the second dose on 23Jan2020, but she can&#39;t get through.

                                                Saturday evening 1/23/21 after vaccine, just all of a sudden from one moment to the next, left hand was very tingly and tight feeling and could not move very easily.  A few minutes later her lip from the center left was also tingling, and then spread to entire left side of her body from head to feet, like her left side feel asleep that tingly feeling and numbness.  Began to be worried, called 9-1-1 and the EMT reassured her that she was not having a stroke, and told her that they had heard of it before.  Still today, Monday 1/25/21, particularly in her left hand which she is not able to use very much.  Did take Ibuprofen but nothing else.

Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number was either: EL1283, CL1283, or LL1283) on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took pneumonia shot on an unknown date and flu shot in Oct2020 for immunization. Patient got the first dose of the vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 in the morning. On 11Jan2021 her arm felt tender where the needle went in.On 12Jan2021 late afternoon, she started getting hissing in her ear that was still there and had not gone away at all and she also had a constant humming in her right ear. By 13Jan2021, she still had the humming.  She saw an ENT on 13Jan2021 and doctor didn&#39;t know if it was correlated to the vaccine or not; doctor took some wax out of her ear and she seemed to get relief from the hissing for about 15 minutes but about 15-20 minutes later the hissing/ humming continued. On 14Jan2021, woke up with complete deafness in right ear. Immediately called ENT doctor and did a hearing test. Patient could not hear and they confirmed she had sudden hearing loss in her right ear on 14Jan2021, she had nothing in her right ear (as reported). They put her on 40 mg a day of Prednisone (20mg tablets) and so far, prednisone hadn&#39;t done anything: originally taking prednisone 40mg for four days and was taking two a day;  on 16Jan2021 when she was getting no relief and couldn&#39;t sleep due to the humming in her ear, she called doctor and was advised to take the 40mg together in the morning, she will take 40mg a day. On 19Jan2021 she took 20mg for four days and then decreased by half again. She was also advised by doctor to take 25mg Benadryl (UPC: 30048284 Lot: SPS023 Exp: Jun2022) at night. They are scheduling her for an MRI in Jan2021.Patient was also scheduled for the second dose on 01Feb2021 and will be on the prednisone until 26Jan2021; she would like to know whether the prednisone will diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine. She also asked  if there was a certain amount of time she should wait to restart in case the doctor decided she should not get the second dose; she also wanted to know if she should wait on the second vaccine and maybe start over in two months.She was concerned and wanted to know if she should proceed with the second shot. The patient underwent blood work on an unspecified date to see if she can receive contrast for an MRI. She never had problem with MRI contrast before. Final outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

When asked about treatment, she said she didn&#39;t take anything for this because she doesn&#39;t like to take medicine, and if it is from the vaccine it should go away in a day or so but her diarrhea stayed about the same and has not gotten any better or worse. She also noticed the paperwork that said don&#39;t take Ibuprofen, Aspirin, or blood thinners, and mentioned she takes baby aspirin every day, she wanted to know if that was okay. The outcome of the event diarrhea was not recovered; and the remaining events was unknown.

The next day on Saturday I had more red spots but not quite the same as around my ankles.  More up my legs to my knees.  This morning (Sunday Feb 7th) I now have more spots on my arms.  These spots are not like the dark reds ones around my ankles.  I also have a spot on my face.  I went to the Urgent Care in my area and the opinion of the doctor on call these spots may be related to my vaccine even though it has been 2 and 1/2 weeks since I had the covid  vaccine.  Up until this eposide I have not had any reaction to the vaccine.  They suggested  I contact you with this information.  I was given a Medrol Dose Pak for the rash.  The doctor was not sure the vaccine was the cause of my rash. I would appreciate if someone would contact me and let me know if I should not take my next vaccine which is scheduled for Feb.10 at 9:45 AM.

                                                I developed a rash under my left arm on Feb.1,2021. By Feb. 3, it had spread to under my right arm, my trunk, back and inner thigh area. The rash exhibited a classic pine tree pattern with an initial herald patch under the left arm. The rash is consistent with a diagnosis of Pityriasis Rosea. Over the last 5 days, the rash has begun to fade on the trunk and back and the herald patch has disappeared during the laast 24 hours. A low level if itching has been treated with 25 mg. of Benadryl taken at bedtime.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN5318, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 28Jan2021 17:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Medical history included ongoing macular degeneration and thyroid disorder. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine for thyroid and ascorbic acid, tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc (AREDS). The patient got the vaccine on Thursday 28Jan2021. Thursday and Friday she was fine. However, Saturday morning (30Jan2021) when she woke up she had two red welts, almost like hives on her body and a little bit of itching. Then, the wee hours of yesterday morning (Sunday morning) both arms near her wrist area only were itching like crazy. She was calling to see if it would be okay to take Benadryl for the itching. No one she has called yet has been able to answer her question. She tried contacting the hospital where she got the vaccine. The patient further reported that she noticed the two red welts like hives on her body on Saturday in the morning (30Jan2021) when she woke up, exact time not specified. This has gone away. It went away sometime yesterday (31Jan2021). These were also itchy. She noticed the inside of her arm by the wrist area in the early morning hours yesterday were extremely itchy. She thought for sure she would wake up with red welts but there wasn&#39;t any. Her arms are fine. Now, her back was itchy. Her back now was the only thing now really itching. She placed Cortisone cream on her back and it helped. Her back was still a little itchy, but not as bad. The patient scheduled for her second dose on 18Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of itching/both arms near her wrist area only were itching like crazy/her back was itchy. On 31Jan2021, the patient recovered from &#34;two red welts, almost like hives on her body&#34; and was recovering from itching.

                                                Pain; Burning sensation; Hives; Injection site soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: el1284 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 19Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lymphoma from May2020, had chemotherapy for lymphoma from Jun2020 to 08Oct2020, shingles, knee replacement from 2008 and allergic to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she thinks she was having side effects from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine she got 19Jan2021, tomorrow 02Feb2020 was two weeks from when she got it. Patient didn&#39;t have any side effects to start with, just soreness to the injection site on Jan2021. She says last Wednesday, 27Jan2021, she noticed she had hives, not a rash, on her chest on the left side that are kind of on her breast, the top of her breast, which now spread under her arm up to her shoulder area and back. There was pain along with it, a burning sensation starting last night on 31Jan2021 in the inside area. Since she got her injection on her left side, she doesn&#39;t know if this could be a reaction to the injection or not. She had shingles several years ago, this was acting like that, and it looked like one of the side effects listed is lymphadenopathy, which she looked up information about that, but she doesn&#39;t know what it was, she doesn&#39;t know what else to blame it on. Patient hasn&#39;t seen her doctor yet for hives, and has not treated the hives. She got the OK from the nurse who said she didn&#39;t see a reason for her not to get the vaccine since she was coming off chemo several months prior. Patient was considered to be in remission right now, and she has an appointment next week with her oncologist for follow up. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Hives; itching throughout her body; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL8982), intramuscular on the left arm at the age of 77 years, on 27Jan2021 11:30 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization and cefuroxime axetil (CEFUROXIME AXETIL), oral from 25Jan2021 to Jan2021 at 250 mg, 2x/day (250mg tablet, one tablet twice a day by mouth ) for urinary tract infection. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed many years ago, ongoing rash because she was still having a problem in her pubic area with a rash that is going on, states this is from the urinary tract infection and urinary tract infection from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. When she got the vaccine she was on an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection (UTI), she is asking if there would be any correlation or any interaction between the antibiotic and the vaccine. The antibiotic was something she has taken quite often and has taken it before called cefuroxime axetil. Concomitant medication included insulin (INSULIN) for diabetes. The patient developed itching throughout her body, like hives that started late Friday (29Jan2021) and she will get areas on her hands and arms. This morning it was on her legs where it was red and warm. She reported it goes away and comes back. This morning the hives were fairly heavy and now that she has gotten up and cooled her body down, the hives were subsiding. The outcome of the events was recovering.

The patient medical history was unknown. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were unknown. Caller is calling to see if anyone experienced a reaction like a week after having the first COVID shot. She says she didn&#39;t give it a thought because it had been a week, but her friend today suggested maybe she was having a delayed reaction. She received the shot on 25Jan2021, says she only had the sore arm on 26Jan and it was only at the site of the injection like a regular shot, and then last Monday evening 1Feb2021, she started getting headache and the next morning she felt miserable. On 02Feb2021, she had an upset stomach and was vomiting. She was very tired and that went on for a couple days. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. She had no appetite. Gradually she got a little better and she texted the doctor&#39;s office they suggested she go. they could make her an appointment 25 minutes away to get a COVID test. She was not feeling like driving or riding in the car to get it. Or they suggested that she quarantine for 10 days which is what she has been doing. She is feeling just about back to herself, but she was curious if that could have been from the shot or maybe she just had some other bug. She thinks she was 143 last time a few months ago. The upset stomach and vomiting last also on the 03Feb which made the headache better. She says headache is gone but her head still feels little not quite itself, but the headache is gone. She says the upset stomach and vomiting have recovered completely. The tiredness is ongoing but is much better. She has not had anything else happen and she has had not been around anybody with who was sick unless they were asymptomatic and that would have been only a very few people. She wants to know if it is possible that the vaccine caused a side effect to show up 8 days later. She does not see NDC on her vaccine card. She provides lot number expiration from her vaccine card. Outcome of the events headache, tiredness, she had no appetite were recovering. Vomiting and upset stomach were recovered.

Patient stated, I just wanted to report that I received a Pfizer Covid vaccine on February 6th and experienced some muscle soreness. But on the 12Feb2021, I started feeling like kind of small lumps in that muscle or little below and some redness and by Saturday, redness was about three and a half inches in length and two inches wide and lumps are still there, you could see the lumps. Also, I could feel that knot, it is probably like an inch and a half big knot. I am just thinking if it was reaction. It itched a lot but I didn&#39;t really have any pain or discomfort with it, it just was red and little warmer to touch. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of redness and vaccination site lump was reported as recovering, while the outcome of itching and muscle soreness was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed.

                                                When I awoke this morning and was getting dressed, I noticed a soreness in the back of my left leg (on the right side of the left leg).  I felt a lump,  It was about 2-3 inches above the knee.  It was what I would describe as a medium-sized lump.  I called my doctor to leave a message about my symptoms.  My doctor called  a few minutes after 11 am and asked me to immediately come in so he could see the lump.  He thought I might have a blood clot.  This lump was not present late last night because when I put lotion on my legs after my shower, I felt no lump or soreness.  I worked out this morning and by 11:00, it seemed to me the lump was not as big as it was when I was getting dressed earlier this morning.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration upper arm probably only about 4inches down from shoulder blade on the left on 12Jan2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID on 01Oct2020. Concomitant medication included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) as blood thinner. The patient previously took a flu and shingles shot and experienced her redness and swelling on her arm. The patient did not have vaccinations four weeks prior, and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. She got it because she was told by her doctor that her antibodies will not last forever and it was still necessary to get it even though she already had COVID antibodies. She contracted COVID on 01Oct2020, that was the date when she had a positive test then she was last tested in December and she still had the antibodies then. She received her first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday 12Jan2021 and 24 hours later on 13Jan2021, she experienced chills and feeling very hot, which she took Tylenol extra strength for and it disappeared the next day. Her arm also swelled, not the whole arm, she would say about 3 inches around the site, 4 inches at the most and it was still swollen, it was red and itchy. Then she woke up in a horrible sweat but by the following morning it was gone. She wouldn&#39;t say it was a horrible reaction but she wanted to be certain she can go ahead and get the second shot which she had an appointment for. She said everything has resolved completely except for the swelling, her arm was still swollen, itchy, and red. Since the swelling, redness and itchiness began she would say it was slightly better than it was. The patient received the vaccine at an independent assisted living facility, not a military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events chills, feeling very hot and woke up in a horrible sweat was recovered on 14Jan2021, while the remaining events was recovering.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the covid vaccine, I developed a red flush on my face which was bright, hot and uncomfortable. The flush appeared nowhere else on my  body so I concluded that the vaccine must have interacted with the tretinoin cream I use nightly. That is the only area of my skin on which i apply the cream. When I got home, I applied soothing skin cream but no relief. I then tried aloe, which grows in the area, and the flush/burning abated somewhat. The next day, my face was still flushed but less red. the skin surface was scaly. I am continuing to treat at home. No MDs involved.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number unknown), intramuscular into the left arm on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant drugs were none. The patient developed swelling and a pretty significant bruise where the injection was given in her left arm. The caller noticed the bruise and swelling on 25Jan2021 but states it could be older. The events were reported as medically significant. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of vaccination site swelling and bruise cannot be excluded, considering the temporal association and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.

Now the whole joint is red and a few of the other nodes have turned red.    Except for binding the first finger with the hope it would help (it didn&#39;t), I&#39;m not treating them, since of course one can&#39;t do anything about osteoarthritis except ease the pain.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6201), intramuscular, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021, 14:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy in feet, cholesterol (abnormal), 2 vertebra in her back that are starting to fuse, shrinking as she&#39;s getting older, allergic to NSAIDS, she clarifies Advil, Tylenol and the medications reverses on her and gives her a headache, and she gets itchy; was in the hospital for surgery, for lady stuff and needs glasses. She doesn&#39;t have a heart problem she doesn&#39;t have any other medical issues. She&#39;s not diabetic the neuropathy was idiopathic.  Concomitant medications included atorvastatin for cholesterol (abnormal), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA). The patient previously took morphine and was allergic, and hallucinating as she was told by the nurse, she said there were monkeys on the ceiling and her husband was trying to kill her and gets itchy with morphine. This is the same reaction she had when found out she had the reaction to NSAIDs, for example, she could take Advil or Tylenol for one night but it she took it two nights, that was when she woke up itching all over. She reports no rash, just itch. It just lasted that one night and it was gone. She could take some Advil and get that itchy feeling. On 01Mar2021, the patient experienced left arm aching from the site of the injection back down under the back of her arm to the back part of her elbow, then it comes to the far outer part of her forearm down to the wrist and ring finger and pinky finger; numbness down left arm/it was also partially numb, she has feeling because it&#39;s aching and she was describing it as an ache, not sharp just an ache. She can feel it, but its not all there. She knows all this stuff was new to all of us. She&#39;s following up and doesn&#39;t keep her up at night it&#39;s just not normal; and on 24Feb2021, her torso, the night after injection, from her armpits to her hips was itchy. She woke up and she went to the bathroom scratching her back and stomach. Her Covid 19 vaccine card was handwritten she sees 23Feb2021 and that&#39;s the date she got the shot. She&#39;s been isolating since Feb2020. She was only going out for necessity. She took a risk and had family at her home for Christmas. She hasn&#39;t been to church in almost a year, so she was taking this very seriously. Before they even started telling you to wear a mask she was listening to the news in December and January. She states, alright she&#39;s isolating, it&#39;s the safest thing she can do she&#39;s not ready to leave this world yet even knowing she&#39;s past her golden years. Her doctor put her on Atorvastatin it because of her age, she had blood drawn but she wasn&#39;t given any counts on an unspecified date. Her first thought was she had a chest problem but it&#39;s not a heart attack, the ache doesn&#39;t go any farther than what she told. It&#39;s not stopping her from being productive, from doing things. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room, physician office and was not hospitalized. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no events following prior vaccinations. Outcome of event itchy torso from armpits to hips/itchy back and stomach was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

                                                I had the second Covid (Pfizer) vaccine on February 22. The next day I had chills, fever, aches, nausea and was very weak. After about 30 hours I felt okay again.  However, a week and a half later, I noticed red bumps on the back of my neck. The next day, my neck and scalp had red, itchy blotches. Through the next five days, these spread down my body to my ankles until I was covered with the red, very itchy blotches. I did go to Urgent Care on the third day and I was given a 5-day prescription of Prednisone. It did not do much until the third day and then it relieved the itching somewhat for about 6 hours, but then it would start again. After the five days of Prednisone, I took Benedryl for three days until the itch and redness disappeared.  I checked the facility web site on types of rashes and my rash fits the description (and the photo) of a drug-related rash, but I have not changed or added any drugs for several years other than the Covid vaccine (I did some research online and found two other people who have had the same problems I have had after the second Covid vaccine. Both of them had the typical reaction of chills, fever, aches and dizziness for about a day after the second shot and then 1-2 weeks later, broke out in a rash. Both reported having the rash start at the neck or head and then spreading down the body throughout one to two weeks before disappearing. There were photos on the facility site of drug-related rashes and they were exactly like what I had.  Since the rash was almost certainly covid vaccine related, I am making this report, which my doctor recommended. I had no other changes in diet, medications, environment, etc. ? only the Pfizer vaccine was new to my body.

This nurse (patient) reported that a 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6204) at the age of 78-years, via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 at single dose; first single dose of BNT162B2 (lot: EM9810) on 11Feb2021; both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoarthritis (having aches and pains) had for 20 years; large sliding hiatal hernia was diagnosed from an EGD six months before, didn&#39;t want surgery to fix it; heartburn (last five years); fatty liver, was not from drinking alcohol; generalized anxiety; was tuberculosis positive only because she was exposed years ago. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole started four to five years before at 40 mg twice a day for heartburn; escitalopram (tablet) been on for 15 years or longer at 10 mg 1 DF every day for generalized anxiety; clonazepam 0.5 mg nightly at bedtime for anxiety (been taking for last ten years or more, stops her from worrying about her kids and stuff like that). The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

Took a Claritine which gave no relief.  Calked Dr. office and they advised me to go to urgent care. Which I did.  Had the severe itching for about 3 hrs.  No difficulty breathing or swallowing.  Given IV fluids, normal saline and IV diphenhydramine ( up to 50 mg),  methylprednisone 125mg and famotidine 20mg.  Got relief quite rapidly.

                                                That evening I noticed a round bruised-looking circle above the area on the left shoulder where the shot was given.  The next day I noticed these same circles on the inside of my left arm, 3 of which felt like a pinpoint knot where they were (attaching pictures).  I can still feel the knot.  After a day or two I found 2 more on my right leg (one on the thigh and one down on the leg.)  I don&#39;t recall any little knots on these two.  I do not feel all of these areas spots are bothersome or worrisome but I was told by my daughter to notify the County about them.  I do take Plavix every day and have since 2003 which I feel may have caused this reaction.

Call the clinic and the lady who answered the phone found a doctor and asked what I should to.   The doctor suggested taking Bendryl.  I also washed the areas with soap and water which seemed to help.  In the morning I took a bath with baking soda; this also eased the rash.  I am continuing to take Benadryl, 1 tablet every 4 hours.

                                                rash on both arms at the site of the nicotine patch; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3249) first dose on 19Jan2021 10:00 o left arm at single dose for want to be safe. Co-suspect product included nicotine transdermal system patch (lot number: 50430, expiration date: Mar2023) at 21mg; apply to the skin daily from Dec2020 (since 12Dec2020 or 15Dec2020)and ongoing for help stop smoking. Medical history included surgery on her neck in Dec2020 and states everything was fine and Diabetes. This surgery predates treatment with the vaccine. Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing insulin human, insulin human injection, isophane (HUMULIN 70/30) for Diabetes taking for over 10 years. The patient previously received Flu shot on 10Dec2021 (age 79-year-old female) for immunization. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. She just got the vaccine today (19Jan2021). Everything went fine. The shot didn&#39;t hurt. The process went really smooth. She just wants to get rid of this virus. She waited the time period there and then went home. When she was changing clothes after she got home, she noticed a rash. She had been wearing a nicotine patch. On both arms, in both places where she had worn the patch on her arms there is a rash. Clarified she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine 19Jan2021 at 10:00AM in the left arm. She noticed a couple of hours later a rash at the location of where she had previously worn the nicotine patch on both arms. She has been on the patch for a month and has not had any rash before. Adds she is supposed to use alternate arms and change daily. The rash is where she used it the last time. She did wash those places this morning before she had the shot so she thinks there shouldn&#39;t be any residue. She just changed it to a new location and there is no rash at the new location of the patch yet. Adds there is no pain or itching, just a rash. She is scheduled 09Feb2021 for the second dose. Mentions she was not sure if she should report but she didn&#39;t want another elderly person to get the rash and be scared. She imagines that Pfizer already tested the vaccine with tobacco. Event did not require a visit to physician or ER. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included severe leg cramps. Concomitant medication included gabapentin. The patient previously took tetanus shot (TETANUS VACCINE) and flu shot (FLU VACCINE) on an unspecified date (reported as November) for immunisation. The patient verbalized, &#34;I just wanted to make sure that this is normal. I got my vaccine yesterday. I waited for 30 minutes because I did have an allergy (further clarification was unknown, hence captured as event), to make sure everything was okay. Nothing happened but after I got home within 2 hours my shoulder down to my elbow it is very sore and swollen. It is very sore and swollen for some days but it is just in the area where they gave the shot. So, I just want to make sure that it&#39;s normal.&#34; When asked about the treatment, the patient stated, &#34;No I did not I thought about taking some Aleve or whatever but my husband and I decided to wait till this morning and call to see that if it is normal like I said like a tetanus shot or flu shot. I am very sore in that area about 5 days but this was little different that it swelled from my shoulder to my elbow. I do not feel sick, I am not dizzy, and I am not short of breath. I read everything that they ask that they said you have a concern to call.&#34; Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I had no issues with the first dose. When they gave the 2nd dose, I felt strange feeling in my arm. I felt fine after that until the night. About 8PM I got a bad headache, I was so cold all over and I could not get warm, My blood pressure was 153/93. Body aches all over. My skin be sensitive it felt like it hurt to touch my skin. I couldn&#39;t sleep last night and was up and down all night. Today I still got a headache. I have been taking Tylenol which didn&#39;t help and tried Excedrin. I feel very tired today but I was awake a lot last night.  I still have the chills as well.

I woke up two other times throughout the night. I was weak, and yesterday the pain was somewhat lessened, but I had an intermittent mild head ache throughout the day, and I went to bed early last night. This morning the ache was still a little achy and tired, but that had cleared up by noon.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number A3249 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 21Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included other medications. The patient had the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 21Jan2021 and the following day (22Jan2021), she experienced pain in the injection site and arm. The patient informed that it felt like someone stuck a knife in her muscle. The patient informed that the pain was improving and not sure if she wanted to get the second dose. The patient informed that she had a dental procedure done and was taking pain medication to help with that but it didn&#39;t help with her pain in her arm from the shot. The patient has been having pain at injection site all the way to her elbow. The patient informed that the first day they it was like she had a shot. The patient informed that it felt like a knife was being stuck in her muscle the second day (22Jan2021). The patient informed that today it felt like pressure. The patient informed that at night time that she sleeps perfect and when she gets up in the morning that it was bad pain. The patient informed that she was leery about getting her second shot. The patient informed that she had two teeth pulled on Friday (unspecified date) after she got the vaccine. The patient informed that they redid her partial for those teeth. The patient informed that they had prescribed 800 mg of ibuprofen for her teeth. The patient stated that she thought it would help the pain in her arm but it did not. The patient was told to keep taking it but she stopped. The patient informed that she has to take antibiotics for her teeth until they were all gone. Therapeutic measures was received by the patient due to the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Vaccination site had an odd shaped reddishness. At one point I had on 4 layers of clothing and still shivered so put on my winter coat and tucked a heating pad inside. Temperature was a little above 100 accompanied by aching which all lasted 24 hours.

A 79-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at 08:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has a lot of medical conditions (unspecified). Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 (lot number: EL3286) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fever. The patient reported that she had her shot this morning (29Jan2021) at about 08:30 and towards evening, the shot started to hurt and so she wanted to make sure that it didn&#39;t go against anything, and put a little ice on it or maybe it was worthless on ice on certain situations after the fact that she thought this was too late. She wanted to make sure she could do that. The patient&#39;s blood pressure also went up on 29Jan2021. She was taking several different medicines for blood pressure. She took them already tonight. She was hoping that she will be feeling a little bit better. Sometimes, she gets a little fever on Jan2021, also like maybe 99 (unspecified). She just wanted to know if any of the medications were good or not for the shot. The patient was asking whether the drugs interacted. The patient also reported that when she took her first shot, she had a little fever and asked what she could take for it. An agent stated that she could take paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient mentioned that she took her pills, otherwise, her head felt like it was going to explode on Jan2021. She took her high blood pressure medicines. She has three medications namely clonidine, losartan and propranolol. She has a lot of medical conditions that was why she was calling because she takes other medications. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Does that have anything to do with that shot?&#34; The reporter confirmed that the next shot is due on 22Feb2021. The patient added that, &#34;Actually last week they were really light, and they just keep getting worst. I was actually going to call my doctor tomorrow because I was concerned about getting this injection anyways because of my history on having reactions to medicine. I can&#39;t take any like Oxycodone or like any of those (also reported as &#34;I can&#39;t take any of those drugs, I am allergic to all that stuff. Yeah I can&#39;t take any of that pain medicine (Unspecified Medications). No, I don&#39;t have anything like that.&#34;). I can&#39;t take any of those drugs (Unspecified Medications). And she said she thought it would be alright but I am recovering from very serious back surgery and so I have had a hard time with that. So, I thought I should call and see if I should get my second injection or if I should just let it go.&#34; It was also reported that:  &#34;Yes, it&#39;s like my chest is burned.&#34; Consumer stated for the treatment, &#34;The only thing I put on was Benadryl cream. To keep it from &#39;itching&#39;.&#34; The patient asked &#34;Should I get the second injection?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

I have not been to Urgent care .  I informed people giving me vaccine I was on blood thinners.  Nobody seem to show concern about that.  I have already received 2nd shot, which I got very sick after, but symptoms seem to happen to others.  My concern is the lump on my leg if it is a clot and concern if I will get more now that I took the 2nd vaccine.

                                                Hard red knot appeared immediately at the injection site. Later in the day, the knot became hot. After a couple of days, a red rash about 6 inches in diameter appeared around the injection site. The rash is splotchy and bumpy. It is also hot. The rash continued to get larger. On the 6th day, I took a Benadryl tablet before going to bed. This morning (one week after the injection) the rash is not as hot and the knot seems slightly smaller. There is still swelling.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 30Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergic to penicillin and bee stings. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had flu vaccine and had a flu and shingles vaccine and had shingles for 3 weeks after she took the shingles vaccine. The patient received her first vaccine on 30Jan2021. On 31Jan2021, the patient ended up in ER with hives from the vaccine. She was told that she would be given Prednisone for hives but not to take it until Monday at noon. Stated that they wanted her to wait 48 hours after vaccine before she started it because it would cut it in half. She started Prednisone 40mg on Monday and did get a few more hives on Tuesday and Wednesday. She had the shot in her right arm, and all this happened on the left side of her back. She had a patch of hive of 5x6 to 8x8 on her back and on the back of her arm by her elbow and forearm. She put apple cider vinegar on her arms, and she did not itch anymore. Someone told her that this could be shingles. She stated that she got flu vaccine and got sick with flu and she took the shingles vaccine and got shingles. She could not stand in shower with the shingles but that she can with this, so she knows that it is not the shingles. The patient did not want to take the second shot on 20Feb2021 and wanted to know what Pfizer thinks. She does like to travel and hopes to soon so she wanted to know if not taking the shot could get a stipulation if they required two shots to travel. She has nerve on back shoulder to side and back of arm to forearm to her thumb which is not spasming, but she knows that it is there which came on in the past week (2021). She was on Prednisone 40 mg for 5 days and she still had hives (though they are diminishing). The patient stated that she still has &#34;lizard skin&#34;. She received the shot on her right arm, but the hives spread on the left shoulder down the arm and forearm where she had shingles. Her ER doctor told her not to take the second dose and her primary care physician told her to wait and think about it. She is wondering if she should receive the second dose. The outcome of the event hives was not recovered while the other events was unknown.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered on the left arm on 21Apr2021 13:12 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia (diagnosed more than 20 years ago), bladder cancer (diagnosed 13 years ago the first time, 8 reoccurrences and has been cancer free for 2 years, cancer free for 2 years), multi drug allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, diabetes, and obesity. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, levothyroxine, and oxazepam. No vaccines received within 2 weeks. In 12 minutes after the injection on 21Apr2021, while she was still sitting in the parking lot, patient developed tachycardia on and extreme flushing to face and neck on 13:20.  They were as red as being in the sun.  She was aware of tachycardia first.  Then she looked in the mirror and was glowing red. Patient was observing in parking lot and took her pulse and it was 145. Persistent head to toe macular erythematous rash occurred next.  They took her to the ER about 20 minutes after the injection. In the ER, she was given 25mg of Benadryl IV and 125 mg of Solumedrol IV.  When both of those wore off the next day, the generalized rash came back on Thursday (22Apr2021).  The rash was persistent but not as flushed looking as before. When they got her into ER, the first blood pressure reading was 198/117, which was within 20 minutes of injection. Hypertension was experienced on 13:30. Her blood pressure usually was fairly low and was back to normal now. She had one reading of 124/76 to 170/something. Her normal range is anywhere between 150-170/70-80&#39;s. She is on Lisinopril. The other morning when it was 124/76, was just a fluke. That was an unusually good reading. They did a regular panel of lab work when she went to the ER. They did not tell her that anything was abnormal.  She asked them to run an A1C, but they told her they could not. They did a chest film, EKG, placed IV to give medications, but no fluids given. Her doctor said not to get second dose of the vaccine.  She had it at the hospital and they had reports of other people with a rash. The patient considered the events tachycardia, extreme flushing, macular erythematous rash and hypertension were medically significant while for headache was non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were possibly causally related to the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to plausible temporal relationship.  This case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, EH9896), via an unspecified route of administration to very top of right arm on 22Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. It was the first dose. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Medical history included glaucoma she had drops to take for, mostly she just has problem with her joints and her back with her age. She did not have any diseases or anything; she was not diabetic, nothing like that. There were no concomitant medications. She was administered her first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine on 22Dec2020. She reported that the pain or little discomfort she had in the arm she received the injection in disappeared by 25Dec2020. But on 24Dec2020 she started to get very sick, which continued to worsen until now when she felt like she was improving. She did not know if these events could have something to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Pain or little discomfort in the arm she received the injection: Right arm. Everyone warned her that the site would hurt, so she was really glad when it totally went away on 25Dec2020 and thought that it was over; any issues from the injection. Very sick: this event started to get bad on 24Dec2020, she was very tired and not very hungry, she had stomach and abdominal pains and loose stool; 25Dec2020 those symptoms were  worse. It was Christmas so she cooked and thought at first maybe she got carried away baking pies; because that evening she started to have pain and did not each much. 26Dec2020 it was worse; she said she was going to work on 27Dec2020; it was terrible because she was stuck for 12 hours trying to work while very sick. She called off of work 28Dec2020 and 29Dec2020. Since then she has stayed home and still has pain but she took her ranitidine delayed release 100mg twice daily as needed for stomach pain as given to her by her doctor, and is now down to just once daily. She did not know what she would have done without the ranitidine. She did not have any more abdominal pain, but her stomach was still very sensitive. She was tired but thought she was going to be ok. She was scared to get the second scheduled dose of COVID-19 Vaccine because she thought the side effects will be more severe with the booster shot. She just needed to rest and stay home which she has been doing. She has not had any fever. She has not notified her family doctor of these events. There was nothing she did on Christmas that she could think of other than she drank a glass of champagne because she did not know her stomach was going to be so bad. The outcome of the events Pain or little discomfort in the arm she received the injection was recovered on 25Dec2020, the outcome of event sickness was recovering, the outcome of the event Abdominal pain was recovered on an unknown date in Dec2020, the outcome of event stomach pain was not recovered, the outcome of the other events was unknown.

Never have had an allergy or allergic reaction all my life to anything.  The only thing different done since new year is the Covid-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) was the vaccine.  It was my first dose and questioning whether to do 2nd vaccination.  If I am allergic to the synthetic vaccine...I am uncertain about taking the 2nd dose which could catastrophically cause more problems as in constriction of breathing, rashes , death etc.  I am due for 2nd dose on 01/28/21.  I would appreciate input as to whether i should receive 2nd dose; and i wanted to report my adverse affect which i am still having.  Thank you.

Know this is normal, but on 3rd day it got considerably worse and this is now a week later, and arm is much better, but for 2-3 days it was painful.   Scheduled to back for 2nd injection on Feb. 13.  Is this going to be a problem?  Was told by oncologist 2 1/2 years ago not to use right arm for anything.   Do not want to miss 2nd injection.  OK to have injection again in the left arm?

The itchy is driving me nuts--benedryl helps a little.  SHOULD I GET MY SECOND DOSE WHICH IS DUE FEBRUARY 10?

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot: EL8982) intramuscular in right arm on 22Jan2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Patient previously took shingles vaccine as immunization and she had had a small reaction, she had a patch of shingles break out around her arm at the site of injection site. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for Gastroparesis, ongoing erythromycin, ongoing aluminum hydroxide/magnesium carbonate (GAVISCON) for acid reflux (esophageal), ongoing calcium for Osteoporosis, ongoing losartan for Blood pressure, ongoing acetaminophen for arthritis, ongoing spironolactone as diuretic, ongoing tramadol for Osteoarthritis, vitamin C [ascorbic acid] as general supplementation, ongoing alprazolam for Anxiety, ongoing doxazosin for high blood pressure, ongoing fenofibrate for High cholesterol, ongoing vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX) as general supplementation, ongoing bisoprolol for high blood pressure, ongoing magnesium good for heart recommended by cardiologist, ongoing biotin for hair and nails, ongoing zinc as immunity booster, ongoing montelukast sodium for allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, ongoing levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) for allergies, ongoing cyclobenzaprine for leg cramps at night as muscle relaxer, ongoing macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) as laxative and ongoing &#34;CVS brand multivitamin at one tablet once a day oral as general supplementation&#34; (as reported).The patient experienced face felt hot and flushed and face red on 24Jan2021; gray spot on forehead on 25Jan2021; was tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot, face was burning and burned bright red face feeling sunburned in Jan2021.Events were described as follows: patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and she had a few mild symptoms. She did not feel really good for a day or two but it was nothing that alarmed her, she was tired and wiped out. She always took a shower since she had arthritis and it get gets her joints going. On 24Jan2021 after she got out of the shower, her face felt hot and it was red. She didn&#39;t think too much about it and it went away pretty soon. She did not connect it with the vaccine. On 25Jan2021 she took a little longer shower and the same thing happened, but it was 10 or 12 times worse in regards to her face feeling hot and was red. She was drying off and getting dressed and reported her face felt funny and it was really hot. When she looked at it was bright red like she had the worst sunburn, it felt like a sunburn. Her face was red and eyes were red bloodshot and it lasted about half an hour; her face got real flushed like a real bright sunburn and her face was burning and burned bright red. She started putting on cold wet wash cloths to help cool her face down and when it the wash cloths got warm, she would wet it again to cool her face down some more. She was alarmed but about 30 minutes later it started lightening up a bit and pretty soon it was back to normal. Her face felt different in the afternoon, it was a little red. She worked out in yard and last summer she got an insect bite on her forehead that turned gray, it was the size of silver dollar. After the hot flush thing this morning, that gray spot came back. Her doctor said it might take a while for it to go away. Her face felt warm like it has been sunburned. Her throat was dry since she has been waiting on the phone for an hour. Her face feeling sunburned/hot was about 95% gone, barely there. Her face getting red started on 24Jan2021 morning and it was almost gone. Treatment included ponds face cream and it was very soothing. Patient just wanted to know what to do about this flushing of her face and if it was dangerous what she can  do. She would like to know if she should be worried about this, it only happened when she took a shower. She was asking if there was anything she can do before she can get the second injection, so it does not happen again or what to do if it does happen again. Final outcome of tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot and face was burning and burned bright red/her face feeling sunburned/ face got really like the worst sunburn was unknown; outcome of the other events was not recovered.

My arm starting hurting &amp; a few days later, I broke out with tiny dark red spots inside a red swollen circle.  Arm remained with a burning aching pain. My dermatologist said it was definately shingles &amp; prescribed a 10 day treatment of antiviral medication.  She didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine but  should report this.   The shingles are just below the shot area.

                                                Asthma attack began about 20 minutes after injection, with throat tightening, slight mouth swelling sensation and immediate wheezing which grew progressively worse.  I had my inhalers (Levalbuterol and Flovent) with me, used Levalbuterol at the direction of medical people who surrounded me after I reported wheezing.  They gave me a Benadryl, then brought a wheel chair and sent me directly to the ER.  I was there about 3 hours during which I had a heart monitor,  a &#34;breathing treatment&#34; by a respiratory therapist, and DUONEB, famotidine (PEPCID), and (DELTASONE). I was given a 3 day Rx for 20 mg. of prednisone, and released.  My lungs felt &#34;twitchy&#34; the next day and my voice was muted, but was well otherwise.   The only &#34;normal&#34; side effect I had was some soreness at the injection site for a couple of days, with some light sensitivity there for a few weeks.

AN 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at 13:00 (at the age of 80-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included highly sensitive and highly allergic to everything from food to medicine; had been through near death with allergies; allergic to penicillin, iodine and shellfish; high blood pressure, eye disorder (unspecified), allergies with her sinuses. Concomitant medications were not reported, but the patient took unspecified high blood pressure and eye medication. The patient previously took dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride (DARVON), ether and castor oil and experienced allergies; sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) for severe acute sinusitis on Jan2021 (about a month ago). On 11Feb2021 at 13:20, the patient start feeling dizzy and faint like, and felt a little tired. She came home and went to bed and on 11Feb2021, had itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine) and on the right side of the arm near the elbow, the middle part of the stomach and the neck (itching came and went) and later, her sinuses started to drain. On 12Feb2021, the patient&#39;s feet felt stiff and the bone in the right leg felt strange. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient had pain in the shoulder. The patient queried if she can take aspirin for the pain in the shoulder and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) if the itching comes back. The clinical outcome of pain in the shoulder was unknown, of &#34;itching on right side of arm near elbow, middle part of stomach and neck&#34;, &#34;feeling dizzy and faint like&#34;, tired, sinuses started to drain, &#34;feet felt stiff and bone in right leg felt strange&#34; and &#34;itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine)&#34; was resolving.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EN6200) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies, hip surgery, and foot surgery three times. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. Patient reported she has been so sick. She got the shot on Monday 15Feb2021, and that same day she got so sick, it was horrible. Patient had chills, fever, aches and pains, and if someone named it, it was there. She stated that before Monday she was 183 pounds, didn&#39;t know if it has changed as she has not been on a scale, but she was sure it has because hasn&#39;t eaten since Monday, as she has had no appetite. Her appointment was at 07:45, and she went right when she got up, so she did not really have anything to eat on Monday. Patient stated that on Tuesday, she did not eat anything until the evening when she had one piece of pizza. Today, patient has only had a yogurt. Today was the first time she has gotten out of bed and even felt like getting dressed and putting her contacts in, since Monday. The last few days, patient stated that after getting up and going to the bathroom she would walk downstairs and felt weak as a kitten (15Jan2021). Patient stated that she was at least 80% better, because she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door (Feb2021), and she was not a wimp, it was just horrible. Patient mentioned that she was on a lot of medicine, probably 10, but this was the first time she was receiving this vaccine. She stated that she was still having pain where the injection occurred (Feb2021), like when her shirt touches it, she can tell it was there. But patient stated that she had the nicest nurse and the injection itself did not hurt, it was just later, and the injection site got swollen (Feb2021). Outcome of the event she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door, chills, fever, aches and pains, felt weak as a kitten was recovering; no appetite was not recovered; while the other events was unknown.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

The patient developed heart flutter at night on 3/4/21, which she thought was a heart attack.  She called EMS and they checked her out and all her vitals were normal.  She saw her MD on 3/5/21 who said it was not a heart attack and she was fine.  He did not think the symptoms were related to the vaccination and he thought the heart flutter was stress related.   The heart flutter went away on it&#39;s own.   She also developed a red rash all over her body the evening of 3/5/21 that is still present.  She has been treating that with Vaseline intensive care and Aloe.  Her skin is very dry and crepey

An 80-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284) on left arm, intramuscular on 02Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pancreatic cancer stage IV metastasized, blood pressure (abnormal) and chemo. Concomitant medication included pancreatin (CREON) for pancreatic enzymes. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a side effect and it&#39;s so weird, she was a cancer patient she was in (city, state) and she had her first Covid vaccine on 12Jan2021 and she had her second one on 02Feb2021 and not a reaction until yesterday (06Feb2021) her left arm got a red rash, all the way up and down her shoulder to mid way between her elbow and hand and some swelling and she just wanted to make sure. She did look at the sheet and it does say you can get a rash, she has no temperature and she wanted to make sure that&#39;s a part of it all. When clarified if the retired registered nurse wanted to if it was the side effects from Covid vaccine, she stated, she guessed so because she got it on Tuesday and her arm hurt a little bit (Feb2021) but no rash showed up until yesterday which was Saturday. The patient had blood work done last Monday on 01Feb2021 with unknown results. The patient reported that she knows her white count was low (unspecified date) because they could give her chemo, so she actually has blood work on Monday 01Feb2021. Treatment was not received and patient stated, it just showed up yesterday and her nurse told her not to put anything on it. The outcome of the events was unknown.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was taking quite a few unspecified concomitant medications. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. The vaccine was administered in a clinic facility. On 27Jan2021, the patient&#39;s vaccine arm was a little tired and sore - typical of a shot. No problem, however. No treatment was administered for the adverse events. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient was recovering from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 15:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included wrist had arthritis (pain). There were no concomitant medications. Patient height was a little less than 5. She used to be over 5 but she shrunk. Her weight used to be at 226 lbs, it came up to 230. This year (2021) it went up because, its her, she ate too much and she did not obey the rules. Patient received Pfizer vaccine on 06Feb2021 afternoon at 300 pm in her left arm and that night developed itchiness, numbness and tingling in her fingers on the right side.

She applied muscle relaxant (unclear if topical) and took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and massaged her hand with warm water and then for the second time she used the muscle relaxation. She hadn&#39;t taken paracetamol yet she was waiting 4 hours but the pain was still there, it was a little bit less. Not sure if it her arthritis or side effects from vaccine but believes it was from the vaccine. Stated she used to have the same problem with her wrist arthritis (pain). Also reported that she experienced additional side effects on 08Feb2021 which lasted about 5 minutes then went away: blurry eyes; wanting to faint; dizziness, sweating (whole body started to be like sweaty). Asking for information on muscle and joint pain after the vaccine and recommendations on what to do. So far she didn&#39;t know what it was, and if it was a side effect of the arthritis, because once in a while that happens but when it happened it went away right away but this time her wrist pain was there still there. Patient sat down and now she was stretching her leg, she sat down on the chair and its gone she had no more problems. Patient said her right hand, she was very slow writing. She said at least she can write her hand was going back to a routine but she was in a lot of pain. Outcome of event wanting to faint/dizziness, blurry eyes, sweating was recovered on 08Feb2021, and outcome of other events was unknown.

She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient&#39;s lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler. She said she has been using the Serevent Diskus Inhaler for seasonal allergies for years and the inhaler works. She said she occasionally uses the Serevent Diskus for colds during the winter. She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus. NDC Number: 0173-0521-00, Lot Number: VV3E, Expiration Date: Sep2021) and Flovent (Flovent HFA 110mcg Inhaler, NDC Number: 0170719-20, Lot Number: C47A, Expiration Date: Jul2021). That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she&#39;s doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient&#39;s big concern was that she probably shouldn&#39;t get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E73246, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 14:15 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cardiac pacemaker insertion, high blood pressure for years. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS). The patient previously took flu shot (FLU VACCINE II) and never had a reaction to the flu shot, macrodantin and experienced drug hypersensitivity and hives. It was reported that about 15:15, injection site felt like it was on fire and then the whole arm felt like it was on fire. The patient got concerned. Her throat felt like it was going to close. Symptoms got less severe. She was fine yesterday and was fine that day. She called her doctor and was advised to put cold compresses on the arm and take Tylenol. She was ok. She read an article that stated if a person had a reaction to not have the second shot. She did not know if her reaction is severe. The second shot is due around 27Jan2021. She wanted to know what to do.  She felt fine on the day of report and was fine 2-3 hours after the onset of the hot and fiery feeling. It was scary and she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She also added that around 15:15, the injection arm felt like it was on fire. She felt flushed. Her throat felt like it would close up but never did. Everything resolved 2-3 hours after it started. Clinical outcome of the events was recovered on 06Jan2021.

                                                My left arm started to hurt during the night and when I got up on Friday, the 12th it was hard to move it without severe muscular pain.  The pain has persisted into today, Monday, the 15th,  but it is slowly getting better.  The pain is localized to my upper arm, and depending on how I move it, can become worse.   I am treating the symptoms with Tylenol and aspirin-containing creams.

The on the 4th I have a lady who comes out to my house and helps me bath and she put gold bond lotion all over.  I thought it was the lotion so I bathed again and got the lotion off my body. It is has since gotten worse and worse, I have  little red spots on back, shoulders and arm. My shoulder has red bumps on it, looks like a rash and is rough feeling. The itching and spots are still there as of 2/23/2021. I spoke PA at my doctor&#39;s office and she called in  a prescription Pepcid AC 20 MG (one a day) and Wal-zyr (generic Zyrtec )  on the 2/19/2021. I have also been putting some Hydrocortisone cream on it as well.

A 82-years-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot # EL8982) vaccine, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm  on 29Jan2021 13:30 at single dose  for Covid-19 immunisation .  Medical history included anticoagulant therapy , bone disorder, vitamin D deficiency (vitamin supplementation), probiotic therapy, rhinorrhoea, lung congestion, dry eye .  Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81), calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (CALCIUM 500&#43;D3), colecalciferol (D3), ascorbic acid, tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc (AREDS), bifidobacterium infantis (ALIGN) , guaifenesin (MUCINEX), macrogol 400, propylene glycol (SYSTANE), metronidazole (METRONIDAZOLE).  The patient experienced the needle had not been completely secured  on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown ,  felt fluid rushing down her arm/solution ran down her arm/it ran to her elbow, she saw a collection of fluid at her elbow/ two drops of medication leak down her arm  on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown , i had a lump on my arm the size of a large jaw breaker in my arm/hard lump at injection site for about 5 hours  on 29Jan2021 with outcome of recovered , bruising at the site  on 29Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered , headache on 30Jan2021 with outcome of recovered.  The patient took Tylenol for her  headache. The patient stated that states her injection site was already black and blue when she got home and removed the bandage. Adds in her photo her whole shoulder is yellow and it looks jaundiced.  The nurse stated that the incident occurred on Friday 29Jan2021 , so they had multiple different type of syringes and needles that was using to administered and they had a vaccinator who was using a lower lock syringe in which you case you know you have to secure the needle by twisting in to that lower lock and when he went to administer the vaccine to the patient two drops of medication leak down her arm, so of course we are at that point the vaccinator realize the lower lock and that the needle had not been completely secured so we don&#39;t know how much vaccine the patient actually received.  Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.

An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 82-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included the patient was on blood thinner therapy; allergy to a lot of medications, mold and cut grass; operation to remove clots in Nov2020 (two months prior to vaccination); thyroid disorder. Concomitant medications included unspecified thyroid pills and apixaban (ELIQUIS) as a blood thinner. The patient previously took moxifloxacin (AVELOX) and experienced allergy and rash and was in the hospital. On 24Jan2021 (the next day after vaccination), the patient experienced an &#34;allergy so bad&#34;, swelling and hives all over her body. The patient went to the emergency room due to the events and was &#34;hooked up&#34; with intravenous (IV)s for an hour before she could go home. The reactions were assessed as related to the vaccination by the patient. The patient was scheduled for her second dose on 23Mar2021. She was not given the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine fact sheet for recipients and caregivers until after being administered the first dose of the vaccine. If she had been given the fact sheet for recipients and caregivers before being administered the first dose, she would not have gotten the vaccine because the sheet says not to get the shot if you are allergic to other medications or other reasons for allergies or on blood thinners. The patient questioned whether she should get the second dose as her physician said she should not get the second dose while on apixaban. The clinical outcome of &#34;after her 1st dose, she had an allergy so bad&#34; and &#34;swelling and hives all over body&#34; was unknown.  Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal relation and known safety profile of the vaccine, a causal relation between events allergy to vaccine, swelling, hives and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

Medical history included ongoing obesity from 2018 (onset was around time her husband died in 2018. She thinks she started getting more sedentary and picking up weight about then). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine and no additional vaccines administered on same date of the bnt162b2. The patient previously had smallpox vaccine for immunization when she was a child and that of which really worked, but it was not just a neat little thing and she still has the scar on her upper arm; and varicella zoster vaccine rge (cho) (SHINGRIX) on unspecified date in 2019 for immunization. She had quite a reaction to this first dose of SHINGRIX vaccine but cannot remember what the symptoms she had were; she was down for a few days with that. She told her family doctor about the reaction, and that she received the vaccine at (pharmacy name); the family doctor said she should not get the second dose of the SHINGRIX. On 20Jan2021, the patient experienced her injection site left arm turned &#34;kinda pinky/red and a little puffy, with a little heat/warm and tender to the touch.&#34; Outcome of the all the events was unknown.

She treated at home with benedryl and hydrocortisone.  On 2/13 she continued to have itching/rash and also developed a welt at the injection site. She visited the urgent care where she had an elevated blood pressure of 210/100 and 170/90. As an ICU nurse, I can attest that my mother?s blood pressure always runs in the 90s-100 systolic range. She received an injection of solumedrol and Benadryl orally and was given a prescription for prednisone for 3 days total.

The doctor said it was too far between the shot and the reactions for it to be the shot. She received the vaccine on 27Jan2021. On Saturday morning she took Vitamin D, B complex, Digoxin and Rosuvastatin. Twenty minutes later her chin felt funny. Her face was red and burning. She felt like she was going to faint. She got some ice and washed her face. She took 2 baby aspirin. She asked her doctor if she was allergic to the vaccine. Her doctor said the time between getting the vaccine and the events were too far between. She thought she was going to pass out. She felt better after washing her face with ice. She was her face for 30-45 minutes with ice water.  She took apixaban (ELIQUIS) before and her chin felt funny. She added that her blood pressure went up and she had trembles. She felt dizzy.

Lot: ABL8694A, Expiry: Dec2022, It came from another country. She was sure she was allergic to it because she had a rash. That was when she was switched to rivaroxaban.

She was worried and frightened at the time because something happened to her. She can&#39;t remember if her face was swollen. She drank some ice cold water and took two baby aspirins. She knew she needed to flush her system. She just wanted to make she was safe in getting the shot. Her doctor told her to take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) if she ever felt that way. She felt fine after getting the shot and the few days after getting it. She wanted to get the shot. Events resulted in physician office visit. The action taken in response to the events for vitamin D, vitamin b complex, digoxin, rosuvastatin was dose not changed.

An 83-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number EL9262, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 20Jan2021, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing allergies (She normally gets an allergy shot for mold and stuff. She had one 8 days prior to getting the vaccine. She has not gotten one since. She is due but she cannot get it until this clears up. She is unsure of the name of the allergy shot that she gets. She had all the allergy tests years ago and has been going for the last 4 years or so. For things like mold, dust, cockroaches, grass, and trees) for which receiving allergy shot, ongoing High blood pressure, ongoing Reflux, and ongoing Osteoporosis/osteopenia. Osteoporosis runs in her family, she does not have it yet but she had Osteopenia (She started young). Concomitant medications included Allergy shot (unspecified) for about 4 years for allergies, valsartan (Started about 5 or 6 years ago) orally at 160 mg, twice a day for high blood pressure, amlodipine (Started about 5 or 6 years ago), orally at 2.5 mg, once a day for High blood pressure, lansoprazole (PREVACID) (Started about 15-20 years ago) orally at 15 mg once a day for Reflux and ibandronate sodium (started about 10 years ago) via an unknown route, at 150 mg once a month for Osteoporosis/osteopenia; all were ongoing. Patient had the first shot of the vaccine last Tuesday. She stayed for half an hour and was fine. She left there and 10 minutes later while driving she started getting itchy around her face mask. She thought it was the mask irritating her skin. As the day progressed her cheeks and under her chin were getting red and itchy. She took Benadryl and the next day it got worse. She called the doctor and they put her on 20mg Prednisone two times a day. That was a week ago Tuesday. She called her allergist and he thought it was the poly glycol peg that is in the vaccine. He will test her after it is all out of her system. Both her regular doctor and her allergist told her not to take the second shot because it was too close a situation. She did not have an anaphylactic reaction, but if she had not jumped on it right away what could have happened. She is wondering if company has any data on the efficacy of the first shot if going on Prednisone right after? She started the Prednisone the next night. She is tapering off now. She still has a little bit of heat on her face and itching under the skin. So, apparently, she had an allergy to the vaccine and was told not to get the second shot. Patient clarified that she did not get the vaccine last Tuesday. She got the vaccine last Wednesday which was 20Jan2021. She said the reaction started about 40-45 minutes after receiving the dose. She has improved about 90% since starting the Prednisone. This morning her face is a little red. She is currently weaning off the Prednisone. Her face was red and it feels a little hot. She is down to 10mg twice a day. She had started the Prednisone the next day on 21Jan2021. She started the wean yesterday. This morning her face is a littler red on her cheeks. The vaccine seems to be taking a long time to get out of her system. NDC, lot, exp are unknown for the Prednisone as it is in a pharmacy vial. Her doctor told her to stop taking Benadryl as it does not stay in the system long enough. She says the Benadryl is not in a bottle, it is in a stupid little package. LOT: SMF001. EXP: May2022. Her doctor put her on Zyrtec twice a day instead. She started that on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Her son took her BP and it was extremely high and it was 119/68, pulse 112.   At 11:00 her BP was 108/59 with a pulse of 78.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

An 83-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 24Feb2021, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included mild asthma, dementia (moments like putting things in the wrong place and being forgetful) and was confused. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) received at age 83 years, on 03Feb2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. On 24Feb2021, after the second vaccinations, the patient&#39;s arm was sore. On 06Mar2021, the patient began just feeling bad, was having like a terrible time, having a hard time, was really not feeling good; was more confused; lethargic; had trouble getting her up, was having to do everything for her, feed her, bathe her; couldn&#39;t walk and lost her appetite. On 09Mar2021, the patient was shutting down. On the same day at 18:30, the patient had gone in the bathroom and said it burned when she peed. So, the patient was taken to urgent care so it would not get out of hand. At the urgent care, they said she has a UTI, there was blood in her urine so they gave her Cipro but they cultured her urine and it grew no bacteria but there was still blood in her urine and she was getting worse with sleeping and she didn&#39;t even get up to eat. The patient was also dehydrated and her urine was dark. The events dehydrated, urine was dark, it burned when she peed, blood in her urine required emergency visit on 16Mar2021.

They did a CT scan of the head and chest to look for stroke or seizure and there was nothing. They blamed it on her dementia that had suddenly progressed. The patient was hospitalized from 16Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. On 12Mar2021, the patient experienced cellulitis in her arm. The reporter clarified that the cellulitis was further down her arm, around her wrist hand area. Her wrist was huge, hot, red, and her hand was swollen. On 24Mar2021, the patient followed up with the family doctor because the hospital wanted her to follow up with a GYN because they didn&#39;t feel it was urinary at all. When the reporter took the patient in to see the doctor, she couldn&#39;t walk in, she had to roll her in a wheelchair, she had stopped talking again. On 26Mar2021, the doctor sent the patient to the emergency room (unspecified reason) and they kept her. They said her said lactic acid was high. She was admitted on 26Mar2021 and discharged on 29Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s potassium was 3.3 and her lactic acid level was back to 2.

An 84-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 12Jan2021 14:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On Jan2021, her left arm was blue from her shoulder to her elbow and almost the whole circumference going under her arm. On Jan2021, she has a slight left arm swelling and left arm discomfort. The discomfort was bearable. The discoloration of her left arm has become bad. She was at the COVID-19 vaccine clinic, some nurses looked at her arm, and insisted she contact Pfizer and her doctor to report what happened to her arm. She has an appointment with her doctor the afternoon of 20Jan2021. Her second COVID-19 vaccine dose is scheduled on 02Feb2021. Her left arm swelling and discomfort is the same now, but her left arm discoloration is awful. Her left arm discoloration is the only change she has experienced since her first report. Her left arm discoloration is what she calls &#34;puce&#34;, clarifying hers is a purple, black, and blue color. The discoloration of her left arm is uncanny. The discoloration stops before her left elbow like a completely straight line drawn by a ruler. The discoloration continues from her left elbow up to her left shoulder for which the discoloration spreads out unevenly. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported events based on the known safety profile and temporal association   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

An 85-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249) at the age of 84-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, diabetes, and allergies. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient got the COVID vaccine on 18Jan2021 and she has been okay until last week. The patient has broken out in welts all over her body and was itching like absolute crazy on Jan2021. She went to her doctor on Friday but couldn&#39;t see him because he had too many people, but she asked a PA (as reported) to tell the doctor to see him. The doctor wanted to know what she has done. She mentioned that she has been at her house ever since last March because of the virus. She hasn&#39;t even been to a grocery store or anywhere. She was given ZYRTEC, PEPCID, and something to put on, it&#39;s Triamcinolone to put on twice a day. She mentioned that Triamcinolone has been helping her since Friday, but now it&#39;s not doing a thing. She was just scratching. Her face was red as a bee and she even got it on her legs and arm. It started on her hands and now, it was going up her arms. This started a week ago (Jan2021). She was suffering from the symptoms, all her feet and legs were covered with white, itch spots and they all go together. She mentioned that she was going to see another doctor tomorrow or go to the hospital or somewhere again. She couldn&#39;t stand this and added that you don&#39;t understand how serious this is. She was supposed to get the second shot tomorrow and mentioned that she was afraid to get it. The patient underwent lab test and procedure which included A1C with an unknown result on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She doesn&#39;t even know if it is a rash. She hasn&#39;t had any side effects. Her arm didn&#39;t even hurt. This little rash is only on her neck. She had worked as a dental assistant. She is just worried now about getting the second shot. The outcome of event for itchy and worried was unknown and for other events it was not recovered.

Concomitant medication included diltiazem, estradiol, pantoprazole, and atorvastatin calcium (ATORVAS). On 22Jan2021, the patient had a reaction to her first dose of vaccination, and she was wondering if that would be a problem when she takes the second dose.

                                                On Thursday evening, after getting the vaccine on Monday, I had a rash on both legs and both arms. It did not break the skin and was not uncomfortable.  I took an Advil PM about an hour before I noticed the rash.  That was 7 days ago, and I still see a light rash on my legs and arms.  It is much better.  No treatments other than taking a couple of Benedryl during that time.

A little white dot appeared where needle was inserted. Arm swelled. Initially thought it was common. But was not getting better and was painful and made her not feel well. She went to the doctors thankfully a few days after and was advised that it was infected. Could have been dangerous for her if infection continued to move through her body.   She is now on antibiotics. This is strange to have an infection which makes us feel the needle was not properly sterilized? Something foreign entered at the time of that shot and we would like to have answers. The doctors could not even identify why this happened.  Company Pfizer..

An 85-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot# EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 09:15 (at the age of 85-years-old) in right arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient had allergies and asthma for years. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported she got her first COVID-19 Vaccine on Saturday, 20Feb2021. She said she developed a rash on Monday (22Feb2021), and was very itchy. She said she didn&#39;t have the rash on her legs. She said she had the feeling of needles all over her entire body and face, along with a hot feeling on 22Feb2021. She said she was contributing her rash to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She asked if she got the second COVID-19 Vaccine, would the rash occur again, and would the rash be worse. The caller said she was scheduled to receive her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose on Thursday, 11Mar2021. The caller was advised she would be transferred to Pfizer Medical Information for further assistance. She had macular degeneration and had difficulty seeing in Feb2021. She clarified she felt like her face had needles going through it. She said her neck, chest, and upper back are a purple-red color on 22Feb2021. She said she was so uncomfortable that it was hard for her to wear clothes, and she had to sleep in the nude. Treatment: she was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and her daughter gave her an over-the-counter cortisone cream in a tube to use for her rash. She said she just started using the cortisone cream today (25Feb2021). She said she did not have the Benadryl and cortisone cream tube with her to provide the UPC/NDC Numbers, Lot Numbers, and Expiration Dates. She planned to call her doctor to see if he will give her something for the rash once she was finished speaking with Pfizer. The events did not require emergency room or physician office. Outcome of macular degeneration and difficulty seeing was unknown, and outcome of other events were not recovered.

                                                fainted; passed out and was unconscious; still kind of feel weak; bruise on both knees; fall; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable registered nurse (patient, Retired RN). An 85-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at single dose via an unknown route injection in left arm on 23Jan2021 around 08:15 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high which was controlled with medication, allergic to penicillin and acetylsalicylic acid;ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN).  She had lost weight and shrunk according to when she went to the doctor 2 months ago. No other products were taken. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect; no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine, no events following prior vaccinations. No family medical history relevant to the events. Patient passed out on her way home on 23Jan2021 (unknown time). The event required a visit to Emergency room, but not a Physician office. The event clinical course was as follows: She got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. Patient reported that after being monitored at the vaccination site for 20minutes, she left to go catch the bus and fainted before boarding the bus.  She remembered getting on the bus, but did not remember crossing the street. She passed out and was unconscious. An ambulance was called and they took her back to the hospital where she got the vaccine. She was taken by ambulance back to the ER, stayed for half the day, she received IV fluids, and a brain scan due to her fall. She stated that she still feels kind of weak as of 29Jan2021.  She did not know what time it happened, because she lost her sense of time on that day because she did not remember. When she got to the hospital she woke up and wondered where she was because she did not remember what happened. They got an x-ray of her head to see if she had bumped it, but it was negative. She did have a bruise on both knees. They gave her IV fluids, and kept her there for a little while, then sent her home. She called her doctor the next day, but he was busy, so she talked to the nurse. No treatment was recommended, just said to get a lot of rest. She was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 13Feb2021 and was scared to death. Patient verified that she was not admitted to the hospital. Investigation assessment were performed. They hooked her up to the monitor, did an x-ray and a CT scan while at the hospital on 23Jan2021 which were normal (both fine), and gave her IV fluids. Outcome of fainted, fall, passed out and was unconscious was resolved on 23Jan2021. Outcome of kind of feel weak was not resolved. Outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainted and unconscious cannot be fully excluded.  The underlying history of high blood pressure for this 85 years old patient  might provide an alternative explanation.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry.

Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs.

Then, her blood pressure went up to 170, the patient was given lots of continuous water and blood pressure pill. She started to feel better after that. The reporter further stated, &#34;She has had various different problems. I do not know if it is allergies or what from what she already has but she did have a lot of it and exhausting stuff afterwards. There is mainly that choking feeling that is frightening that she had one hour after&#34;. It was also reported that the patient developed some rash on her back and hives on her legs. It was not right away. It was kind of a day or two after. The outcome of events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts needed. Further information is expected.

A 86-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm (right upper arm) on 03Feb2021 08:50 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history included aspirin exacerbated upper respiratory disease from an unknown date to ongoing and asthma from an unknown date to ongoing and breast cancer. She had family history included diabetes (Father died of a brain hemorrhage at 86). She had historical vaccine as flu vaccine in Oct2020 or Nov2020. There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). There were no concomitant medications. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 03Feb2021, patient experienced itch on her left wrist and injection site was slightly swollen/elevated about 3inches in diameter and about 1 cc high. She stated got the shot today (03Feb2021) and the 2 things she experienced after she got the shot. First she felt an itch on her left wrist immediately but it was given in the right arm. She notes she looked at it and it was red but gradually went down over 15 minutes. Also the injection site was slightly swollen. The itching felt like a pimple when she looked at it she described it as redness that followed the vein and muscle. It lasted about 20 minutes and is back to normal now. At the time, maybe it was swollen. She had been told to stay for half an hour and she did that due to having aspirin exacerbated upper respiratory disease and asthma. She has been a patient in the allergy unit and check with them before getting the shot and was told it was ok to get. It was given about 8:50am. When she got home she looked at the place she was given and it was slightly swollen around the injection site. She always gets shots in right arm due to having breast cancer. It was seen about 10 minutes ago for the first time and was not red but elevated about 3 inches in diameter and about 1 cc high. There was no emergency room or physician office visit. She will be getting amoxicillin when she gets a dental appointment but she has not taken or started that at this point. No treatment was received, she just hung around for a little more than a half hour, showed to the nurse who thought she was ok, she has had no fever or other issues. The caller explained she stayed out of work on Monday and Tuesday to insure she wasn&#39;t upset or getting any infection. She is prone to get sinus infections that affects her ear canals and that cause dizziness. She has had no dizziness. The outcome of event for vaccination site swelling was not recovered and for localised itching it was recovered.

Even though all this happened I would go through with it again. The injection site hurt the next day and it went away.

She described her vision going black. She said that she did not eat today at her normal times which could have contributed to the event. She is asking if the vaccine could have had anything to do with this?  She has not had a previous episode like this before. She did have some minor injection site pain at the time of the vaccine but that has subsided.  Follow-up call with patient on 1/30/31 at 19:37: Spoke to the patient. She is feeling better today.  She did not see her doctor or go to the ED. She checked her glucose yesterday and it was high. She said she thinks her symptoms were from not eating her normal meals around the time of the vaccine.

                                                rash that looks like measles; rash on right side that goes around to back looks like diaper rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist.  An 87-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was none.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated she had this injection 08Jan2021, states the following Thursday, 14Jan2021, she broke out with 2 different reactions, a rash that looks like measles all over, the second reaction is part on her back looks like a little kid has not had their diaper changed, like diaper rash, like half a belt from the right side to the back. States she is very concerned, the patient went to a dermatologist who she had a lot of faith in, doctor met her at the door, read about it but has never seen a reaction like this. States that they injected her with something and it worked in two different places. States she did a biopsy on her hip and took movies to show her students, called her and stated she need to report this event. The patient states she wants to know if she should get the second vaccine. States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine. The patient last night to report but she could not get through. Stated she got injection on right arm. The patient stated the rashes are trying to improve. States the rash that looks like measles started on the right side and now is all over. The patient stated she is allergic to bromines and swims in a bromine salt water heated swimming pool and this has nothing to do with it but the point she is saying is that she says your allergic to things and then not have reactions and sometimes you do. Both events were serious with criteria of medially signicant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included biopsy: unknown results, body height: 5 foot 2 inches (States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine).  The outcome of the event rash that looks like measles was not recovered, while the outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient reported dizziness and a fainting episode the morning after her immunization. She knew she was getting dizzy and she attempted to get into her recliner, but fell into her recliner and injured her rib and possibly her &#39;tailbone&#39;. She went to the Emergency Department  where she was examined and scans were taken of her ribs. She was determined to have &#39;bruised&#39; ribs and sent home with advice to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen alternately every 4 hours for pain relief. She has been at home since this episode. We only found out about this adverse event this week when we called her to confirm her second immunization. She reported this fall to us and was reluctant to get the second shot. I reported the event to her provider, and now to you at VAERS.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 07:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, bypass in 2010, hearing is very bad on the phone, arthritis pain, headache, and blood thinner. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included metoprolol for hypertension, quinapril for hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) for hypertension, ascorbic acid/ calcium/ minerals NOS/ retinol/ tocopheryl acetate/ vitamin B NOS/ vitamins NOS/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER), calcium carbonate (CALTRATE), atorvastatin, warfarin as blood thinner, spironolactone, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) for arthritis pain and headache; all were ongoing. The patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and had reactions to the vaccine or something else. That day, the patient&#39;s left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain), but that was expected, and it went away within 2 days (initially didn&#39;t report it because it was expected). Yesterday (18Jan2021), the patient experienced dizziness and pain in the lower extremities. Last night (18Jan2021; about 6 days after the injection), the patient woke up, felt poorly, and was very dizzy (feeling of dizziness), then, later on, had pain in both lower extremities. The patient took her blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly with result of 159. The patient&#39;s heart rate, temperature, and pulse oximetry were okay on 18Jan2021. She then walked to the bathroom, came back, and went back into bed. The second time she said her legs hurt but this morning she is feeling better than she was. Today (19Jan2021), the pain in feet is better, and the dizziness is gone. Pulse oximetry and temperature were okay this morning (19Jan2021). The patient was wondering if these effects could be related to the vaccine, since the dose was received 6 days ago. The patient was not sure if could possibly be related to the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was that she spent a lot of time doing paperwork on the computer yesterday (18Jan2021) and perhaps that caused some of the symptoms. The patient&#39;s sister called to ask if Pfizer has heard of any late adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccine like this patient&#39;s, 6 days later. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 04Feb2021 (day 22) and her sister asked what if it&#39;s not available. The patient&#39;s sister was concerned about interval and potentially being unable to gain access to the second dose due to supply issues. The patient recovered from &#34;Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain)&#34; on 15Jan2021; and from &#34;Dizziness&#34; on 19Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the other events.

An 88-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 11:45 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung cancer. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient had unspecified other medication in two weeks. The reporter&#39;s mother&#39;s experienced mild allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she wants to know whether or not she should be getting her second dose. She will be asking her doctor as well as they were advised by the nurse administering the vaccine and also the doctor&#39;s nurses who observed her mother afterwards, but she was also advised to contact Pfizer. On 20Jan2021, at 12:00, within 5 minutes, the patient experienced flushed in the face/warm, red face, tingling sensation of lips but no swelling, no increased blood pressure, no hives or rash, no tongue or throat swelling, no dizziness, no nausea. It was mild but concerning. The patient was treated with oral Benadryl and Pepcid IV (also reported as IV of peptids), and extended observation for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had no Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The consumer would like to know if her mother was safe to receive the second dose of the Covid vaccine and if the reaction to the second dose of the Covid vaccine will be more severe with a history of an allergic reaction to the first dose. Outcome of event mild allergic reaction was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was recovered in Jan2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                My mother had an &#34;adverse event&#34; to the first dose of the Covid-19 PFIZER  mRNA vaccine. Her whole upper arm became swollen (inflammation) and somewhat &#34;hot to the touch&#34; and was reddish in coloring. The inflammation did NOT look like a golf ball, but rather like a small hill on her upper arm, with a slope. After that, she reported to me .... that she was getting &#34;winded&#34;, on walks with her best friend. They both live in a senior citizen residence center, which is NOT an &#34;assisted living&#34; facility. Now, the swelling (inflammation) is gone. My mother has now had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and yesterday .... she did NOT report, any adverse reactions (yet) from her second injection.

Then, on 2/19 she developed epistaxis, brusining, and petechiae.   She had labs drawn by a local provider and platelet count was 7.   (baseline, even on chemotherapy for her AML is in the normal range).   Therefore, she reported to a local health center and a recheck of the platelet count was &lt;3k.     WBC and Hb were within normal range.   No circulating blasts or other evidence of AML.  No recent infections or other exposures.   That center reached out for transfer to our hospital as we initially diagnosed and treated her AML.  I advised dexamethasone 40mg and transfer (they also transfused 5u platelets prior to her departure)  Upon arrival at our center about 12hrs later, platelet count was 210 and on 2 rechecks it has remained in the normal range while continuing dexamethasone 40mg daily.   Bleeding symptoms ceased and she was discharged in stable condition.  She plans to return back to home after discharge with repeat lab testing later this week after stopping steroids.   Chemotherapy to be held at least one extra week to ensure stability.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 89-years-old female patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (by injection once to left arm) on 22Jan2021 COVID-19 immunization since patient was in an independent facility with 238 residents. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. She said she got her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on a Friday. She said she had no pain in her arm after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, but then on 26Jan2021 she noticed about 8 hives right at her waist line. She asked if the hives were a reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her skin was red and puffy in 8 different places on her waistline. She said her skin on her waistline looks like what happens when being allergic to something. She said she lives in an independent living community, and the COVID-19 Vaccine was provided to the residents in a group setting. She said no COVID-19 Vaccine immunization cards were provided at the time of vaccination. Patient reported &#34;you know when the person gets hives, you get blisters, red blisters and now they are getting worse&#34; and asked if that was a side effect from the vaccine.&#34; She was fine for a couple days, then noticed, and she doesn&#39;t know if this is a side effect or not, the waistline, she has about 5, states &#34;you know when a person gets hives in the skin, it is raised and red? Is that a side effect?&#34; States she shrunk (onset date not reported). There was a doctor there she would see her week and would show her, she will be giving her a physical. Patient would try to get physical therapy there. She further stated it looks like hives, she was looking now, she has 8 hives, they were the same color, and it was also itchy. She was not given a vaccine card. She was brought into a dining room, one area aside, there was a nurse, and applications already filled out, she has no idea what her number was, but after the injection she was put in another room, and sat for 15 minutes, to make sure no reaction, and there wasn&#39;t, she had no pain in arm, she felt well, but this showed up. She has to go back in 3 weeks for second injection. No investigation assessment was performed. The outcome of shrunk was unknown and not recovered (ongoing) for the other events. Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.
