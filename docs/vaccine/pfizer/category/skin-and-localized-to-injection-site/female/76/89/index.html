I apparently had my left hand under me when I fell because I broke the knuckle under the pinkie of my left hand.

Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid getting lazy and does not work, vitamins, and sulfa drugs for bladder infection. It was reported that after getting the first dose of the vaccine the patient noticed she had pustules across her back on an unspecified date. The patient stated she &#34;got this rash from the tips of fingers, even the palm of my hands and it starts right under the neck and goes across my breast, on my belly, on my back and both arms and is now halfway down my shin bone.&#34; On an unspecified date in Jan2021, she noticed this the afternoon of her vaccine around 7:00 when she saw two splotches on her stomach and it kept spreading. Sunday morning she went to Quick Care and yesterday went to her regular doctor. Her doctor gave her prednisone to take 10 mg 4 times a day, and hydroxyzine 10 mg for itching. In her throat she was getting hoarse on an unspecified date and was keeping a water bottle on her desk to keep hydrated. She stated she read on (website) that a rash can be a symptom of the vaccine. The caller asked, &#34;if the pustules burst will this cause anyone to get Covid 19? Is this a possible side effect of the vaccine? How long will this last? Is it okay to get my second shot with this reaction? Is there anything I should be taking to make it go away?&#34; It was further reported that patient received paperwork to call if there was any type of reaction. The patient mentioned she has a rash that was all over her body on 28Jan2021. It was on the top of her hands, in the palm of her hands, on her arms, back, under her breast, on her chest, on her stomach, on her bottom end, it was going down her legs and to her knees at this point. The patient initially stated she noticed the rash on Friday (29Jan2021), she later stated it was Thursday 28Jan2021 when the rash first started. She stated she first noticed splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist on an unspecified date in Jan2021. At first when looking at it she did not think too much about it. Later in the call she further clarified and stated it was possible she noticed these splotches the same day in the evening on the day she got the vaccine. She was not sure. If it was not the same day it was the next day. Friday (29Jan2021), she started to get as initially stated bumps, but later clarified rash under skin and it really proceeded from there. Additionally, it was reported that the rash continued to spread throughout her whole body. It was down to her shin now. Her whole upper body was horrible. She has some across her back. There are pustules on them like a pimple. It was like water in it ready to break. Sunday she went to a (clinic name) to get it looked at. She went Sunday 31Jan2021. She was given an intravenous (IV) and three needles were placed in it. She knows one was a steroid, she does not know what the other two were for, but she thinks one was probably for itching. The patient also confirmed she also experienced itching with the rash on 28Jan2021. It started the same day she noticed the rash. The patient stated it was like a full blown case now. The itching was with the rash on 28Jan2021. The itching and rash has continued to go down her body. It was on her buttocks now. It was hard to sit. It was in private up between her legs and stuff. Her body was almost 80 % full and covered with this stuff. She saw her regular doctor yesterday. The doctor at (clinic name) thought this reaction may have been an allergic reaction to a Sulfa drug she was taking for a bladder infection coincidentally at the same time, but she does not believe this was the case. Stated she had taken that sulfa drug before previously. She does not have the name of the drug to provide of the sulfa drug. She does not have it with her. No blood work was done. She was just looked at. They saw what was going on. The patient also mentioned she went on the internet to do research. She saw on Pfizer page three pictures that resembled what she had going on. It was also reported that the two splotches on right hand side started about 7&#39;clock in the evening. At first did not think anything of it. Thought it was possibly a bug bite at first. Additionally, it was reported that patient went to see a doctor. She was already going to the doctor for a bone density scan and she showed the doctor what was going on at the same time. Her primary doctor thought this was due to the COVID 19 Vaccine. At end of call, patient questioned &#34;if the pustules across upper back and behind neck, will that cause anyone to get COVID 19? Side effect?&#34; The patient had no emergency visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of itching with the rash, rash that is all over her body, and two splotches on right hand side. The patient had not yet recovered from rash that is all over her body while outcome of the events pustules, itching with the rash, in her throat she is getting hoarse, and &#34;splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist /Two splotches on right hand side&#34; was unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL3246, via an unspecified route of administration to left arm from 02Jan2021 to 02Jan2021 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included spinal surgery and surgical wound, a 7 inch scar along her back/she had spinal surgery and has a 7 inch scar, she had no problems.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported a rash that developed after receiving vaccine on 02Jan2021.  On 03Jan2021, her rash occurred on a recent surgical wound, a 7 inch scar along her back.  The rash also developed on the back crease of her legs and neck.  She has been managing her symptoms with Benadryl. The patient was asking is others has reported this side effect. The patient is also asking if she can get the second dose of the vaccine. Her surgeon suggested perhaps not receiving second vaccine. It was further reported as, &#34;got Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on Saturday. Next day had a severe rash that got worse. Saw her general practitioner this morning and got steroids to help with itching. No further details provided, wants to know if she should forgo the second shot. The patient stated she was fortunate to get the Pfizer vaccine, later clarified as Pfizer COVID vaccine, Saturday in the early am, then on Sunday, developed a rash over part of her body, she can control with Benadryl, the itching, but the weird part, is a month ago, she had spinal surgery and has a 7 inch scar, she had no problems, like no reaction to glue, but the rash is concentrated down both sides of the scar. She had an appointment with her surgeon today, and showed it to him, since she thought it was unusual, and he said she may not want to take the second dose, it was not a terrible rash all over her body, mainly concentrated to the area of her back, and it is like a little bit on the back of her neck, not even anything she would notice, but it is there. The patient stated she can&#39;t get through to the Health Department, and she has a card to say to have the second dose on 23Jan2020, but she can&#39;t get through. States thanks so much, this is a miracle event and in a year&#39;s time, even if she did get a rash. The rash is a little more pronounced, but she has been rubbing it trying to not scratch, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be spreading any at all. States she is healthy. Seeking more information about getting the second dose after experiencing a rash. The outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                After a few days, muscle/joint pain ....headaches.....Tiredness......injection sit pain.... all were bearable and strong to disappear when i waek after the short I got Horrible chills, completely out of control, had to wear my night guard to stop teeth from getting chipped, lasted 3 or four hours. Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number was either: EL1283, CL1283, or LL1283) on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took pneumonia shot on an unknown date and flu shot in Oct2020 for immunization. Patient got the first dose of the vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 in the morning. On 11Jan2021 her arm felt tender where the needle went in.On 12Jan2021 late afternoon, she started getting hissing in her ear that was still there and had not gone away at all and she also had a constant humming in her right ear. By 13Jan2021, she still had the humming.  She saw an ENT on 13Jan2021 and doctor didn&#39;t know if it was correlated to the vaccine or not; doctor took some wax out of her ear and she seemed to get relief from the hissing for about 15 minutes but about 15-20 minutes later the hissing/ humming continued. On 14Jan2021, woke up with complete deafness in right ear. Immediately called ENT doctor and did a hearing test. Patient could not hear and they confirmed she had sudden hearing loss in her right ear on 14Jan2021, she had nothing in her right ear (as reported). They put her on 40 mg a day of Prednisone (20mg tablets) and so far, prednisone hadn&#39;t done anything: originally taking prednisone 40mg for four days and was taking two a day;  on 16Jan2021 when she was getting no relief and couldn&#39;t sleep due to the humming in her ear, she called doctor and was advised to take the 40mg together in the morning, she will take 40mg a day. On 19Jan2021 she took 20mg for four days and then decreased by half again. She was also advised by doctor to take 25mg Benadryl (UPC: 30048284 Lot: SPS023 Exp: Jun2022) at night. They are scheduling her for an MRI in Jan2021.Patient was also scheduled for the second dose on 01Feb2021 and will be on the prednisone until 26Jan2021; she would like to know whether the prednisone will diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine. She also asked  if there was a certain amount of time she should wait to restart in case the doctor decided she should not get the second dose; she also wanted to know if she should wait on the second vaccine and maybe start over in two months.She was concerned and wanted to know if she should proceed with the second shot. The patient underwent blood work on an unspecified date to see if she can receive contrast for an MRI. She never had problem with MRI contrast before. Final outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN5318, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 28Jan2021 17:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Medical history included ongoing macular degeneration and thyroid disorder. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine for thyroid and ascorbic acid, tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc (AREDS). The patient got the vaccine on Thursday 28Jan2021. Thursday and Friday she was fine. However, Saturday morning (30Jan2021) when she woke up she had two red welts, almost like hives on her body and a little bit of itching. Then, the wee hours of yesterday morning (Sunday morning) both arms near her wrist area only were itching like crazy. She was calling to see if it would be okay to take Benadryl for the itching. No one she has called yet has been able to answer her question. She tried contacting the hospital where she got the vaccine. The patient further reported that she noticed the two red welts like hives on her body on Saturday in the morning (30Jan2021) when she woke up, exact time not specified. This has gone away. It went away sometime yesterday (31Jan2021). These were also itchy. She noticed the inside of her arm by the wrist area in the early morning hours yesterday were extremely itchy. She thought for sure she would wake up with red welts but there wasn&#39;t any. Her arms are fine. Now, her back was itchy. Her back now was the only thing now really itching. She placed Cortisone cream on her back and it helped. Her back was still a little itchy, but not as bad. The patient scheduled for her second dose on 18Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of itching/both arms near her wrist area only were itching like crazy/her back was itchy. On 31Jan2021, the patient recovered from &#34;two red welts, almost like hives on her body&#34; and was recovering from itching.

Medical history included lymphoma from May2020, had chemotherapy for lymphoma from Jun2020 to 08Oct2020, shingles, knee replacement from 2008 and allergic to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she thinks she was having side effects from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine she got 19Jan2021, tomorrow 02Feb2020 was two weeks from when she got it. Patient didn&#39;t have any side effects to start with, just soreness to the injection site on Jan2021. She says last Wednesday, 27Jan2021, she noticed she had hives, not a rash, on her chest on the left side that are kind of on her breast, the top of her breast, which now spread under her arm up to her shoulder area and back. There was pain along with it, a burning sensation starting last night on 31Jan2021 in the inside area. Since she got her injection on her left side, she doesn&#39;t know if this could be a reaction to the injection or not. She had shingles several years ago, this was acting like that, and it looked like one of the side effects listed is lymphadenopathy, which she looked up information about that, but she doesn&#39;t know what it was, she doesn&#39;t know what else to blame it on. Patient hasn&#39;t seen her doctor yet for hives, and has not treated the hives. She got the OK from the nurse who said she didn&#39;t see a reason for her not to get the vaccine since she was coming off chemo several months prior. Patient was considered to be in remission right now, and she has an appointment next week with her oncologist for follow up. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL8982), intramuscular on the left arm at the age of 77 years, on 27Jan2021 11:30 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization and cefuroxime axetil (CEFUROXIME AXETIL), oral from 25Jan2021 to Jan2021 at 250 mg, 2x/day (250mg tablet, one tablet twice a day by mouth ) for urinary tract infection. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed many years ago, ongoing rash because she was still having a problem in her pubic area with a rash that is going on, states this is from the urinary tract infection and urinary tract infection from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. When she got the vaccine she was on an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection (UTI), she is asking if there would be any correlation or any interaction between the antibiotic and the vaccine. The antibiotic was something she has taken quite often and has taken it before called cefuroxime axetil. Concomitant medication included insulin (INSULIN) for diabetes. The patient developed itching throughout her body, like hives that started late Friday (29Jan2021) and she will get areas on her hands and arms. This morning it was on her legs where it was red and warm. She reported it goes away and comes back. This morning the hives were fairly heavy and now that she has gotten up and cooled her body down, the hives were subsiding. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration upper arm probably only about 4inches down from shoulder blade on the left on 12Jan2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID on 01Oct2020. Concomitant medication included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) as blood thinner. The patient previously took a flu and shingles shot and experienced her redness and swelling on her arm. The patient did not have vaccinations four weeks prior, and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. She got it because she was told by her doctor that her antibodies will not last forever and it was still necessary to get it even though she already had COVID antibodies. She contracted COVID on 01Oct2020, that was the date when she had a positive test then she was last tested in December and she still had the antibodies then. She received her first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday 12Jan2021 and 24 hours later on 13Jan2021, she experienced chills and feeling very hot, which she took Tylenol extra strength for and it disappeared the next day. Her arm also swelled, not the whole arm, she would say about 3 inches around the site, 4 inches at the most and it was still swollen, it was red and itchy. Then she woke up in a horrible sweat but by the following morning it was gone. She wouldn&#39;t say it was a horrible reaction but she wanted to be certain she can go ahead and get the second shot which she had an appointment for. She said everything has resolved completely except for the swelling, her arm was still swollen, itchy, and red. Since the swelling, redness and itchiness began she would say it was slightly better than it was. The patient received the vaccine at an independent assisted living facility, not a military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events chills, feeling very hot and woke up in a horrible sweat was recovered on 14Jan2021, while the remaining events was recovering.

Medical history included neuropathy in feet, cholesterol (abnormal), 2 vertebra in her back that are starting to fuse, shrinking as she&#39;s getting older, allergic to NSAIDS, she clarifies Advil, Tylenol and the medications reverses on her and gives her a headache, and she gets itchy; was in the hospital for surgery, for lady stuff and needs glasses. She doesn&#39;t have a heart problem she doesn&#39;t have any other medical issues. She&#39;s not diabetic the neuropathy was idiopathic.  Concomitant medications included atorvastatin for cholesterol (abnormal), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA). The patient previously took morphine and was allergic, and hallucinating as she was told by the nurse, she said there were monkeys on the ceiling and her husband was trying to kill her and gets itchy with morphine. This is the same reaction she had when found out she had the reaction to NSAIDs, for example, she could take Advil or Tylenol for one night but it she took it two nights, that was when she woke up itching all over. She reports no rash, just itch. It just lasted that one night and it was gone. She could take some Advil and get that itchy feeling. On 01Mar2021, the patient experienced left arm aching from the site of the injection back down under the back of her arm to the back part of her elbow, then it comes to the far outer part of her forearm down to the wrist and ring finger and pinky finger; numbness down left arm/it was also partially numb, she has feeling because it&#39;s aching and she was describing it as an ache, not sharp just an ache. She can feel it, but its not all there. She knows all this stuff was new to all of us. She&#39;s following up and doesn&#39;t keep her up at night it&#39;s just not normal; and on 24Feb2021, her torso, the night after injection, from her armpits to her hips was itchy. She woke up and she went to the bathroom scratching her back and stomach. Her Covid 19 vaccine card was handwritten she sees 23Feb2021 and that&#39;s the date she got the shot. She&#39;s been isolating since Feb2020. She was only going out for necessity. She took a risk and had family at her home for Christmas. She hasn&#39;t been to church in almost a year, so she was taking this very seriously. Before they even started telling you to wear a mask she was listening to the news in December and January. She states, alright she&#39;s isolating, it&#39;s the safest thing she can do she&#39;s not ready to leave this world yet even knowing she&#39;s past her golden years. Her doctor put her on Atorvastatin it because of her age, she had blood drawn but she wasn&#39;t given any counts on an unspecified date. Her first thought was she had a chest problem but it&#39;s not a heart attack, the ache doesn&#39;t go any farther than what she told. It&#39;s not stopping her from being productive, from doing things. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room, physician office and was not hospitalized. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no events following prior vaccinations. Outcome of event itchy torso from armpits to hips/itchy back and stomach was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

She reported that the pain or little discomfort she had in the arm she received the injection in disappeared by 25Dec2020. But on 24Dec2020 she started to get very sick, which continued to worsen until now when she felt like she was improving. She did not know if these events could have something to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Pain or little discomfort in the arm she received the injection: Right arm. Everyone warned her that the site would hurt, so she was really glad when it totally went away on 25Dec2020 and thought that it was over; any issues from the injection. Very sick: this event started to get bad on 24Dec2020, she was very tired and not very hungry, she had stomach and abdominal pains and loose stool; 25Dec2020 those symptoms were  worse. It was Christmas so she cooked and thought at first maybe she got carried away baking pies; because that evening she started to have pain and did not each much. 26Dec2020 it was worse; she said she was going to work on 27Dec2020; it was terrible because she was stuck for 12 hours trying to work while very sick. She called off of work 28Dec2020 and 29Dec2020. Since then she has stayed home and still has pain but she took her ranitidine delayed release 100mg twice daily as needed for stomach pain as given to her by her doctor, and is now down to just once daily. She did not know what she would have done without the ranitidine. She did not have any more abdominal pain, but her stomach was still very sensitive. She was tired but thought she was going to be ok. She was scared to get the second scheduled dose of COVID-19 Vaccine because she thought the side effects will be more severe with the booster shot. She just needed to rest and stay home which she has been doing. She has not had any fever. She has not notified her family doctor of these events. There was nothing she did on Christmas that she could think of other than she drank a glass of champagne because she did not know her stomach was going to be so bad. The outcome of the events Pain or little discomfort in the arm she received the injection was recovered on 25Dec2020, the outcome of event sickness was recovering, the outcome of the event Abdominal pain was recovered on an unknown date in Dec2020, the outcome of event stomach pain was not recovered, the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                I am having rash development on both upper front thighs, chest stomach and back.  Itch a little but little red spots are visible.  Never have had an allergy or allergic reaction all my life to anything.  The only thing different done since new year is the Covid-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) was the vaccine.  It was my first dose and questioning whether to do 2nd vaccination.  If I am allergic to the synthetic vaccine...I am uncertain about taking the 2nd dose which could catastrophically cause more problems as in constriction of breathing, rashes , death etc.  I am due for 2nd dose on 01/28/21.  I would appreciate input as to whether i should receive 2nd dose; and i wanted to report my adverse affect which i am still having.  Thank you.

My arm starting hurting &amp; a few days later, I broke out with tiny dark red spots inside a red swollen circle.  Arm remained with a burning aching pain. My dermatologist said it was definately shingles &amp; prescribed a 10 day treatment of antiviral medication.  She didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine but  should report this.   The shingles are just below the shot area.

                                                Asthma attack began about 20 minutes after injection, with throat tightening, slight mouth swelling sensation and immediate wheezing which grew progressively worse.  I had my inhalers (Levalbuterol and Flovent) with me, used Levalbuterol at the direction of medical people who surrounded me after I reported wheezing.  They gave me a Benadryl, then brought a wheel chair and sent me directly to the ER.  I was there about 3 hours during which I had a heart monitor,  a &#34;breathing treatment&#34; by a respiratory therapist, and DUONEB, famotidine (PEPCID), and (DELTASONE). I was given a 3 day Rx for 20 mg. of prednisone, and released.  My lungs felt &#34;twitchy&#34; the next day and my voice was muted, but was well otherwise.   The only &#34;normal&#34; side effect I had was some soreness at the injection site for a couple of days, with some light sensitivity there for a few weeks.

The patient previously took dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride (DARVON), ether and castor oil and experienced allergies; sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) for severe acute sinusitis on Jan2021 (about a month ago). On 11Feb2021 at 13:20, the patient start feeling dizzy and faint like, and felt a little tired. She came home and went to bed and on 11Feb2021, had itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine) and on the right side of the arm near the elbow, the middle part of the stomach and the neck (itching came and went) and later, her sinuses started to drain. On 12Feb2021, the patient&#39;s feet felt stiff and the bone in the right leg felt strange. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient had pain in the shoulder. The patient queried if she can take aspirin for the pain in the shoulder and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) if the itching comes back. The clinical outcome of pain in the shoulder was unknown, of &#34;itching on right side of arm near elbow, middle part of stomach and neck&#34;, &#34;feeling dizzy and faint like&#34;, tired, sinuses started to drain, &#34;feet felt stiff and bone in right leg felt strange&#34; and &#34;itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine)&#34; was resolving.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EN6200) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies, hip surgery, and foot surgery three times. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. Patient reported she has been so sick. She got the shot on Monday 15Feb2021, and that same day she got so sick, it was horrible. Patient had chills, fever, aches and pains, and if someone named it, it was there. She stated that before Monday she was 183 pounds, didn&#39;t know if it has changed as she has not been on a scale, but she was sure it has because hasn&#39;t eaten since Monday, as she has had no appetite. Her appointment was at 07:45, and she went right when she got up, so she did not really have anything to eat on Monday. Patient stated that on Tuesday, she did not eat anything until the evening when she had one piece of pizza. Today, patient has only had a yogurt. Today was the first time she has gotten out of bed and even felt like getting dressed and putting her contacts in, since Monday. The last few days, patient stated that after getting up and going to the bathroom she would walk downstairs and felt weak as a kitten (15Jan2021). Patient stated that she was at least 80% better, because she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door (Feb2021), and she was not a wimp, it was just horrible. Patient mentioned that she was on a lot of medicine, probably 10, but this was the first time she was receiving this vaccine. She stated that she was still having pain where the injection occurred (Feb2021), like when her shirt touches it, she can tell it was there. But patient stated that she had the nicest nurse and the injection itself did not hurt, it was just later, and the injection site got swollen (Feb2021). Outcome of the event she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door, chills, fever, aches and pains, felt weak as a kitten was recovering; no appetite was not recovered; while the other events was unknown.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on her left arm on 30Jan2021 to 30Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin sodium (DILANTIN) and carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) and experienced allergy as her reaction to those were sometime between 2010 and 2012. On 30Jan2021 after three and a half hours, the patient felt sensation at her foot for that she could not walk, experienced chills, hands were shaking, had a swollen ankle and foot and pain. Around 5 o clock, the patient stated that it was like a strange sensation in her foot and she also got chills. By 7 o clock, she was in pain. The patient stated that she took two Tylenol. The patient stated that at around 9 o clock, she noticed that her ankle and foot were swollen with red blotches on it so she took two Benadryl and then slept until noon. The patient stated that Benadryl actually gave her some relief, although the pain didn&#39;t completely subside, but it subsided a little so that it was more tolerable. The patient stated that she had been debating if she should have gone to the emergency room (ER), but she didn&#39;t because she has a high pain tolerance. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She started crying and hyperventilating. I used an EpiPen on her immediately within 2 minutes of her turning red and she seemed to calm down for a few minutes. She was able to talk and ask questions. We gave her water to drink but then she started crying again and seemed to have more anxiety. Paramedics came within 15 minutes and took over.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine.

She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine.

An 83-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number EL9262, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 20Jan2021, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing allergies (She normally gets an allergy shot for mold and stuff. She had one 8 days prior to getting the vaccine. She has not gotten one since. She is due but she cannot get it until this clears up. She is unsure of the name of the allergy shot that she gets. She had all the allergy tests years ago and has been going for the last 4 years or so. For things like mold, dust, cockroaches, grass, and trees) for which receiving allergy shot, ongoing High blood pressure, ongoing Reflux, and ongoing Osteoporosis/osteopenia. Osteoporosis runs in her family, she does not have it yet but she had Osteopenia (She started young). Concomitant medications included Allergy shot (unspecified) for about 4 years for allergies, valsartan (Started about 5 or 6 years ago) orally at 160 mg, twice a day for high blood pressure, amlodipine (Started about 5 or 6 years ago), orally at 2.5 mg, once a day for High blood pressure, lansoprazole (PREVACID) (Started about 15-20 years ago) orally at 15 mg once a day for Reflux and ibandronate sodium (started about 10 years ago) via an unknown route, at 150 mg once a month for Osteoporosis/osteopenia; all were ongoing. Patient had the first shot of the vaccine last Tuesday. She stayed for half an hour and was fine. She left there and 10 minutes later while driving she started getting itchy around her face mask. She thought it was the mask irritating her skin. As the day progressed her cheeks and under her chin were getting red and itchy. She took Benadryl and the next day it got worse. She called the doctor and they put her on 20mg Prednisone two times a day. That was a week ago Tuesday. She called her allergist and he thought it was the poly glycol peg that is in the vaccine. He will test her after it is all out of her system. Both her regular doctor and her allergist told her not to take the second shot because it was too close a situation. She did not have an anaphylactic reaction, but if she had not jumped on it right away what could have happened. She is wondering if company has any data on the efficacy of the first shot if going on Prednisone right after? She started the Prednisone the next night. She is tapering off now. She still has a little bit of heat on her face and itching under the skin. So, apparently, she had an allergy to the vaccine and was told not to get the second shot. Patient clarified that she did not get the vaccine last Tuesday. She got the vaccine last Wednesday which was 20Jan2021. She said the reaction started about 40-45 minutes after receiving the dose. She has improved about 90% since starting the Prednisone. This morning her face is a little red. She is currently weaning off the Prednisone. Her face was red and it feels a little hot. She is down to 10mg twice a day. She had started the Prednisone the next day on 21Jan2021. She started the wean yesterday. This morning her face is a littler red on her cheeks. The vaccine seems to be taking a long time to get out of her system. NDC, lot, exp are unknown for the Prednisone as it is in a pharmacy vial. Her doctor told her to stop taking Benadryl as it does not stay in the system long enough. She says the Benadryl is not in a bottle, it is in a stupid little package. LOT: SMF001. EXP: May2022. Her doctor put her on Zyrtec twice a day instead. She started that on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.

She then added that after she got her first shot, she noticed once in a while she couldn&#39;t taste anything but that wasn&#39;t all the time. But now, since she got the second shot, it seemed like all day yesterday, 30Jan2021, and this morning also, that she just can&#39;t taste anything. Then she stated &#34;So, my problem is, would that be a result of the shot?&#34; She stated she was feeling a little bit better today other than that, her mouth - she can&#39;t taste anything. Also, yesterday, she took an extra strength Tylenol every 4 hours to try to help with the pain in her arm on Jan2021; but she has not taken any today. She was just trying to help her arm feel better.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

                                                fainted; passed out and was unconscious; still kind of feel weak; bruise on both knees; fall; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable registered nurse (patient, Retired RN). An 85-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at single dose via an unknown route injection in left arm on 23Jan2021 around 08:15 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high which was controlled with medication, allergic to penicillin and acetylsalicylic acid;ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN).  She had lost weight and shrunk according to when she went to the doctor 2 months ago. No other products were taken. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect; no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine, no events following prior vaccinations. No family medical history relevant to the events. Patient passed out on her way home on 23Jan2021 (unknown time). The event required a visit to Emergency room, but not a Physician office. The event clinical course was as follows: She got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. Patient reported that after being monitored at the vaccination site for 20minutes, she left to go catch the bus and fainted before boarding the bus.  She remembered getting on the bus, but did not remember crossing the street. She passed out and was unconscious. An ambulance was called and they took her back to the hospital where she got the vaccine. She was taken by ambulance back to the ER, stayed for half the day, she received IV fluids, and a brain scan due to her fall. She stated that she still feels kind of weak as of 29Jan2021.  She did not know what time it happened, because she lost her sense of time on that day because she did not remember. When she got to the hospital she woke up and wondered where she was because she did not remember what happened. They got an x-ray of her head to see if she had bumped it, but it was negative. She did have a bruise on both knees. They gave her IV fluids, and kept her there for a little while, then sent her home. She called her doctor the next day, but he was busy, so she talked to the nurse. No treatment was recommended, just said to get a lot of rest. She was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 13Feb2021 and was scared to death. Patient verified that she was not admitted to the hospital. Investigation assessment were performed. They hooked her up to the monitor, did an x-ray and a CT scan while at the hospital on 23Jan2021 which were normal (both fine), and gave her IV fluids. Outcome of fainted, fall, passed out and was unconscious was resolved on 23Jan2021. Outcome of kind of feel weak was not resolved. Outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainted and unconscious cannot be fully excluded.  The underlying history of high blood pressure for this 85 years old patient  might provide an alternative explanation.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 87-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was none.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated she had this injection 08Jan2021, states the following Thursday, 14Jan2021, she broke out with 2 different reactions, a rash that looks like measles all over, the second reaction is part on her back looks like a little kid has not had their diaper changed, like diaper rash, like half a belt from the right side to the back. States she is very concerned, the patient went to a dermatologist who she had a lot of faith in, doctor met her at the door, read about it but has never seen a reaction like this. States that they injected her with something and it worked in two different places. States she did a biopsy on her hip and took movies to show her students, called her and stated she need to report this event. The patient states she wants to know if she should get the second vaccine. States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine. The patient last night to report but she could not get through. Stated she got injection on right arm. The patient stated the rashes are trying to improve. States the rash that looks like measles started on the right side and now is all over. The patient stated she is allergic to bromines and swims in a bromine salt water heated swimming pool and this has nothing to do with it but the point she is saying is that she says your allergic to things and then not have reactions and sometimes you do. Both events were serious with criteria of medially signicant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included biopsy: unknown results, body height: 5 foot 2 inches (States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine).  The outcome of the event rash that looks like measles was not recovered, while the outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.

Taken to ED and evaluated for acute stroke, TPA given. CT was not definitive. Weakness was R&gt;L. Pt confusion worsened a bit into evening of day of event, but by the following morning pt had returned to baseline. Is an independent 89 yo who otherwise lives at home alone and is highly functioning.  Pt did have a recent kyphoploasty and SI joint injection (perhaps with steroids/lidocaine).  Currently patient hospitalized, expected discharge soon, only complaint is tingling in fingers.... we believe this may have been coincidental, but due to time course are reporting here.

An 89-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 13Jan2021 10:35 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Ongoing medical history heart failure, kidney failure, scoliosis and strained hernia (causing pain down her right leg). Other medical history includes patient gave up her car and as a result she went from 5ft 4 inches to 5ft 1 inch and went from 150 pounds to 106 pounds (stated she loves this new weight. She looks fabulous and wonderful in clothes). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient was a retired school teacher, called about the shot, the vaccine, clarified as the COVID Vaccine. She mentioned she has a history of heart failure, kidney failure, scoliosis, and hernias. She was concerned about getting the vaccine and did not think she should get it, but her doctor informed her she should get it so she did. Since getting it she is having a hard time. Stated it feels like lead. She contacted her doctor and was informed to wait it out 24 hours and it would be a lot better. It was reported that the patient got the COVID Vaccine shot yesterday (13Jan2021 10:35). She mentioned her arm is hurting so bad. She contacted her doctor&#39;s office and was informed to give it another 24 hours for the pain to go away. It was reported that the patient hurts so bad, she hurts all over. She added she guesses the arm where she got the injection in is like equalizing the pain she has. She stated as soon as she got the injection everything was wonderful. It was afterwards she felt like she could not move her arm, her left arm. She felt like at first she was having a stroke. She did some self testing and was happy she realized she was not having a stroke. It was reported that the patient provided conflicting details of when arm hurting started. She initially stated it started 13Jan2021. She then stated she did not feel it until 8am in the morning of 14Jan2021 (pending clarification) when she could not move her arm and thought she was having a stroke. She commented she sleeps every 2 hours. She would later mention in report she felt the arm pain starting yesterday (as reported). Attempts made to clarify start of arm hurting, but unable to clarify further. She is scheduled to get the second does on 03Feb2021. She commented even with her age she is still very useful. She was told to continue taking acetaminophen. She has the 1000 mg, take two pills every six hours. She was told if she continued to have pain to take Aleve. Treatment was given for the events. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient received second vaccine dose and felt well without significant symptoms in the days following.  Then, on 2/19 she developed epistaxis, brusining, and petechiae.   She had labs drawn by a local provider and platelet count was 7.   (baseline, even on chemotherapy for her AML is in the normal range).   Therefore, she reported to a local health center and a recheck of the platelet count was &lt;3k.     WBC and Hb were within normal range.   No circulating blasts or other evidence of AML.  No recent infections or other exposures.   That center reached out for transfer to our hospital as we initially diagnosed and treated her AML.  I advised dexamethasone 40mg and transfer (they also transfused 5u platelets prior to her departure)  Upon arrival at our center about 12hrs later, platelet count was 210 and on 2 rechecks it has remained in the normal range while continuing dexamethasone 40mg daily.   Bleeding symptoms ceased and she was discharged in stable condition.  She plans to return back to home after discharge with repeat lab testing later this week after stopping steroids.   Chemotherapy to be held at least one extra week to ensure stability.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 89-years-old female patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (by injection once to left arm) on 22Jan2021 COVID-19 immunization since patient was in an independent facility with 238 residents. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. She said she got her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on a Friday. She said she had no pain in her arm after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, but then on 26Jan2021 she noticed about 8 hives right at her waist line. She asked if the hives were a reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her skin was red and puffy in 8 different places on her waistline. She said her skin on her waistline looks like what happens when being allergic to something. She said she lives in an independent living community, and the COVID-19 Vaccine was provided to the residents in a group setting. She said no COVID-19 Vaccine immunization cards were provided at the time of vaccination. Patient reported &#34;you know when the person gets hives, you get blisters, red blisters and now they are getting worse&#34; and asked if that was a side effect from the vaccine.&#34; She was fine for a couple days, then noticed, and she doesn&#39;t know if this is a side effect or not, the waistline, she has about 5, states &#34;you know when a person gets hives in the skin, it is raised and red? Is that a side effect?&#34; States she shrunk (onset date not reported). There was a doctor there she would see her week and would show her, she will be giving her a physical. Patient would try to get physical therapy there. She further stated it looks like hives, she was looking now, she has 8 hives, they were the same color, and it was also itchy. She was not given a vaccine card. She was brought into a dining room, one area aside, there was a nurse, and applications already filled out, she has no idea what her number was, but after the injection she was put in another room, and sat for 15 minutes, to make sure no reaction, and there wasn&#39;t, she had no pain in arm, she felt well, but this showed up. She has to go back in 3 weeks for second injection. No investigation assessment was performed. The outcome of shrunk was unknown and not recovered (ongoing) for the other events. Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.
