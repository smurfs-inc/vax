She presented to the emergency department yesterday and was treated with Solumedrol, Pepcid and Benadryl which relieved her symptoms.  She was discharged home with Pepcid Benadryl and prednisone however she has not taken the prednisone because she does not like how it makes her feel.  She states this morning she developed tightness in her throat, nausea and felt as if she were going to pass out.  She states when her symptoms began she took Pepcid and Benadryl but did not take any prednisone.

Over night contracted a fever, by the time I was able to get up to measure it (around 3:45 AM) it was 99.5 degrees, and broke by 5 AM. Had fever dreams prior to waking around 3 AM, and had chills for the remainder of the night. Felt  achy and a little unsteady for the rest of the day but was fully recovered by 12/31

                                                On 12/24 at around 10 PM, circulation to my 4th left digit significantly decreased after being outside of my car for around 15 minutes during a temperature of about 50 degrees. I realized when sharp pain was felt at the digit. After about 5 minutes the digit felt numb. I got in my car, turned on the heater, and massaged my finger. Sharp pain was felt again as circulation returned to the digit. The event last approximately 10 minutes from the moment I realized the finger was pale until color returned.   This occurred again on 12/27 at around 2 PM as I walked from my car into a store at a temperature of about 40 degrees. This time, discoloration occurred bilaterally on my left 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits and my right 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits.  The event lasted more than 15 minutes with constant massaging.   This has occurred two more times since then, both times occurring bilaterally with minimal exposure to cold.

                                                Had me wait for 15 minutes after vaccine and started having a redness in neck and was really itchy; whole body big time itchy. My chest - shortness of breath. Gave me a shot of benydryl  - 25 mg in my right arm and I went home and itching still didn&#39;t go away and I took pill of benydryl. Chills next day; super cold; headache; tired - and I couldn&#39;t think straight. Nothing was registering in my head with training at work - felt slow. Went home from took more benydryl. Next morning - pins and needles in back of my head. Went to urgent care (Riverside Urgent Care) and they gave me gave me Vexamethasone - shot it up in my butt and every symptom went away after that shot and I was okay after that.Itching went away after that. Felt weak for about a week afterwards. Went and had second shot yesterday 1/10/2021. They gave me medication with vaccine so I wouldn&#39;t get reaction this time. Gave me liquid 25 benydryl beforehand and had me wait 15 mintues and after 15 min they gave me the second dose of vaccine after the injection and they had me wait for 30 minutes. Right away I started getting itchy and they gave me pill form( 2 pills) of Vexamethsone and itching slowly stopped and they sent me home after an hour. Itching slowly went away - later that day. And today I&#39;m okay.

                                                I got my vaccine at 5:15pm on 1/14/2021. At 5:20pm on 1/14/2021 my heart started racing. My heart rate went up to 124 beats per minute. I was having flushing, tingling through my whole body. My blood pressure went up to 139/96. I was having itching and blotchiness on my chest, neck, left arm and thighs.This lasted for 3 hours with my heart rate going up and down. I was sent to the ER by the nurses who gave my vaccine. There they gave me Benadryl. 2 tablets of 25mg each. This helped and I was sent home.

                                                Patient developed angioedema of her eyelids after COVID-19 vaccination.  She received her Covid vaccine on 1/10/2021 at 11:30 AM.  She received the Pfizer vaccine.  She works at a nursing home.  She had some fatigue and tiredness during the day but woke up on the second day without any symptoms.  On 1/30/2021, she developed bilateral eyelid swelling.  The swelling is mild to moderate intensity involving the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally with a prickly burning sensation associated with pruritus.  The reaction lasted less than a day and resolved without any skin desquamation, scarring or bruising.  She denies any hives anywhere else.  She does not have a large local reaction at the injection site.  She denies respiratory complaints, GI symptoms, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, wheezing, swelling of her throat or other symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis.  She used Benadryl with significant improvement.   She had a significant reaction after influenza vaccination consisting of swelling of her face and her eyelids with development of dry patches bilaterally within 2 days, resolving with skin desquamation.  The reaction lasted for 1 week.  She received her influenza vaccination in October 20, 2020.   She was seen in our office in 2012 for bilateral eyelid angioedema with associated urticaria shortly after swimming in the pool.

Then came the shortness of breath and the feeling of pins and needles which also brought itching and some minor hives with it. The dizziness, nausea, and feeling of fainting went away after about 10 minutes and I had to go to the Emergency Department to take care of the shortness of breath and hive like reaction. I was given some medications and they diagnosed it as a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine. I was completely fine with the first one.

                                                Within 24 hours of getting my 2nd COVID vaccine, I began to feel weak and achy. My neck and face got really hot while the rest of my body stayed cold. A small headache began to turn into a migraine. During the night, my body began to hurt beyond achy causing me to toss and turn. When I woke up in the morning, I couldn&#39;t stand even the littlest of pressure placed on my body. For example, my cat jumped on my leg and it felt like someone wacked me with a baseball bat because of how sensitive my body was. The only treatment used for myself during this time was Tylenol. It helped with the head aches. Overall, it took me about three nights to actually feel ok again.

A 26-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Other medical history and known allergies were reported as none. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the report and vaccination. Concomitant medications included zinc, ascorbic acid (VIT C), ergocalciferol (VIT D) and an unspecified birth control medication. The first dose of BNT162B2 (brand: Pfizer as reported) was received on 06Jan2021 12:00 PM in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient had no other vaccine in the four weeks prior to second dose vaccination. On 27Jan2021 23:00, the patient experienced nose bleed, fever of 102, severe injection site swelling (grapefruit size), lethargy, tachycardia, shortness of breath, severe joint pain, migraine and muscle pain. The patient did not receive treatments for the reported adverse events. Patient had COVID test post vaccination specified as nasal swab on 27Jan2021 with test result as negative. The events were reported as recovered with lasting effects.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the close drug-event temporal association and the location,  the reasonable possibility that the reported severe injection site swelling is related to BNT162B2 seems likely.

I had high blood pressure 180/120, facial puffiness and mild bottom lip swelling. I developed an onset of increased mucus in my throat causing me to clear my throat frequently. RN on site reported no throat swelling, but increased thickness due to mucus. I received a Benadryl injection on site within 30 minutes and almost immediately symptoms began to lessen. The next day I had mild bottom lip swelling, body itchiness, chest rash, headache and fatigue. Today (24 hours after vaccine) I have a headache, fatigue and body itchiness.

Two days later I had an area of papules on my anterior thigh the size of a half dollar. The right sided back pain then began to radiate around to my hip and the rash began to be painful. My right thigh eventually began to tingle and and the pain increased in severity. On Jan 7th I presented to the acute care clinic at the Clinic and was diagnosed with shingles.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I began having chills and vomited. My fatigue became more severe as well. Later that evening my fatigue persisted and I noticed a rapid heart rate via my Watch. My resting heart rate which usually is about 80 BPM was at 100 while laying down and not engaged in any physical activity. When I stood I was dizzy and had poor balance. While my entire arm no longer hurt, the injection site showed a bump as well. When I awoke the next day my heart rate appeared normal again, and I wasn&#39;t especially fatigued compared to before I got the vaccine. I did experience another minor gastro-intestinal episode later that afternoon, but otherwise my symptoms appeared to have passed aside from the fatigue. By the end of my work day I was very tired again, although it is uncertain if this is due to the vaccine or from my continued recovery from Covid and adjusting to the physical demands of going back to my job in-person. Because I received my vaccine on the same day as my first day back to work, I have no experience working post-covid before having the vaccine to compare my current state of fatigue to. On the evening of 01/07 I noted that fatigue was slightly less pronounced. I do not currently have a primary care doctor but will be calling to try to gain an appointment so that my second dose can be monitored.

                                                Hives; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 27-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021, NDC number: 5926710001), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 08:11 at a single dose in right bicep (right arm) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included urinary tract infection from 21Dec2020 to Dec2020 which was resolved and fine after the antibiotic, ongoing eczema (had this condition basically her entire life), ongoing sensitive skin (always had pretty sensitive skin). Concomitant medication not reported. The patient previously took nitrofurantoin (MACROBID [NITROFURANTOIN]) from 24Dec2020 to 28Dec2020. The patient experienced hives on 01Jan2021 09:00 (also reported as &#34;got it last Wednesday morning and broke out in hives the next day&#34;). Patient stated, &#34;I have a question to you. I got the Covid Vaccine, the Pfizer Vaccine on Wednesday morning like around 8 o&#39; clock and this morning I woke up and I broke out hives. I didn&#39;t know if in two days, I just want to report my symptoms just to make sure everything is okay.&#34; The hives were bad on Friday and took Benadryl and Cortisone cream and it is better now. The hives are not worse; not as bad as it was on the first day. She took about 5 Benadryl throughout the first day: 01Jan2021. Over the last few days she has continued to get small breakouts of hives on pretty much every single spot on her body except for her face; the hives seem to kind of take turns in different areas of the body but have not gone away. She has used Hydrocortisone, lotion and Benadryl for the hives. The outcome of the event was recovering. She is both a sonogram technologist as well as the patient. She asked if she should or should not receive the second dose of Pfizer COVID- 19 Vaccine in response to the hives. She is supposed to get second dose on 19Jan2021; unknown if she will or will not change dose scheduling in response to event at this time.

                                                Fine for ~6-9 hours post injection. But then immediate fever (103F), body ache, extreme joint pain and a feeling of something eating away in my bones, chills, bruised/swollen/pain in left arm (injection spot), fever, fatigue, headache, light cough for 5 straight days. Not able to do normal activities. Took Tylenol and ice pack to alleviate fever. The day after injection, body fell so weak that my body acquired another viral infection (very unusual). No shortness of breath. Eating/drinking/appetite fine. No loss of taste/smell.  I am exactly 1 week from the injection. No fever, just light headache. Able to resume normal activities but gets fatigued fairly quickly (after 3 hours). I am very active and work out 2 hours every day, but may not be able to do strenuous activity/exercise for some time...  I was symptomatic covid last year in April 2019. This was very similar experience but an extremely debilitating, more intense version of the covid that I had.  ***I am unsure if I should proceed with the second dose due to a very severe reaction to the first dose***

Twelve hours later, after waking up those same symptoms were only on the right side of my body. Friday morning, mostly normal physically just with some overall fatigue. Friday afternoon I started to get hives on my chest and overnight into Saturday they were on my lower back, sides, and legs. I took 50 mg of Benadryl every 6-12 hours until Monday mid-day when Benadryl was not helping reduce the hives and so I had full body hives. I did try an drugstore cortisone cream which did not help.  Sought treatment at an urgent care as I was feeling anxious and could not control the itching. I and was diagnosed with likely allergic reaction to the covid-19 vaccine.

Thursday I just felt red, itchy, swollen L arm due to vaccination site. Friday morning my bottom lip was severely swollen with numbness and tingling. It went down by the next day and after taking Benadryl. I have not had an allergic reaction to anything in my life before. Was instructed to not get second vaccine as I may have a more increased reaction to it.

When she injected the 2nd dose, the bump was painful and grew twice in size on my arm and started bleeding. The technician rubbed the area for a fews minutes and the swelling went down. The bump went down, but the whole day, I felt a little sick. At around 7pm, I felt feverish, with muscle aches and chills. My skin was sensitive to touch, I felt nauseous, and I could barely walk. The bottom of my left eyelid also became a little swollen. The symptoms resolved the next morning.

                                                Fifteen minutes following injection, the left arm broke out in hives and had numbness and tingling. Then I became dizzy and pale. I was laid down and vital signs were taken. My heart rate was in the 110s and 120s and stayed elevated for about four hours. The hives resolved and did not spread to the bilateral arm or anywhere else. The following two days I felt incredibly weak and had urinary frequency. I was told to go to the hospital by the health clinic staff but I declined.

                                                First started off with a cold feeling around injection site. Around 11:30 at night I felt muscle aches in my calves. 30 minutes later my legs were having severe muscle aches and joint pain in my ankles. I was having cold chills and aches the whole night along with sweating. On 1/20/2021 (the next day) the muscle aches, chills, and joint pain continued through the whole day. I was nauseous at times and did not have an appetite. Around 5 o clock I felt some relief with my leg pain but it started again around 9 o clock. I continued switching Tylenol extra strength and ibuprofen. I went to bed on 1/20 at midnight with little leg pain but major neck and back aches. I did not have cold chills through the night or sweating. Today (1/21/2021) leg pain is near gone, but joint pain is still there in my left ankle and knee. My legs feel heavy and strange and is causing me to walk slowly because I feel like my legs are very fatigued and off balance. I have had neck and back aches all day. I have not had chills today

                                                I was asymptomatic for about 6.5 hours after the vaccine was given. At about 6pm on the day I received the vaccine I noticed some injection site tenderness, minimal swelling; has been present since. Symptoms are very mild. I started having chills and hot flashes intermittently, more hot flashes than chills, have been present since 6pm yesterday. About 9pm I had a headache, muscle aches, joint pain as well. I felt feverish but temperature was 98.6F. I also noticed some axial lymph node swelling as well on the Left side where I received the vaccine. Tender to touch, not too painful though. Since received the vaccine I have had intermittent dizzy spells as well all throughout the day.  I decided to go to sleep at 10:30pm and all night I tossed and turned with a headache and hot flashes. I woke up at 7:30am and was so stiff I could barely get out of bed. I called into work as I could not stand up without have dizziness. All day so far I have had dizziness upon standing, headache, myalgia, arthralgias, hot flashes/felt feverish, swollen axial lymph nodes and all I have wanted to do today is sleep. I took a nap and when I woke up I had been sleeping for 6 hours. I finally was able to get up and drink a 32ounce cup of water and take some ibuprofen. Ate some cereal. I still have a headache and dizziness upon standing that limit my ability to do normal daily functions.

                                                I received my vaccine yesterday. I waited at the location for 15 minutes with no issues. After about 20 minutes, I developed a burning sensation at the injection site.  Approximately 30 minutes following the vaccine, I began experiencing an intense itching and hives of my opposite forearm. Then shortly after, my shins and front of ankles started itching. I began getting little bumps with an itch to several other areas of my body, also including redness and itchiness of one side of my face. At about 40 minutes, I also experienced a cold sensation felt at the injection site, almost like what it feels like after removing an ice cube from the skin.           The itching of my skin on several areas of my body persisted for about an hour and a half. The welts and itchiness almost completely subsided at about the 2 hour mark. I did take two benedryls once I got home which was about an hour and a half after the injection.  Today, the following day after injection, the bumps and itchiness are still no longer present. I have been experiencing a very sore arm at injection site and extreme exhaustion today though.

                                                I started breaking out in hives/rash on January 27th at church. I was itching all over. I took a benadryl to help. Since then I have continued to break out in spurts. The site will start itching on my body and not stop until I itch it, then it goes away and pops up somewhere else. I have not changed laundry detergent, eating habits or environments. The only thing new to me would be the vaccine. with it being almost 8 days onset from vaccine, I didn&#39;t think that would be the problem. I can&#39;t figure it out though. I spoke with Doctor this morning and she said it was best to report because it could be an adverse reaction.

Majority of the spots appears within the bra line of the patient, started about a week and a half after the first done (1/22/21) but became increasingly worse two days after the second dose (was received on 2/12/21).  First there were many more on the trunk with some patches increasing in size and rash starting to appear on arms and legs as well. Tried benadryl, fexofenadine, and hydrocortisone which helped minorly. Sought medical advice in the clinic (5 days post second dose) and couldn&#39;t identify other source of rash (no new product, no bugs bites, etc). Was prescribed triamcinilone acetate cream to help relive itching and redness, which as of 2/24/2021 is improving slowly.

                                                I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 9:15 am on 2/23/21. Initially, my only symptoms were injection site soreness and minor swelling. Gradually throughout the day, my entire left arm become more and more sore. By 5:00pm, I felt exhausted and dizzy and was having chills. My temperature was 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. I took a dose of Extra Strength Tylenol, but felt no change. My joints and muscles began to ache around 6:00pm on 2/23/21 and did not stop aching until around 9:00pm on 2/24/21. During the evening of 2/23/21, my dizziness increased and I felt as if I would pass out any time I sat up or stood. My temperature had returned to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit by 10:00pm on 2/23/21. I then took a dose of Motrin to help with my soreness. On 2/24/21 from morning until 8:30pm, I had no fever or chills, but still felt exhausted and had minor muscle/joint achiness. I took 3 doses of Motrin on 2/24/21 to help with the soreness. Throughout the day, I had some difficulty breathing (felt like a mild asthma attack) and used my emergency inhaler once. At 8:30pm on 2/24/21, my temperature was 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. I took another dose of Motrin and went to sleep. Around 3:00am on 2/25/21, I woke up drenched in sweat, but feeling better. My temperature was normal then. When I woke up at 7:00am on 2/25/21, I no longer felt achy, dizzy, or tired. I still feel (now at 1:30pm on 2/25/21)as though my asthma is aggravated, but am not having difficulty breathing.

A 27-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 27-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Bell&#39;s Palsy (motor nerves involved) from 2017 to 2017. Concomitant medications included unspecified birth control. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced Bell&#39;s Palsy, severe muscle pain, itching in the left arm, rash in the left arm, cold sensation, like it was freezing, and severe allergic reaction on an unspecified date. It was reported that the Bell&#39;s Palsy lasted 8 days and was considered a modified Bell&#39;s Palsy because it only sensorial nerves were involved. It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment for Bell&#39;s Palsy. The clinical outcome of Bell&#39;s Palsy, severe muscle pain, itching in the left arm, rash in the left arm, cold sensation, like it was freezing, and severe allergic reaction was recovered on an unspecified date.

These symptoms lasted for about two weeks. I took Benadryl to help with the symptoms - it helped  the symptoms to let me to sleep. A week and a half before I took the second COVID vaccine, I had a TB test done. Exhaustion is still there and I still have nausea. Dizziness has been gone since second week of the 2nd dose of vaccine. Swelling on the injection site is gone. I had a doctor visit - Video visit with clinic and the dr recommended bedrest - February 11th or 12th - no meds given.  I&#39;m due Sept 26, 2021. This is my fourth pregnancy - I had my daughter who is eight years old; an abortion; had my son who is five and he was born pre-term due to lack of fluids in the stomach - 4 lbs 5 oz. and now this pregnancy.

Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

The muscle aches lasted about 24 hours. The injection site was my left arm and I now have swelling in my left axilla which started the evening of 1/6/21 and is still currently swollen. I am an ultrasound technologist and was able to scan myself this morning when I came back to work. It appears I have a cluster of reactive lymph nodes in the area of swelling within my left axilla, the largest measuring 3.0 cm. It is very tender in the area of swelling and the pain radiates down my left arm. I had a lot of pain at the injection site that lasted for about 24 hours, it is now subsiding. However, for the last 24 hours it has been very painful to bend my arm. Any time I tried to bend my arm it sent a throbbing pain down to my left hand, it is still occurring today.

I treated the nausea with Zofran with some improvement in nausea, but other symptoms continued. My max temperature (without antipyretic affecting) was 100.7 F with continued nausea, body aches, fatigue and headache until the 24 hour after vaccine time frame. After 24 hours, nausea had improved largely to just mild, mild headache continued and fatigue/body aches. Around 28 hours, temp was 100.2 F (outside of last antipyretic dose) with same symptoms. Now around 30 hours out with recent Motrin taken, my nausea is still mild, low appetite, improved body aches and less fatigue.

                                                I noticed on January 12 that my left arm where I received the shot my bones were aching and my joints (my shoulder, my elbow, my forearm bones, and all my hand joints) were aching and my hand was slightly swollen. My coworker reported aching joints two days after she received the vaccine. So I?m not sure if my aching joints are related to the vaccine but I?m suspicious they are.

I took my temperature twice in the absence of antipyretics and did not have a fever (98.7 and 98.2) but my skin felt hot and painful as it does when I have had a fever in the past. By about 5:00 or around 24 hours post vaccination, all symptoms resolved aside from fatigue and headache, but the headache was less than it was before. I experienced those symptoms for the rest of the evening and woke up this morning feeling completely normal.

                                                About 27 hours after my vaccine (at about 9 pm on 01/12) I began having 8-10/10 chest pain. Mostly burning sharp pain, but some restricting tight pain as well, radiating to my back mostly. It would be relieved for maybe 10 minutes at a time but then flare back up for about 5 hours. I went to the emergency room, where they did a cardiac work up including blood work and EKG, vitals and a chest X-ray, all which were unremarkable. At about 0200 am on 01/13, the pain subsided. Previous to the chest pain, during the morning and afternoon of 01/12, I had a low grade fever (99.9 F), an intense headache, and fatigue. 01/14/21 sore swollen lymph node under L arm.

Since that time, the rash has spread to my back, abdomen, chest, neck, ears. It appears to be urticaria and is extremely itchy. I completed a steroid taper early on and the rash is no loner affecting my face. I am taking daily antihistamines and using hydrocortisone cream for the itching. The rash continues to spread and is made worse with scratching.  I am unsure if this is related to the vaccine, but this has never happened before and I have no known allergies. I got the second vaccine on 1/8/2021 (at the time the rash was improving and I thought it to be poison ivy).

The following day I had mild hives on my neck and thigh creases, I attributed it from sweating, hives went away after taking Claritin. The evening of 1/11/2021 I had 1 glass of wine and subsequently broke out into hives all over my chest and neck, took Benadryl that night. In the morning of 1/12/2021 the hives had worsened. I started Prednisone 40mg, Claritin, Pepcid 20mg in the AM and Prednisone 20mg, Benadryl, Pepcid 20mg at night. The following day the hives had mostly resolved and I only took the OTC medications. In the afternoon of 1/13/2021 I rode my stationary bike. After the ride I had broke into hives again on my chest and neck and where my headband sat. I then took Prednisone 40mg, Benadryl 25mg, Pepcid 20mg. Hives have mostly resolved today 1/14/2021, still have the sensation of itchiness. Never had throat closing or shortness of breath.

                                                localized pain at the injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK5730, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose to prevent COVID-19. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, 08Jan2021 (lot number: EK9231, expiration date: Apr2021). She didn&#39;t have a fever or chills, but she had localized pain which she also had with the first dose. She still has pain in her armpit, to the touch and when she moves it, but there is no swelling, lumps or bumps. The pain has decreased; it&#39;s not as bad as it was when she first noticed it. The localized pain at the injection site was worse with the first injection in Dec2020; she just did not have the underarm pain and she didn&#39;t have any pain until the day after she got the first dose. She got the 2nd dose at 5:30pm, and had pain at around 8pm or 9pm that night. The following day was the height of the pain for the second dose, and it has been decreasing since then. She got both doses in her left arm. Outcome of the event was unknown.

It was not one of the possible reaction from covid vaccine but rather administrator error in injecting the vaccine.  The symptoms appeared about 3 hours after receiving the vaccine,  now have numbness, tingling, pain and burning sensation on my left pam in the arm of given vaccine.   Obviously, the person giving the vaccine, hit the nerve.

I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

A 28-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK4176, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis from 2009 and exposure to a positive COVID patient on 08Jan2021. The patient also had a sinus drainage down the back of her throat. It went away but started back up on 09Jan2021. It is the same since last night but had improved from over the weekend. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EH9899, expiry date not reported) on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had her second COVID19 Vaccine dose last Saturday and reported having a &#34;weird reaction&#34;. She had already gone to urgent care and was told to call. She experienced rash from Monday evening in the knees and elbows which spread to face and joint areas (knees, ankles, toe, hip, wrist), which occurred as splotches of red; some were raised bumps with symptoms relieved with Benadryl. Patient said that she was not sure if she was having a reaction or not to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She was just in urgent care that morning and was going to primary care that afternoon. Urgent care thought she was having a reaction. She got her second dose of the vaccine on Saturday morning, 09Jan2021. That night she had the typical immune response.  She had chills, sore muscles, sore throat, fatigue, and facial pain from sinus pressure, which lasted through Sunday. She took Sudafed PE and Monday when she woke up, she felt normal. She experienced rash from Monday evening in the knees and elbows which spread to face and joint areas (knees, ankles, toe, hip, wrist, fingers, feet, face, upper arms), rash which occurred as splotches of red; some were raised bumps with symptoms relieved with Benadryl. Benadryl helped it get better, but after it wears off the rash comes back and it gets worse. It had spread to different areas. Sometimes, it will be really bad on her knees, then other times really bad on her elbows or hips. Her hips were bad last night. Now it is on the bottom of her feet and on her knees again. She asked if these were something that have been previously reported. All of these symptoms, besides the rash, she felt like she had the flu. It knocked her on her ass it was pretty terrible. But it went away and she felt better. It was a typical immune response so she would say it was not serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 13Jan2021. Clinical outcome of events chills, sore muscles, sore throat, fatigue, and facial pain from sinus pressure was recovered on 11Jan2021, while for the other events was not recovered.

                                                I received the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on December 17th at 0640. I first started noticing some discoloration on the right side of my neck in a patch on January 1st. Over the course of the next 3 days the area became more red, dry, raised (but still maculopapular), and spread from the right side of my neck around the back of my neck to the left side and then the front. The area was mildly itchy. I had not had any new exposures including no new shampoos, soaps, clothes, sprays, sheets, detergent, etc. I have never had a rash that looked like this, nor have I ever had a rash on my neck. At it&#39;s fullest, the rash was a large patch of red, dry skin on my right with small maculopapular circles scattered on the rest of my neck. Around January 6-7th, when I got the second dose, the rash began to spread down my sides. That area was more itchy than my neck. The rash appearance was very consistent, as was the distribution with what I have seen of pityriasis rosea in my patients where you start with a Herald patch somewhere and then the rash spreads to other parts of the body. In January I had sought out an appointment through a virtual healthcare. they were hesitant to start steroids so as not to interfere with my immune response. I started over the counter hydrocortisone. In the few hours after I put it on the rash would be less itchy, less dry appearing and less red, but still noticeably pink, then would return. The rash has finally completely dissipated as of February 3rd morning, so it was present for a little more than a month.

                                                &#34;the next day [after vaccination] the injection site was extremely sore and the pain went up to my neck and down into my hand. From what I heard this is pretty normal so I had no concerns. Over the next couple days the injection site pain was gone along with the neck pain but the wrist/hand pain persisted. It?s now been a week since the pain started and my wrist/hand/forearm are still really sore/achy. I?ve been icing it multiple times a day but the pain persists. It?s especially bad when typing or doing any repetitive motions with my hand. &#34;

This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improve; brain fog; retroorbital headache/intermittent mild tension type frontal headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).  A 29-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 12:00 at 29 years old at single dose at Left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (Physician Assistant). A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter stated that she is treating a patient in ICU that got the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020. The patient developed hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction 1 hour later. Seriousness of events was reported to be hospitalization. Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter also mentioned that it was not a mild reaction and patient was still in the ICU, 48 hours later.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylactic reaction and hives cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.

Unable to lift my arm very far without pain. Worse than any other injection recieved in the past. Pain throught the night-causing lack of sleep. Severe pain for about 24 hours or so then completely gone. My muscle in my arm then felt tight as if there was inflammation of some sort or an injury to the muscle. Upon lifting my arm it felt as if my arm was pulling back. No pain during this action but more of a weakness. No relief from anti inflammatory medicaiton or ice. Sensation in arm noted to be gone on 01/09/2021.

                                                Soreness at injection site began a few hours after administration. By the evening I began experiencing headache and an overall malaise feeling. This progressed into chills to the point of shivering and feeling feverish. Overnight I developed another headache and felt very mildly nauseous in addition to feeling fever/chills. Overnight I took 3 OTC Advil, was bundled up under multiple blankets, and got lots of rest. The next day I felt much better, only some fatigue.

Became slightly short of breath and felt my heart was racing. Took 25 mg of oral Benadryl and told to go to ED.  In ED heart rate was 126 bpm and BP WAS 136/99. Monitored in the ED for a few hours with no  further interventions. Heart rate improved to 102 bpm and blood pressure to 129/82.

                                                During the first few hours following vaccination, I had soreness at the injection sight and a mild headache. About 10hours later, I started to experience more severe symptoms including a fever of 101-102deg, chills/cold sweats, a moderate headache, and body aches. This continued throughout the night and into the next day. In addition, I began to experience a burning sensation in my chest, similar to heart burn. I have consistently been taking Tylenol and recently took Tums to aide with the heartburn feeling.

                                                I received my second dose of the vaccine at 03:00pm on 1/12/21. I noticed around 06:00pm that I started feeling a little tired and some pain around the injection site. I had anticipated this as I felt similar symptoms from the first dose of the vaccine. I took a nap and woke up around 09:00pm feeling some of the worst body aches I had felt in a long time. My arm that I received my vaccine in was painful and warm to the touch. I felt dehydrated as well so I drank a pedialyte, took OTC Tylenol extra strength, and laid down again. Around 07:00am on 1/13/21, I still felt achy, sweaty, and felt pain in the arm that I recieved the vaccine in. I went into my bathroom, and noticed two small red and raised areas around the injection site. I took pictures of the site, and continued to closely monitor through out the day. I ended up calling in sick to work on 1/13/21. It is now around 12:00pm on 1/14/21, and I woke up with a pounding headache, muscle aches, dehydration, nausea, and low energy. I feel like I am hungover or have the flu, and am planning on calling in sick to work again. I reported my symptoms to my staffing department at my workplace on 1/13/21 and wanted to file a report here as well.

There is a sensation of warmth and feeling &#34;full&#34; in this area. At this time, no treatment has been taken as it is not uncomfortable. It is 1:45pm, and all symptoms are still present. The warmth sensation has slightly increased throughout the day. I have had bouts of chills throughout the day, but no fever or headache.

They used the 1in needle so I think she got into my tricep but it was nowhere near my deltoid. I have injection site soreness which is why I think she even got to the muscle but I have none of the classic immune reaction symptoms. I wanted it on record in case it was not thoroughly absorbed and then I wouldn&#39;t be covered. I figured with this being so new every mistake matters. I&#39;m going to try and get an antigen test in 2-3 weeks.

Cold sweats, shakes, cold then hot, body aches, fatigue. These happened off and on through the day. When started feeling crappy took temp and it was 99.6-99.8.

Overall feeling of a cold.  I think it?s important to note that I had Covid-19 in the month  of November and received  my first vaccine December 22nd. I had side effects after the first shot but not nearly as bad as this time. I am nurse in a doctors office if that matters at all. I am still feeling under the weather but wanted to get these down before I forgot them.

A 29-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot#: El3248), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 15:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

Fever stayed all day until 2000, no less than 99.0 even with Tylenol and ibuprofen until that time. Also developed body/muscle aches around 1200 on 07Jan2021, and some nausea. Got sent home from work that day. On 08Jan21 patient synced my (brand withheld) and checked my heart rate for day before. Didn&#39;t know it till then, but had heart rate of greater than 100BPM all day on 07Jan2021. Highest it got was 130, my resting heart rate is usually in the 60s. Also on 08Jan2021 no more fever, but whole right arm is in pain and have a swollen lymph node around right clavicle area. Pain with minor touch to clavicle and upper arm (at site of injection). Will be going to visit a doctor to make sure it is just a swollen lymph node since it is now 09Jan08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still swollen and there&#39;s still a lot of pain to R arm. Outcome of event fever was recovered, of others was not recovered.

Extremely uncomfortable, from neck to back to calves, without improvement with Tylenol or ibuprofen, causing me to be unable to sleep. Around hour 20 post-vaccine, I started to get chills. It wasn?t just feeling cold or shivering, it was full body convulsions that lasted approximately 15 minutes.  I became nauseas and dizzy after that for about an hour, unable to stand or walk anywhere. The severe body aches continued, with no improvement from Tylenol or ibuprofen or heating pad. Aches resolved around hour 30 post-vaccine and the only symptom left was pain at the injection site.

On Jan 16, I developed facial edema with continued rash which worsened throughout the day despite Benadryl. On Jan 17, the rash was improving, but the facial and neck edema had worsened to the extent that my eyes were nearly fully closed. I presented to the ED and received treatment for allergic reaction, including Epinephrine, steroids, and histamine blockers. I have no known allergies.

                                                Vaccine administered too high in right arm by CP.  At time of administration pt felt severe burning and pain at and around right shoulder joint.  After vaccine administered there was hardly any R upper arm muscle pain noted. All pain was located in the right shoulder joint 9/10. Pt unable to move or use R arm/shoulder for approximately 3 days post injection. Heat applied several times a day, arm/shoulder rested and ibuprofen 800mg taken every 6 hours. Small range of motion exercises attempted to help alleviate stiffening. Approximately 4 days post injection- very small range of motion returned 25% of baseline- still unable to use right shoulder to complete daily tasks, pain 7/10 in right shoulder joint. Pt continued to use heat, rest and ibuprofen 800mg.   No muscle pain noted in right upper arm. As of 1/19/20- range of motion about 50% in right shoulder, pt has clicking and popping in right shoulder joint with all movement. Pain 5/10 in right shoulder joint with movement. Pt unable to lift object more than approximately 3lbs. Ibuprofen 800mg still taken PRN pain, heat still applied PRN.  All symptoms reported in Vsafe app following injection. 1/19/21 Notified hospital through COVID question hotline- RN charted problem in pts medical record.  Pt concerned because there is not a significant improvement 10 days post injection. Also due to the lack of information about adverse events of the Pfizer COIVD 19 vaccine.

                                                Started breaking out in hives; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 29-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, lot number: EL0142, via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma (had an Inhaler just for whenever it&#39;s bad but she hadn&#39;t taken it in probably over a year), had typhoid once in the past as a child and had an allergy to Sulfa drugs (Unspecified Medication). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she got the Vaccine on 30Dec2020 and a week later that would have been on 06Jan2021, she believed that was the date that evening she started breaking out in hives and she typically had typhoid once in the past as a child because she had an allergy to Sulfa drugs (Unspecified Medication). So she got hives a week later and she got them again three days later both in the evening and both disappeared by the time. She woke up in the morning she didn&#39;t take any antihistamines or anything. The patient wanted to know if that was a reaction other people were having and could provide any advice on second dose. She was supposed to get the second dose on the 21Jan2021. Patient stated it was twice that she had received the vaccine, she broke out with hives and it was not typically normal for her. The patient had lab testing a couple of weeks prior to the report, just took a whole blood drawn to check some of her levels. No treatment was received for the event. The outcome of the event was recovered in Jan2021.

Injection site developed bumps that looked like hives per report and spread the entire arm. The patient took a dose of diphenhdyramine however itching and hives continued into the night and could not sleep, another diphenhdyramine dose was taken and she was able to sleep for a few hours. She went to see her PCP who deemed this an allergic reaction to the vaccine, gave her oral steroid along w topical cream. The bumps and hives subsides within 24 hours of steroid use, and the itching resolved after 2 days of initiating steroid (3 days post vaccine) . Steroids were started 1 day post vaccine.  PCP recommended patient sees an allergist for further investigation and refrain from second dose of vaccine

Then about a week after that vaccine, the redness came back but it was itchy, hot to touch, and hard. Over the next day or so it grew quite large (have pictures for comparison throughout the days). Treatment included oral antibiotic and it slowly began to fade and go away. Other medical history was reported as Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), eczema, psoriasis. The concomitant medications included unspecified Birth control, vitamin b complex (VITAMIN B) and ergocalciferol (VIT D). No other vaccine in four weeks. After second vaccine patient had a typical immune response- headache, body aches, chills, etc on the first day after vaccination and then on the second day post vaccination the redness around the site came back. Patient worried it was going to continue to grow again. The outcome of events was unknown.

Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), eczema, and psoriasis; all from an unknown date. Patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications included vitamin b complex, ergocalciferol (VIT D), and birth control. It was reported that with patient&#39;s first vaccine, the patient had redness to the site the day after injection (22Dec2020). It was probably about a quarter to half dollar in size and was red and inflamed but went away and faded as the week went on. Then about a week after that vaccine (reported as &#39;27Dec2020 19:00&#39;), the redness came back but it was itchy, hot to touch, and hard. Over the next day or so it grew quite large. The patient visited a physician, and was placed on an oral antibiotic and it slowly began to fade and go away. The outcome of the events was recovered.

A 29-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Unknown lot number and expiration), intramuscular in left upper arm on 31Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included cat allergy/seasonal and animal allergies. Concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) for cat allergy. The patient previously received flu shot for immunization on unspecified date.  The patient reported that she received the first dose of vaccine on 31Dec2020 and experienced soreness (a little bit) but was no difference from the flu shot. Last night (18Jan2021), hives started to appear. She took a Zyrtec this morning (19Jan2021) that she usually takes at night to alleviate the symptoms. She takes Zyrtec because she has a cat allergy and also reported to have changed her laundry detergent. The patient was wondering if there have been any reports of delayed allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine. She said that she just got hives on her lower legs with sporadic patches on other places of her body including her upper legs, some on her arm, some on her torso and her upper chest last night. She may have some on her back, but she has not looked yet. She has had this type of reaction before with an antibiotic in the past. She is supposed to get the second dose on Thursday 21Jan2021. She noticed the hives last night and they seem to have gotten a little bit worse overnight but are about the same since she has gotten up. She said that she has allergies, but they are seasonal and animal allergies. She has also been using the same body wash and laundry detergent and stated that nothing has really changed with her. She also said that her partner that lives with her has not had any skin issues. The patient had not yet recovered from the event hives, while unknown outcome for the remaining event.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Hot flashes include tachycardia, excessive perspiration, reddening of skin, intense warmth of skin and were followed by chills and my color flushing. Also experiencing night sweats that results in insomnia. This has caused a general interruption to my daily life. The hot flashes continued to get more intense over the past several weeks. I have not had my menstrual cycle since my second injection.

Not much longer and the hives/itching spread down my back and chest. Face became swollen. Benadryl cream was initially attempted, but only briefly subsided the itching and reaction continued spreading. I took oral quick release Benadryl and was able to prevent the reaction from continuing. I had to take a secondary Benadryl dose a few hours later and extreme joint pain accompanied the allergic reaction.

Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

The next morning I had a fever and my joints, muscles, head and even my skin was hurting. My fever never came down to normal even with advil and I was extremely tired all day.  The arm that had the injection is extremely sore with splotches of red (which is expected.) Today, 01/08, I woke up in a pool of sweat. My head is still hurting and I still have a fever. My arm is still sore but my skin and joint pain has improved. I am still very cold. Have been wearing my winter coat in my house even with the heat and the fire place on. I had to take the last two days off work.

                                                I developed mild injection site pain about 5 minutes after the second dose which didn?t happen the first time so quickly. It shortly progressed to a cold/numb sensation from my deltoid down to my finger tips. This persisted but seemed to transition from more numbness to moderate pain from my left scapula, neck and down to my fingers about 7 hours after the vaccine. I also developed intermittent fasiculations of my forearm muscles on the left arm. This morning I woke up with worsening pain, mild numbness but new weakness in the hand and arm. I have a weak grip and can?t fully grab objects. My wrist flexión and extension are also weak as well as shoulder abduction (I am a neurologist by the way so can?t localize it to any nerve distribution). I?m not weak anywhere else and I only have mild arthralgia and diarrhea systemically.

                                                Wednesday 1/13/2021 I woke up feeling like nauseous, then later in the day I started to get itchy in my lower body that was coming and going (I believe I still had some allegra d in my system). On  Thursday 01/14/2021 by noon time the itching had become extreme and unbearable all over my body and felt like my skin was crawling/burning, my chest and parts of my arms were really red . I also developed a lump in my throat that kept getting bigger and felt itchy and couldn&#39;t stop clearing my throat. Around 3pm I took 10ml of Claritin. The Claritin had not really helped however the redness had gone down a lot and by 4:30 I was miserable. Informed by a provider I work with to go to urgent care. I arrived at urgent care at about 5:10 where I was treated for an allergy reaction. I was given  0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 500mL, Methylprednisolone sod suc(PF) (SOLU-Medrol) 125mg Intravenous, Famotidine (Pepcid) 20mg/2ml injection 20mg intravenous, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50mg/ml injection 25mg intravenous.  The itching subsided within 30 minutes, the itchy throat/ lump was still present but was not getting worse and slowly improving.   I was discharged home and was told to pick up famotidine 20mg, otc benadryl and prednisone 50mg to take for 5 days.  got home a little after 7 and was able to eat dinner, let dog out, shower, rest  before going to bed. I did take another 10 ml of Benadryl at 10:30. Woke up without any itchy skin at 5:45 and was able to return to work this morning. I still have a slight itchy throat but it is tolerable. I took allegra d and famotidine this morning. I am holding off on the prednisone because of the immune response to vaccines from steroids. I don&#39;t want to lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine.

                                                Two days after receiving my 2nd dose, I began noticing a rash on my stomach that initially appeared like hives. The rash then turned into small red bumps all over my back and stomach the next day. It is one week later and the rash is still extensive (now on armpits, neck and mild on legs). It itches slightly but not bad.  I have tried hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl without much benefit.

                                                On the evening and day following receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chills, body muscle aches, headache, and fever (99.7-100.2 degrees). I was unable to get out of bed or go to work. I took ibuprofen at first, for my muscle pain but was told I should instead take Tylenol to reduce my fever and address my pain. My fever and chills recurred last night at about 8pm and I took more Tylenol.   Today, I am still experiencing some pain in my arm (injection site) and some chills/dizziness, but am taking Tylenol and have not experienced any recurring fever since last night. I am continuing to drink a lot of fluid and take a low dose of Tylenol at regular intervals.

About 6 hrs after vaccine, I felt soreness at the injection site, very similar to the flu vaccine. About 12Hours post vaccine, my arm was so sore I could not lift it. That night I took two Tylenol and had to wrap my arm in a heating pad. I woke up around 3am that following morning with a fever of 104 F. I was so dizzy from the high fever. I felt extremely nauseated. My body ached mostly in my legs and lower back. It hurt to sit on the toilet, to put on clothes. My Fevers happened at night time ranging from 102-104F for 4 days. My injection site soreness lasted for 7 days. Body aches lasted around 2-3 days. Dizziness subsided after my fever broke, but was replaced with a severe headache lasting 2 days.

                                                I was totally fine for 4 hours. After 4 hours I started to get injection site pain, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, joint pain, fever, feeling unwell, and swollen lymph nodes. All of this lasted for 2 days. At the end of the 24 hour mark I started having a heartbeat 15-20 bpm higher than my normal, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. I&#39;m now 3.5 days post vaccine dose 1 and still having all of the symptoms in my last sentence plus extreme exhaustion, muscle pain, and fever.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283) solution for injection, intramuscular on right arm 14Jan2021 12:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chronic sinusitis due to allergies, asthma; allergies to corn, wheat, Penicillin, Sulfa, and cephalosporins. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications included ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (AUROVELA FE 1/20), and salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA). The patient experienced hives - full body on 14Jan2021 17:00 (as reported), experienced it approximately 4-6 hours after receiving vaccine. It was resolved with Benadryl. Patient stated that to be fair, she has a lot of allergies and she does occasionally experience full body hives on days when she has not received a vaccine or changed her diet/detergents. Patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. Patient has not been tested for COVID-19 after receiving the vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

After three hours they discharged me . I felt  Tachycardia for about two days after. After the 2-3 day I felt better.  I had another Tachycardia episode  on January 25,2021- I was scheduled to get my second dose but didn&#39;t get it done.  It just hit me and my heart rate went up, it has not gone away and have been dealing with it for about two weeks. I have a heart monitor on me.  I saw a Gastrologist and they want to do an EGD to rule out ulcers.  I&#39;m not able to eat without feeling a hot rush and my heart rate going up.  I have lost 12lbs since the 20th.

The symptoms were severe from 7:30 pm on Monday, the day of the dose (vaccine received at 9:30AM), until 5:30 PM Tuesday (approximately 22 hours). The symptoms were relieved by taking extra strength tylenol every 4 hours. The symptoms were lessened, but still present until 9:30 AM on Wednesday.  I was still suffering from a minor headache all day Thursday. I also had soreness in the injection site, there was no swelling or redness that I noticed; the soreness was mostly gone by Thursday. I have had a left eyelid twitch in the past (randomly), it returned after the vaccine and was very bothersome. Today is Thursday and the eyelid twitch is still bothering me.

At around 1am on 1/14/21 I woke up with a fever of 101*F that lasted for roughly 6 hours. Fever eventually subsided after taking tylenol, drinking a lot of water, and using an ice pack. Still had some residual lethargy that lingered until the end of 1/15/2021.

                                                I woke up 4 days later 2/12, with both ear clogged or ear fullness. I felt out of balanced and a little light headed. I also felt like my hearing was less. Next day 2/13 I only felt ear fullness on my left ear. 2/15 I woke up feeling fine. A week later 2/19 I woke up with the injection site hurting along with my leg ear clogged again. Again I felt out of balanced and light headed. I went to see an audiologist on the third day 2/21 while my ear was still clogged. They didn&#39;t see any wax or ear infection. They did a hearing test which showed normal hearing but worse on the left ear than the right. They told me I should see an ENT. 2/22 I woke up feeling fine. 2/24 I was asymptomatic when I went to see the ENT and my hearing test was normal but when they did a videonystagmography it showed significant positional nystagmus.

                                                Right after the second dose less than 2 minutes my heart rate began to spike. I could feel my heart pumping fast. I couldn?t sit due to this so I began pacing the room. I didn?t know this was a side affect so I thought I was over thinking the second dose. I attributed this to all the worry and doubt the media and people around me try pumping in your head. I thought I was having a panic attack. I didn?t alert any of the medical team there because again, I thought I was over thinking it. A few hours later my heart rate had gone down. My Apple Watch helped me monitor this. The next day I felt pain at the injection site, not my normal self, groggy. Slightly feverish and chilled. I work in a cold environment so I couldn?t quite tell if the chilled feeling was a side effect, or the room. Later that evening around 9pm things took a turn. I began running a low grade fever and was shaking from being so cold. About another hour late my fever was up to 101 and I was still shaking from being so cold. I took about 600mg of ibuprofen. I couldn?t sleep, tossed and turned. Probably another hour later my temperature was 102, still shaking uncontrollably. Covered in about 5 blankets I kept waiting it out. And I?d say around 2-3am I could feel my fever breaking. By late morning my temp was back to normal but I felt achy still. Tired, sore. Definitely sore at my injection site. And I don?t know if this is worth mentioning or not but just haven?t been able to shake that panic attack feeling. Like a worry or a dread over me. I just don?t feel as clear-headed as I did before. This is my biggest concern. Just don?t feel myself yet.

I also started to have some swelling in my throat by 4 days after the second dose and ended up going to immediate care for a steroid injection which began to provide relief by the next morning.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiration date: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included testing positive for COVID in Apr2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took flu shot and experienced soreness. The patient did not receive any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient called in regards to Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She received her first vaccine last Thursday, 07Jan2021. She was not sure if she can report this as a side effect, but she had some rashes appear just today (11Jan2021), at midnight, in her neck and chest area. The rashes were going away, but she still has some itching. She also stated that she took some over-the-counter diphenhydramine (BENADRYL, UPC: 1254717031, lot number: PJF044, expiration date: Jun2021) tablets to relieve the symptoms. She explained that she started to experience soreness/ pain at the injection site a few hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The pain in her arm has already went away. She noticed a swollen lymph in her armpit area on Friday morning, 08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still a little bit swollen. She didn&#39;t expect on getting a rash since she read symptoms only appear around 2-3 days only. Therefore, she is not sure if she can report this as a side effect because its been like 3 days already. She noticed the rash just today, at midnight. She stated that she is still itchy. She stated that there is just a little bit of itchiness in her neck. She felt a little bit warm and itchy in her chest area, at midnight (unspecified date), and she kept scratching. She knows she shouldn&#39;t have done that but it was itchy. The patient would consider these events to be non-serious. She did have some soreness with a flu shot before so it&#39;s not too serious. She explained she is a healthcare worker. She works in a nursing home facility and they asked if she wanted to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and she filled out the form. She also explained that she doesn&#39;t have any allergies to any medications. So, with the rashes that came, she is not really sure what is the cause of it. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. She stated she wanted to report this information but she also needs advice on whether she needs to continue taking Benadryl. Her rash is improving, but she is still a little bit itchy. She doesn&#39;t have any shortness of breath or anything. It&#39;s not a major reaction, just a little bit of a rash/itchiness in her chest and neck area. The outcome of the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 10Jan2021, for lymphadenopathy and rash was recovering, for pruritus was not recovered and for feeling hot was unknown.

                                                Within minutes and almost instantaneously, as the shot was being injected, my arm tingled.  Then it moved to my mouth  and tongue.  The roof of my mouth, and tongue became numb.  I needed to think really hard how to swallow.  It was like I could not figure out how to work that muscle.  I took benadryl, to ease symptoms.  It helped but did not take it away.  Next day, mouth and tongue still numb, and my ears, eyes, nose and throat were itchy.  My external skin was also itchy.  My doctor put me on a steroid pack. 4 days later, I am doing much better still not 100% percent myself, but very close to being back to normal. Still have slight sensation in tongue.

                                                About an hour after getting the shot, I did get extremely light headed and pulled my car over to get gas. I then noticed a rash all down the arm I got the vaccine and all over my chest and up my neck. I felt extremely hot. I got back in my car and sat at the gas station waiting for the lightheadedness to pass. I did call my GP at that time to make sure everything was OK. The nurse said that it sounds like a reaction but as long as I do not feel like I can not breathe or that my throat was swelling I should be ok. They advised me to eat something and also take benadryl once I got home. Rash stayed for a total of 2 days and today (3rd day) I only have a rash at the injection site. Its very red and hot to touch. Other symptoms I have/still have was very bad headache, fever (highest was 102.8 and today 3 days later is still over 101). Body aches, chills and the first 24 hours I felt like my internal organs were hot (sounds really weird!)

Nauseous, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, body aches (extreme), joint pain especially in hips and knees, extreme fatigue, headaches, ears constantly rang. Rash on my arm where I received it went down to my elbow and up to my shoulder and on to my upper back, about 3 hours for it show up. It red, raised and bumpy and it felt hot. This lasted for 4 days. I was very pale and my eyes were sunken in. I literally felt like I was ran over by a vehicle.   I was sleeping for about 15 hours a day.

She had premedicated with Benadryl 12.5mg along with Zyrtec. After itching started she was given an additional 12.5 mg of Benadryl. She was monitored for &gt;30 minutes with improvement of symptoms. Rash still present but she said no longer has itching and that she knew her body well and that she was fine to leave. She stated that her mother was in the car waiting for her since she knew that she might have this type of reaction. We had a long discussion about going to the ER but she said she has Benadryl on her if needed and knew when she needed to get to an ER in terms of symptomatology. We also discussed option of having next dose with an allergist. She would like to call her allergist to discuss options but feels comfortable getting 2nd dose knowing how she reacted this time.

                                                At the time of the second vaccination in the series, I was  17 weeks pregnant with an estimated date of delivery of 6/21/21. I have had an uncomplicated pregnancy. About 12 hours after vaccination, I woke up in the middle of the night around 2:30am with chills and body aches and had a temperature of 100.7.  I also had a headache, soreness at the site of injection, and a mild stomach ache. I took Tylenol every 6 hours starting 1 hour prior to vaccination and throughout the next day but continued to have temperatures ranging from 100.4 to 101.3 associated with chills, body aches, headache, and severe fatigue.  I continued to have these symptoms until about 9pm that night. Once the fever broke, the majority of symptoms subsided, but I did continue to have a daily headache for about one week after the vaccine.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

I stated to have some facial swelling then my throat started to swell/tighten.  I was brought to the ED and an IV was started. They administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The throat swelling started to interfere with my speaking and vocals. They monitored me for 7 hours then I was discharged home. All symptoms returned within a few hours and persisted for a week following. My PCP took over care and prescribed me the following in replace of the medications the ER prescribed: Albuterol HFA, Dexamethasome, Pepcid, Benadryl, Z-Pak, Vitamin D 100,000iu, and Fish Oil. I missed a week of week then was released to work again on 1/25/21.

A 31-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via Intramuscular on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was seen in the ED for petechiae and ecchymoses on 15Jan2021. She had not taken any recent medication or had any illness previous to this event. The only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series. Lab assessment showed platelet count decreased to 22,000 cells per cubic microliter (normal over 140,000). She had no other findings to describe cause of her decreased platelet count by lab or clinical exam. Provided a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia purpura, in the ED setting, she started pulse dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four consecutive days with a follow blood count showing resolution on day 4 of her treatment with a platelet count of 230,000 cells per cubic microliter. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received Steroids as treatment. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of event immune thrombocytopenia purpura was recovered in Jan2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of immune thrombocytopenia purpura due to temporal relationship. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including platelet count at baseline and during therapy with subject drug, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 31-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL3247, Expiry date 31May2021, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Jan2021 at 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization as frontline worker. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Hospital. The patient reported that she was fine all day Saturday (16Jan2021), she just had some very mild pain at the injection site started a couple hours after getting injection. She developed flu like symptoms on the following day (17Jan2021) at 18:00PM and threw up a couple times. On 18Jan2021 at noon she noticed that she could barely move her arm: anything above her elbow on her right arm was not moving; it was paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up. If someone were to pick it up and let go, she couldn&#39;t control it at all. She also stated that she had no pain at all in that arm; she couldn&#39;t feel anything at all; it was numb. When she woke up on 19Jan2021 the numbness had moved up her neck, instead of being localized to her arm. She stated that when she touched her neck, it hurt a little, but it was not super significant. She stated that it was debilitating at that point as she was maintaining numbness and &#34;no control of her arm&#34;. The nurse reported that this event had not required yet a visit to physician, but she has a feeling it will. She will probably have to go somewhere due to her paralyzed arm, but she had not yet. At the time of the report the event &#34;No control of her arm&#34;/can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; had not resolved yet; the event &#34;mild pain at the injection site&#34; resolved on 17Jan2021, the events &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; and &#34;Threw up a couple times&#34; were recovering and outcome of the events &#34;Numbness has moved up her neck&#34; and &#34;She touches her neck, it hurts a little&#34; was unknown.  The reporter assessed the events &#34;Pain injection site&#34; and &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; as non-serious and assessed the event &#34;Can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; as disabling. She assessed all the reported events as related to BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events numbness of upper extremity and arm paralysis with BNT162b2 use can not be fully excluded.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in the upper left arm on 21Jan2021 14:10 (at the age of 31-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergies to corn (zein). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine around 14:10 (scheduled for 14:00 but there was a line). Upon standing (21Jan2021 14:15), there was a &#34;pins-and-needles&#34; sensation down to the elbow, and by the time seated for the 15 minute wait, the sensation was present in the whole arm. The sensation was identical to a limb that was &#34;asleep&#34;, including the painful jolts whenever touched all the way to the tips of the fingers. This lasted until mid-morning 23Jan2021 (about 44 hours). Random several-inch-long patches of the arm were completely numb to physical sensation, mostly on the forearm (21Jan2021 14:15). These have shrunk but some are still present at the time of reporting. There was additional soreness to touch or movement of the entire upper arm inclusive of the shoulder (21Jan2021 14:15). The soreness aside from the injection site (21Jan2021 14:15) did not abate until late evening on 24Jan2021. The only noted adverse effects were related to physical sensation in the left arm. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of &#34;pins-and-needles&#34; sensation down to the elbow/sensation was identical to a limb that is &#34;asleep&#34;/including the painful jolts whenever touched was recovered on 23Jan2021. The clinical outcome of random several-inch-long patches of the arm were completely numb to physical sensation, mostly on the forearm; soreness to touch or movement of the entire upper arm inclusive of the shoulder; and soreness aside from the injection site, was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                The night of the second dose of my Pfizer Covid vaccine, my face began to feel hot and tight. The next day, I began with the expected flu like symptoms of the vaccine, accompanied by a red, fine bumpy rash with some swelling on my face where it had felt hot and tight the evening prior. The flu like symptoms lasted about 24 hours. The facial rash persisted and I began oral antihistamines - diphenhydramine and famotidine. The rash continued for one full week, only improving after beginning to use topical hydrocortisone on my face at the suggestion of a friend who is a nurse practitioner. After improvement in the rash I stopped hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash reappeared about 5 days later, and continues to randomly reappear about once a week to every 10 days. Flares only last about 24-36 hours now and will go away without medication but it does clear faster with hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash only flares at night, and no triggers like heat, alcohol or certain foods seem to bring it out.  I have been consistently taking famotidine and cetirizine daily since the last flare of the rash, and have not experienced a flare again yet.

                                                Bee sting on sole of foot morning of getting her second Pfizer dose. She then had a &#34;spider bite&#34; on her abdomen the next day. About 3 days later she developed an itching, lacy, red rash on dorsum of foot and sought care at an urgent care. She was given cephalexin for the spider bite and prednisone 40 for the bee sting. She had never had a reaction to bee stings before and no history of any anaphylaxis. She then came to see me, and I noted the rash with a red rash also over her left second toe with no signs of arterial occlusion or neurologic symptoms.  She had no symptoms or known Covid exposure and the community positivity rate was 1%. We decided to try a high potency topical corticosteroid for the itching on her foot and use the prednisone if symptoms worsened or go to the ER if severe. The next morning, (7 days post vaccination) she reported lightheadedness, increased pruritus of her foot and went to an urgent care where she started systemic prednisone and had a negative Covid nasopharyngeal swab.  She then recovered without complications.

Felt dizzy and disoriented and called her allergist. She carries epi pen because she gets allergy shots due to dog and cat allergies. Epi pen is for potential reaction to allergy shot. Allergist advised her to call EMS. She called EMS and they told her to administer the epi pen. She administered epi pen and began to feel symptoms improve. EMS arrived and she felt better and was not transported to the hospital. She drove herself home and was fine the rest of the day. She also had a topical reaction to the band-aid on her arm, with blisters and ripping off her skin. She generally has allergy issues with adhesives.

A 31-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 04Apr2021 10:45 (Lot Number: ER8732) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypoglycaemia (she ate before the injection) and fainting. Concomitant medication(s) included Birth control and prednisolone acetate ophthalmic sus. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. 5 minutes after the injection, the patient began having an odd taste in mouth, shortness of breath, and she fainted. She had a history of fainting, but it took longer for her to recover than usual (50 minutes instead of 15). When she regained consciousness a few minutes after, she had a headache, felt overheated, and could quite literally only see stars. Her breathing took 40 minutes to return to normal, and her body temperature took 2 hours to feel normal. She assumed this was mostly a vasovagal syncope response, but she wasn&#39;t anxious or in pain beforehand. After 6 hours, she still have the odd taste, a headache, and the expected sore injection site. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Paramedic took vitals and monitored for an hour. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                hives all over body; UTI; huge cold sore on nose; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other HCP (patient). A non-pregnant 31-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration at Left Arm on 26Jan2021 17:30 (at age of 31 years old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies: Sulfa. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC); vitamin d nos; clarithromycin (MACROBID). The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: Ek9231) on 07Jan2021 05:30 PM at left arm at 31 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. No COVID prior vaccination. Nasal Swab on 09Mar2021 was Negative. On 26Jan2021 09:00 PM, within 5 hours of getting my second vaccination, patient broke out in hives all over body. Patient called doctor and was prescribed steroids to help with the hives as antihistamines were not helping. A few days later patient woke up with a huge cold sore on nose which patient never had before. The same day patient was experiencing symptoms of a UTI and was prescribed Macrobid which had taken several times before. Within an hour of taking it patient&#39;s body was covered in hives and throat started to close. Patient immediately went to urgent care where received a shot of Benadryl. Patient was confident this reaction would not have happened if patient had not had this vaccine. AE resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Treatment (Prednisone and a shot of Benadryl) received. The outcome of the events was recovered in 2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Hives, UTI, Cold sores cannot be excluded.

Sx worsened on day 5, so I had a virtual visit with a medical provider who prescribed me Valtrex x7d to treat suspected Herpes Zoster, which I previously had in my early 20s.

A 32-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot number EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 12:30 as a single dose (dose 1) in the left arm (age at vaccination: 32 years old) for COVID-19 vaccination. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered wasa hospital. There were no other vaccines given in the 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included diagnosed with COVID-19 on 06Jul2020, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), cervical spondylosis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV); no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), valacyclovir, levonorgestrel (LILETTA), and colecalciferol (VITAMIN D). The patient woke up at 0400 on 22Dec2020 with tympanic temp of 100.8, chills, body aches, and very tender left deltoid injection site pain. The events were reported as non-serious. Treatment with ibuprofen resolved the elevated temperature, however she spent all of 22Dec2020 with fatigue and body aches despite ibuprofen. The tender left deltoid persisted for a total of 3 days and then became more tolerable, less tender. The clinical outcome of elevated temp/ tympanic temp of 100.8 was resolved on 22Dec2020, of fatigue and body aches was recovered on 23Dec2020, and of chills and tender left deltoid was recovered on an unknown date. Since the vaccination, has the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Recieved the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccination on Dec 26th 2020, and had no major adverse reaction to vaccine except for mild soreness and heat around injection site and intense fatigue for three days after. Symptoms went away after the 4th day. Two weeks later on Jan 5th 2021, i began to notice an intense itching, burning, and swelling at the injection site. Pain and soreness in arm made it difficult to do my job and seem to just get worse. Upon the next morning of Jan 6th 2021, pain remained but itching had gone down, but intense burning, soreness and massive redness around injection site remained and seemed to be getting worse. Pain remains and redness has not gone down, arm is very tender near site and lifting and moving arm is very stiff and sore. Feeling of lump or stiffness on injection site comes and goes and feeling of heavy and sore muscles move from upper left arm down to elbow and extend to hand; making movement and function slowed or slightly numb. Stiffness in arm and intense heat at injection site makes it uncomfortable to move or use arm. Cold tingling sensation on occasion and stiffness in elbow joint. Slight dizziness and fatigue follow with pain in arm. Was informed to see a physician on Jan 6th, 2021 who said to fill out vaccination adverse event report and to keep an eye on arm. If pain or symptoms become worse to return.

                                                within 1 hr post-vaccine on 1/7 I had a mild headache that resolved with Tylenol. At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

                                                Severe soreness in left upper arm at location of the shot about 5 hours after the shot, the pain extended into the armpit/lymph area of my left arm and the pain remained steadily severe until Friday 1/15- 3 days after the initial injection. At 1pm on day of shot (1/12/21) had feelings of chills, sweaty and whole body aches. This lasted until Thursday morning 1/14 around 7am. During that time, took Tylenol for the aches and feverish feelings.    Arm soreness finally subsided Friday. migraines started Thursday evening into Saturday morning. With little relief from Imitrex (prescription medication for chronic migraines). Went to the emergency room Saturday for a shot of Torodal for the migraine to subside.

The following morning my arm was still sore and I developed a blister behind my left ear and swollen lymph-nodes. The soreness in my arm went away however the blister became worse and started erupting with puss and the lymph-node became larger, tender, and developed sharp . shooting pain. I went to urgent care  on 1/3/2020 and was given oral antibiotics and an antibiotic cream for the blisters. A swab culture was taken for possible shingles. On 1/4/20 I went to clinic as the pain had worsen and resulted in a numbing sensation on my left cheek. The doctor prescribed me antivirals for Shingles and I was given an antibiotic shot in the butt.   I was off work for two weeks. The pain went away around 1/15/20.  The blisters are healed.

Noticed some discoloration of the injection site on Sunday/Monday. By Monday night a small lump and redness had reappeared. Tuesday morning the lump had gotten bigger and hot to the touch, itchy as well. Wednesday even itchier and bigger and hotter. Went to urgent care and was given cephalexin for cellulitis. Today is a Thursday, the itchiness has gone down but the lump is much bigger and still warm to the touch.

                                                I received the first dose of vaccine on 12/17/20 with no symptoms initially other than soreness at injection site.  4-5 days post vaccine I began to have mild sinus drainage, headaches,  and backaches that I attributed to allergies, stress, and sinus issues.  On the evening of 12/23/20, I had lost my sense of smell completely and had diminished taste.  I was tested for COVID-19 around 0830 the next morning on 12/24/20 and was positive for the virus.  That day and the 7-8 days that followed I was extremely fatigued with muscle aches.  I continued to participate in the V-safe surveys and made note that I was having these symptoms likely because I was positive for COVID-19 (as of 12/24/20).  The CDC called and I relayed this information to them and it was decided that a report was not necessary.  After my second dose of vaccine on 01/07/21, I received another call from the CDC and it was recommended that I do file a report so data could be collected on those who have tested positive for COVID-19 after the initial vaccine.  I had no significant symptoms after my second vaccine and have presumably fully recovered from the virus to date.

She really didn?t think anything of it and did not report it to anyone or take any medication for it.  On 1/12/2021 she received the 2nd dose.  On day 7 of her vaccine she developed hives on her lower extremities. She took Benadryl that day and they improved, but did not got away.  On day 8 the hives reapproved and she took a dose of Claritin and that got her through working.  On day 9 (yesterday) the hives have migrated from just her lower extremities to her arms and shoulders.  She took both Zyrtec and Benadryl yesterday, but she is not getting any relief.

Then, the evening of 1/20, I developed hives all over both legs. They were still there the next morning and I took Benadryl and later loratadine and they eventually went down. Later in the evening on 1/21 they came back so I took a Zyrtec and the next morning they were worse and were on my legs and arms and shoulders. I called employee health and the doctor directed me to take Zyrtec twice daily and also to take a Pepcid daily. At this point in the afternoon on 1/22, I still have the hives but they seem to be slightly improving as the day goes on.

I also did not feel well- with a headache, fatigue, and was very overheated/sweaty. When I woke up on 1/27/21 I felt much better, but the symptoms around the injection site remained the same. Today, 1/28/21, the redness has increased in size, the lump has increased in size, however it is not as firm to the touch. I was prescribed antibiotics by my PCP.

                                                I had a full arm rash and all over itching including some in my throat shortly after taking the vaccine. We knew I was allergic so I had taken medication in advance. Once rash started, two medications were taken- Vistaril and Zyrtec. This seemed to help it go away some though I am still experiencing it. I have alpha gal and I believe that is what made me have a reaction to the vaccine.

Then at 1700 I could barely move with severe body aches and headache. Attempted to drink some water and eat soup, but intestines burned too much.

Upon waking on 1/29/21 noticed a petechiae type rash on both sides of my face, sore throat and mild headache (took tylenol). 1/30/21 no symptoms and facial rash slowly disappearing.

A 32-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 27Jan2021 16:00 (lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in public health department. The patient&#39;s medical history includes sciatic nerve pain, allergic to cats and some dogs, back pain from scoliosis and anemic, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks. The patient did not receive any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested after the vaccination for COVID-19. The patient stated her left hand turned blue and the veins in that hand looked very dark (almost purple) seconds after receiving the vaccine in the left arm on 27Jan2021 16:00. Her left hand turned blue like it was cold, but she was not cold anywhere on my body. Her left hand&#39;s veins were also mostly purple in the fingertips. The side effect was not painful and lasted about 30 minutes. Other symptoms experienced because of the COVID-19 vaccine in left arm were soreness across entire arm, especially at injection site occurred upon injection and was slowly getting better. The patient took two 200mg of ibuprofen two days (however the patient also reported no treatment was received for the events) after the injection because the pain randomly got worse without any outward cause, swollen injection site occurred upon injection and is the same at this time. Tingling across entire arm occurred upon injection and stopped seven hours later at 11pm. The consumer assessed the events as non-serious. The outcome of the event tingling across entire arm recovered on 27Jan2021 at 11 PM and &#34;my left hand turned blue and the veins in that hand looked very dark (almost purple)&#34; was recovered on 27Jan2021 and outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Immediately after getting the vaccine, I noticed a strong metallic taste in my mouth. The metallic taste lasted for approximately 5 days, decreasing in strength over time. Within 10-15 minutes of getting the vaccine, parts of my face went partially numb (primarily under my lips and along my right cheek). The numbness was largely improved after 1.5 weeks, but I continue to experience it intermittently 3&#43; weeks later. I also had severe jaw pain that lasted for about 2 weeks, on and off. Within about an hour of receiving the vaccine, I noticed a small amount of rectal bleeding as well; this resolved within the same day. Beyond that, my symptoms were &#34;normal&#34; -- pain at the injection site, mild nausea and chills on the day of the vaccine. I spoke with 5 different doctors about the facial numbness, and none of them were able to advise me on why that might have happened. My primary care physician recommended against getting the second shot until we have more information about what would cause these side effects.

                                                Within 2 minutes of vaccine receipt the patient became agitated. She was noted to have erythematous macules on her upper back consistent with hives. Her heart rate and respiration rates were normal. She was observed initially as the family reported that she gets hives with all injections. However, about 2 minutes later she began to retch and stated that her throat was burning and she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was administered 0.3mg of epinephrine via an autoinjector. Her shortness of breath and throat burning symptoms resolved almost immediately. She was then given 10mg of Cetirizine PO and transported via local EMS for evaluation at the Hospital ED.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 32-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL3302; Expiration date was not reported) on 04Feb2021 (10:00) at a single dose on the left arm, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy/drug store (not a military facility). The patient did not have relevant medical history. Concomitant medication included ongoing amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). The patient previously took a flu shot a couple of months ago, and had no reaction. On 04Feb2021 (10:00), the pharmacy reportedly screwed up, and gave the patient an entire vial of BNT162B2 instead of one dose. The patient was not feeling any side effects then. In Feb2021, the patient had a giant red circle/rash; and she was really swollen, inflamed and in pain (reported as &#34;painful&#34;). The patient did not receive any treatment for the giant red circle/rash and pain. The outcome of the events was recovering for &#39;giant red circle/rash&#39;, &#39;really swollen&#39;, &#39;inflamed&#39; and &#39;pain&#39;; and was unknown for &#39;gave the patient an entire vial of BNT162B2 instead of one dose&#39;. The reporter had asked about whether she should receive the second dose.  Follow-up (08Feb2021): New information received from a contactable consumer (patient) included: reporter information, suspect vaccine details and new events (&#39;giant red circle/rash&#39;, &#39;really swollen&#39;, &#39;inflamed&#39; and &#39;pain&#39;).

                                                I received the vaccine in the left arm on 12/23 with no immediate symptoms. On 12/24 I had body aches mostly on my left side. On 12/25, I started having a strong headache, focused mostly on the left side. On 12/26 the headache continued and I also noticed swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, and behind my ears. Also, it felt like someone had broken my nose and when I would try to bite down or chew I would have a sharp pain and pressure in my nose and sinuses. On 12/27, the headache continued, and I had severe left eye pain, as well as pain chewing and the swollen nodes, that became painful to touch. On 12/28, I went to my PCP and was tested for covid, which was negative. She diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed amoxicillin. On 12/29, I noticed my scalp had lumps on it that were painful and I had a very itchy spot on my forehead, which became swollen as well to about a quarter size lump. I also had other painful spots on my scalp all over and a continued severe headache and left eye pain. I tried to follow up with my PCP on 12/31, but their office was closed, and the on call nurse referred me to urgent care. More painful, swollen lymph nodes have appeared on my face and neck. I wasn&#39;t able to be seen at urgent care until today (1/1), and was then diagnosed with Shingles. I was told to continue amoxicillin and to start taking Valtrex. I am very itchy, mostly on my face, scalp, and left side of my body.

My throat felt itchy and they immediately gave me benedryl.  I was tahycardic as well. When I got home from the ER that night I had to take more benedryl and then the next morning  I was still itchy and my voice was hoarse so I took more xyzal and famotidine. The rash subsided and I continued taking xyzal twice a day , benedryl and famotidine for a week.  After my vaccine the itching did not subside for about 48 hours and it was very difficult to control. I had to take max doses of antihistamines to control the hoarseness In my voice and itching

                                                After 6-10 minutes of the injection , I started having shooting pain from the injection site, through my left clavicle area to around the back of my neck. After 15 minutes those muscles described started tensing and my muscles in the back of my neck tightened to the point I can?t look left to right (turning motion). It?s now Almost 3 hours after and symptoms remain same.

                                                Several minutes after getting the shot, my chest started to feel tight and I needed to use my rescue inhaler.  I stayed at the Clinic until 30 minutes had been up. When I arrived home I needed to use my Albuterol Nebulizer Solution, and started to get slightly itchy. My chest didn&#39;t start to feel better until after 2am, and the next day I noticed my arm at the injection site was swollen and slightly red.  It is still red to this day and it feels achy all the way to my wrist.

The morning of 1/9/21 I developed a fever, head ache and noticed a red, tender area the size of a penny at the injection site. During the weekend the area around the injection site continued to grow. 1/11/21 I noticed the area is itchy, red, tender/tight feeling, and warm. Pain only when the area is touch. This area is 3.5inchs W by 3 inchs L.

                                                On Sunday 12/20 I started to get a significant sharp headache on the left side that radiated down my left neck and arm to the point of injection site. My left arm was also sore as to be expected with typical injection but this sensation was different. It caused a sharp neuromuscular pain that was also itchy/burning. Extended in the region of sternocleidomastoid site. No rash development but seemed like symptoms of shingles. Continued through until approx 12/26/20. Improved with heat pack, Tylenol and Motrin.   Was evacuated by physician on 12/21/20 with no testing or medication provided as symptoms were unclear.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the vaccine Pt said she developed a &#34;fruity&#34; taste in her mouth. She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

Throbbing in temples, eye pressure, pressure on top of head, worsened when I would bend over. Did not take any medication, worried it would impact immune response. Drank a lot of water, slept, did some sled massage, and gentle yoga/stretches. By that evening pain level had dropped down to about a 4. Woke up the next morning with 2-3 level pain, was able to go to work without being distracted by pain. Still felt more pressure behind eyes and top of head when I bent over. Next day all symptoms resolved, except very minor tenderness at injection site only when palpated.

Developed symptoms of COVID that Monday - five days after vaccine. Tested COVID positive that same day. Started with headache, then I had a fever over 101. Chills - bad chills. Lost my taste and smell a couple days after that and that lasted a long  time (about three days to get smell back and 10 days for taste). Just took Tylenol for the fever and headache. Also got leg pain - muscle type aches - painful - started on the 29th of December. Leg pain lingered and the pain went away by about the 7th of January. Took Tylenol as needed for that pain.

Could not sleep because of chills. Next morning, developed severe legs pains and deep muscle pain - both legs - both calves, both sides. Resulted in me having to miss that day of work. I called my Dr&#39;s office and they advised to go to ER for severe leg pain. I didn&#39;t because I had a pharmacist that I work with who had advised me that I could wait. Similar symptoms to when I got COVID (on Dec 28th). Did have the same moderate arm pain in location of vaccine. Fever stayed above 100 for 48 hours. And the chills went away after 12 hours.  Around the clock Tylenol that stated when I got the vaccine - 1000 mg every six hours scheduled. Fever resolved after 2 days. Chills after 12 hours. Leg pain from severe on 15th - to moderate pain next day and on 18th the pain is more mild. Pain in legs haven&#39;t resolved entirely but much better.

                                                allergic reaction; large red itchy rash on her neck / chest area; trembling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 33-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via unspecified route of administration (lot number: EL1283) in the arm right on 07Jan2021 09:00; at single doses for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: latex. Concomitant medications included magnesium oxide (MAG OXIDE) at 200 mg, daily (every day) and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) at 10 mg, daily (every day); and toprolol at 25 mg, every day (pending clarification for the drug). The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on 17Dec2020 (lot number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination; and has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. Within the 15-minute observation period on 07Jan2021, the patient developed a large red itchy rash on her neck and chest area; she stated she felt fine but was observed trembling. She was transported to ED (emergency department, 5 min transport). She was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) at 25mg IV X1 (intravenous), and methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL) at 60mg IV X1 and famotidine 20mg IV X 1. Patient diagnosis was allergic reaction on 07Jan2021. Patient improved after treatment and was discharged (after being in Emergency room/department or urgent care) as she was observed from 09:11 until 10:33. Final outcome of the events was all recovered on unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the allergic reaction, rash erythematous and trembling are possibly related to suspect BNT62B2 administration.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I took 650 mg Tylenol, fell back asleep, woke up at 330 am sweating and less achy. Awoke again at 7 am with terrible headache, nausea and upset stomach. Injection site swollen, reddened and painful to touch; took another 650 mg of Tylenol without much relief. Entire body was extremely sensitive to the slightest bit of touch or pressure. Had a hazy feeling in my head, felt mildly dizzy for hours. Around 230 pm on 1/19/21 I began sweating profusely for about 15 minutes and when that ceased  I felt almost back to normal immediately. By the following day I was feeling 100% OK other than injection site discomfort. Today, 1/23, is the first day since receiving my second dose that my arm Only slightly hurts and itches.

Then I check the rest of my body and found more. I took benadryl and zyrtec on the 5th and then feel asleep. I woke up in the middle the night to see that they had doubled eone in my private parts. I went to urgent care and they gave me a steroid injection, prescriptions for pepcid, a steroid pack and told me to continue to take the benadryl and zrytec. The hives have gone down, but I feel very weak and tired. It occured around 8:30 Friday night (2/5) and I am sorry I didn&#39;t fill out the form last night. i got the shot this morning at 8:30 am. I had a slight fever this morning.

Ptaient did have a few red splotches on her chest, but these did not appear consistent with urticaria per the ED physician&#39;s report.

She continued to breathe easily with normal and stable vital signs.  She was discharged with instructions  to buy OTC Benadryl 25mg PO to take every 8 hours for 48 hours.

A 33-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK4176 intramuscular in left deltoid on 07Jan2021 as single dose (at the age of 33 years) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Patient had history of ongoing Autoimmune Thrombocytopenia from May2020, ongoing migraines, depression/anxiety and ADHD, and COVID-19 21Apr2020 to &#34;05May2021&#34;.  Concomitant medication included Sertraline Hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), Lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE), Lorazepam  (Ativan), Ondasetron (ZOFRAN) and Sumatriptan succinate (IMITREX).  Historical information regarding dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 17Dec2020 included a moderate injection site reaction lasting 6 days worst on day three. Reaction was characterized by redness, swelling elevated rash surrounding injection site, aching pain radiating from neck to fingers and tenderness to palpitation.  1st dose Vaccine Lot Number: EJ1685, Vaccine Lot Expire Date: Mar2021, Time the Vaccination Was given: 08:00.  After the 2nd dose the patient experienced a moderate headache on 08Jan2021 12:00 for 1 day which responded well to APAP- caffeine and resolved on 09Jan2021 12:00 Patient had a flare up of my autoimmune thrombocytopenia as evidenced by legs covered in petechiae and bruising on 09Jan2021. Emergency room and physician office were not visited however, patient does have standing CBC orders from hematologist, so she had platelet count checked. It had dropped to 109K/uL, which is low for me but not dangerous. Patient originally developed autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) May2021 after COVID Apr2021. Both instances of these side effects were manageable, but patient wanted to report them as there was no data yet available on ITP with the vaccine when she met with hematologist to discuss it. Patient received Acetaminophen 650mg PO (per oral) as treatment.  Lab data included Platelets 13Oct2020 124 kiU/L (normal 140-400) and on 12Jan2021 109 KiU/L.  Event flare up of my autoimmune thrombocytopenia resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00, Platelets dropped to 109k resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00, legs covered in petechiae and bruising resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00 and headache resolved 09Jan2021.

After approx. 30 minutes of receiving my shot my left side of my face felt numb including the left side of my tounge as well as muscle pain and soreness on the left side on the back of my neck. Today is 3/5/2021, my face is slowly becoming less numb over time and rest. I also experienced fatigue and injection site soreness. I am particularly concerned about my face becoming numb shortly after receiving my vaccine and I am wondering if I should get a second dose when I need to?

                                                After I received my first dose I started to experience my first symptom on March 30, 2021. I noticed that I had a small lump on the left side of my rib cage beside my left breast which was about the size of a sausage link. The area wasn&#39;t painful, slightly tender to the touch and soft. By 4/3/21 the area has expanded to the upper portion of the scapula and it was no longer located on the side of my rib. It was about the size a pear and it was inflamed and very tender to the touch. I couldn&#39;t raise my arm and it was pertruding from my clothing and preventing me from sleeping at night on that side. By 4/5/21 the mass had turned into a different shape and direction and it was no longer just primarily on my scapula.. This current shape favored a boomerang and it started on my lower scapula and wrapped around my arm going directly into the middle of my arm pit.. It was about an 1.5 inches wide, inflamed, painful and wouldn&#39;t allow me to fully lift my arm or lay on it.. The mass was hard and didn&#39;t move, I visited a prompt care and they couldn&#39;t decipher what it was. I began to take tylenol and use cold compress and over a few days the mass began to decrease in size and I was able to increase my range of motion obtaining full extension on 4/17/21. The mass is now smaller than a pencil on 4/22/21 and hardly noticable but it was quite an experience.

                                                I received the vaccine at 10:30 am. About two hours later I noticed a minor headache. By 4pm I had a moderate pounding headache. Around 4:30pm, I noticed minor unilateral scalp, facial and neck numbness on the left side. These symptoms lasted about a week, but slowly improved. Four days after the vaccine I had very tender lymph nodes on the left ear area. Today marks two weeks exactly since I received the vaccine and two days ago I noticed slight increase in numbness on the left cheek again which again, is slowly improving.  However, I also wear Invisalign at sometimes notice that I bite my cheek while asleep. I also wear N95 masks four days of the week which are quite tight on the face.   The injection site (Left deltoid) was moderately sore for the first few days and still two weeks later has minor soreness the comes and goes.

I went to Employee Health and was prescribed a steroid but I didnt take it and benedryl and claritin.  I took claritin and benedryl for about 2 days which began to make the rash subside on the 18 but on the 23rd the rash reappeared and went back to EH and was given another round of steroids which I did in fact take this time.  And after the 6th day of the steroid pack the rash has mostly resolved

Shortly after this I had moderate GI upset including diarrhea, cramping for about 24 hours.  Over the course of 48 hours after the vaccine I had swelling at the injection site, tenderness of the injection area to the point where I was not able to put pressure on the area or sleep on my left side and severe fatigue/malaise.    All symptoms resolved after 48 hours.  I am a person and wanted the reaction information to be part of the trial data.

This 34-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 05Jan 2021 12:50 on right arm at single dose (Lot # EK4176, Expiration Date: Mar2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were none. Past drug history included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Dec2020 16:00 at age of 34 year old at single dose (Lot # EH9899) for covid-19 immunisation. About 30 minutes after being administered (05Jan2021 13:20) that second dose she developed all over rash with some itching. She took Benadryl and Pepcid in response. Today the all over rash with some itching came back at the same persistent level. She wants to know what kind of timeframe she can expect with the continued allergic reaction of all over rash with some itching. She was made to check into the emergency room for observation, but did not have any testing/lab work/investigations done and was not admitted to the hospital. Outcome of the events was not recovered. Reporter seriousness for All over rash with some itching was Medically significant. Drug result was related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Rash and Itching cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Blood pressure 5 hours after was 134/85 which is still a slight elevation from my norm.

                                                Rash on neck; gall bladder attack; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 34-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 18Dec2020 10:30 at a single dose for  COVID-19 immunization in the hospital, and morphine sulfate (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose and frequency for an unspecified indication. Medical history included S/P rouxen-y gastric bypass, sleep apnea, cholelithiasis, HSV-2, obesity, and Hashimoto hypothyroid disease. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included ursodiol, valacyclovir, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTH) and vitamins. The patient previously took morphine and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient experienced Rash on neck, morphine reaction and May or may not be related - gall bladder attack on 18Dec2020 14:30. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was administered with NS bolus, diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and also morphine in response to the events. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19 via Nasal Swab/COVID-19 rapid ABBT which was negative on 18Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for morphine sulfate was unknown. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequel. The patient assessed the events as non-serious.   Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of morphine sulfate in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of morphine sulfate has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment hence, the events are conservatively assessed as related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 until further information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: Ek9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 08Jan2021 (at 11:00 PM as reported; pending clarification) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at the hospital. Relevant medical history included that the patient had known allergies to medications, food, or other products, but was not specified. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D), curcuma longa (TURMERIC) as supplement, and an unspecified multivitamin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Really severe joint pain and headache - not quite a migraine - no aura but very severe headache. Had to medicate with 1000 mg Tylenol and 600 of Advil. Headache for days. Pain at injection site and that has been with every vaccine I&#39;ve ever had. Headache went away within three or four days.  Joint pain was there for about two days. Only medicated the headache the first couple of days then it slowly got better. Didn&#39;t get vertigo and didn&#39;t get flushed after the vaccine. Didn&#39;t have the fainting feeling.

They called a rapid response and the patient was given epinephrine from an EpiPen.  She also took 50 milligrams of Benadryl p.o..  She then was transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation.    Upon arrival to the emergency department patient does not have recall of the events just after the injection, she states that she feels that her upper lip is swollen, her throat is swollen and she is short of breath.  She seems very anxious and jittery from the epinephrine.  Nursing reports that at the scene she was unable to talk, in the Emergency Department she is able to answer questions and speak full sentences.  She states that she feels somewhat better on arrival however is not back to baseline.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I felt abdominal pain and felt like I was going to get diarrhea and I got really flushed; shaky; face red. They put ice on back of neck. Arm started to hurt. Took Tylenol and sat down. And felt better 15 minutes later. Intervention was ice on back of neck so I wouldn&#39;t faint and rest. Overnight, first night - chills. Woke up with a headache. Took ibuprofen and Tylenol and had body ache and joint pain, too. Five days consistently (positionally) - when I laid down I would get it for five days. I had the vertigo which started 2 days after vaccine. Had a migraine 7 days after vaccine and I had to miss work because it was so severe. Had a typical migraine. Had an aura and it was so bad I couldn&#39;t see to drive to work. I don&#39;t ever get vertigo with my migraines and so this was different. After 7 days all symptoms were resolved. I am currently breastfeeding.

Today,  1/18/2020, I developed dark red blotches on my L hand, especially visible near the knuckles (the metacarpophalangeal joints). It then went away  within 3 minutes but then appeared on other parts of my hand, including on my  R hand. The blotches all went away within 2-3 minutes but occurred consecutively in different parts of my hand (i.e., some area developed the blotchiness prior to others, and then other parts developed it)

                                                On Tuesday, 11/19 about 10 pm, I started feeling some discomfort in my left breast.  The next morning, I was fatigued, had a headache, and woke up with an elevated basal body temperature (I&#39;m normally between 96.0 and 97.5 in the mornings, but ran at 98.2. Not a fever, but enough for me to think it was odd), and some discomfort in my left breast.  By the afternoon, part of my breast was red and warm to the touch.  My temperature was still in the normal range at 98.7 (I checked since I work in a hospital and wanted to make sure I reported any illness quickly).  I went to the ambulatory care center and was diagnosed with mastitis of the left breast and prescribed cephalexin 500 mg capsule QID x10.  After 7 doses, I am feeling better and the tenderness, discoloration, and warmth are gone.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

The arm pain got worse.  That night, I struggled to sleep.  The whole day after that, I had less malaise and the fever had gone down but the injection site reddened and grew even warmer and more tender.  That evening it was difficult to sleep as the soreness in my arm migrated to the shoulder, armpit and the right side of my chest, along where a bra band would go on the distal right side of the chest.  The next morning (today) the entire armpit area and upper distal right side of the chest were hot and tender.  This afternoon, I palpated the area and noticed at least one swollen lymph node.  My arm still hurts.

Within the first 15 hours following the injection I began experiencing extreme full body pain, neck, back, arms, legs, hands, and fingers. As well as experiencing a major headache equivalent to migraine pain. The pain was intense and lasted around 36 hours. Pain had subsided within 48 hours excluding pain at injection site that continued but was significantly milder.

I started experiencing injection arm soreness around 2100. By midnight I was experiencing chills and body aches. The morning of 1/27 my Temp was 100.0 and I was still having body aches and chills/feeling feverish. This continued throughout the day. I took one dose of Tylenol 1g and later ibuprofen 600mg. The morning of 1/28 I still had a mild headache and temp of 100.00 but overall was feeling much better - no more chills or body aches. My temp prior to going to work that night was 98.6 and my headache had resolved.

Developed low grade temp, flushed face, fatigue, muscle stiffness, body aches hours following vaccine. Aches and fatigue continues and it?s now day 8. The fatigue is constant but comes in waves. I?m taking unexpected naps which are abnormal for me. Caffeine and methylphenidate are ineffective. I?m still sore. I also have brain fog, maybe from the fatigue. I can?t think straight and it takes me longer to process and do tasks. I woke up 2 hours ago and I can?t wait to sleep again.

A 34-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high diagnosed a month before 18Jan2021 (Dec2020), she had no new medications though. There were no concomitant medications or recent vaccinations. The patient started experiencing an allergic reaction with hives up and down her body on unspecified date in Jan2021, so she sought care from her primary care provider (PCP) who prescribed her steroids (clarified to being prednisolone) methylprednisolone (lot number: 20C0087P, Expiry Date: Mar2022), she was taking 4mg doses as directed by the day, she was on third day of that medication; Benadryl, she had been taking 50mg every 4-6 hours by mouth; Zyrtec (lot number: 120026688, Expiry Date: Aug2022), she had been taking 10mg twice a day by mouth; and Pepcid (lot number: SMF084, Expiry Date: Jul2023), she had been taking 10mg once a day mouth. The reporter says her hives were all over her body: on her neck, arms, chest, back, buttocks, and down her legs. The event outcome was recovered on 18Jan2021, reported as the hives were gone. The only different thing she had recently was the vaccine, so she was concerned about getting the second dose on the 25Jan2021 and she was worried. The reporter said his wife sought help from her PCP along with another provider but they have no answers for them.  Information on the batch number has been requested.

                                                On Saturday morning I woke up with a headache and swollen lymph nodes in my neck/collarbone area. As the day progressed, I began to have pain in my joints and muscles. I felt very tired all day as well. I also experienced skin sensitivity which basically just made my skin hurt if anything/one touched me. Sunday my headache persisted, still had pain at injection site and felt warm to the touch. Swollen lymph nodes also still there and fatigue. Monday morning symptoms of headache, injection site pain and warmth and swollen lymph nodes still felt.  Taking Tylenol to help with headache, warm compresses to help swollen lymph nodes and ice pack for injection site pain.

                                                Received the vaccine, and was in the monitoring area.  Within ~5 minutes, I felt my throat was thickening.  I asked for water to see if that would help the sensation.  The sensation of thickness increased to a tightening and thickness and a very mild itchiness on the roof of my mouth.  I continued to feel a strong need to drink water and became extremely cold.  At about 20 minutes, my voice became hoarse.  I was given benadryl at approximately 40 minutes post injection, however the staff were communicating with people at the ER and was told that I needed an Epipen and to be transported immediately to the ER given signs of analphylaxis with the vocal change. I received the epipen about 45 minutes after injection, and a few minutes after receiving the shot, my throat felt looser. My voice continued to be hoarse. They had a very difficult time finding a vein in my arm for an IV (an I am typically very veiny).  I was transported to the ER, and given steriods and monitored.  At approximately 4 hrs post vaccine, I started to have worsening voice again, in which they gave me additional benadryl.  I continued to be monitored in the ER until 7 hrs post vaccine.  My voice continued to have moments where it was better and then it would go away again.  They offered to keep me for observation, however I declined and was discharged to home.  At home, later that night, I developed entire body itchiness, particularly over my face, and trunk.  This lasted for several days, with decreasing intensity.  My face was also very flushed looking lasting for 2 days after the reaction.  My voice returned to normal after 3 days.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I had chest discomfort followed by the sensation that there was ice around my heart, under my rib cage. The cold heart sensation lasted for roughly 20-30 minutes. Following the start of the cold heart sensation, I became dizzy, sweaty, lost peripheral vision, had numbness in my fourth and fifth fingers (ring and pinky fingers) in both hands, and vaccination site attendant mentioned my hands looked red. Dizziness and other symptoms lasted about 15-20 minutes. Now that over 24 hours have passed, my chest feels a bit tight when I breathe. Injection site is also sore.

                                                Received vaccine at 6:15pm on Friday night.  Approximately 30 minutes later, my face became very itchy and my face was covered in a red puffy rash.  At 8:00pm, I took 25 mg Benadryl. On Saturday, I still had the rash, so I took 3 doses of Benadryl over the course of the day to relieve the rash and itching.  The rash resolved Sunday.  On Saturday afternoon, I began to develop mild respiratory symptoms as well.  My chest became very tight. I took 30mg of prednisone at 4:00pm. This provided relief. The tight chest fully resolved Monday morning.

A 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on the left arm, on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included sinusitis, placenta accreta, infertility, caesarean section, seasonal allergy, sulfa allergy, and coriander allergy all from an unknown date. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone from an unspecified date. The patient previously took hydrocodone and experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL1284) on 30Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced left arm completely numb and tingling for 4 weeks. No other vaccines were given in four weeks. On an unspecified date after the second shot, it was reported that the patient experienced elevated BP of 166/99, nausea, heart palpitations HR 111, sweating, muscle cramps, swollen lymph nodes, dizzy, body weakness, fatigue, pain moving across the neck/chest/back, trouble sleeping, and pressure in chest. On 30Jan2021, 10 days after the second vaccination, the patient experienced splotchy skin. The events resulted in doctor clinic visit and emergency room care. The patient was given an unspecified treatment for the events. The patient was tested for COVID-19 post vaccination via nasal swab on 26Jan2021 with a negative result. The vaccine was administered in the workplace clinic. The outcome of the events were reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported elevated blood pressure cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

All of these symptoms started around 4:30PM. As of this report, headache, muscle weakness, and fatigue have resolved. Still have some neck tension (though that is common for me as I work at a computer), and injection site muscle pain is much improved but still noticeable when I move my arm or touch the site.

A 34-year-old female received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 28Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she had her vaccine last Thursday (28Jan2021) and believed she had an injection site reaction. She had severe soreness for 2 days and she had a half of the dollar size, coin size of bump and it&#39;s been red, swollen and itchy. She did not take anything for the events because she wanted to see how bad it goes. There was no Physician&#39;s Office/Emergency Room visit. She was curious if she will get the second dose since she had this first reaction. The outcome of the events was unknown.

After about 20 minutes my face and lips became numb, my cheeks turned red and hot to the touch, my face started to swell and it felt like my blood pressure dropped, I became dizzy. I took 50mg of Benadryl within 30 minutes of the initial onset of symptoms. All symptoms were gone within an hour of taking the benadryl. Over the next couple hours I experienced discomfort/soreness at the injection site and that tattoo on the same arm as the injection site became raised, hot and itchy. As of 3/3/2021 the only symptom remaining is the soreness at the injection site.

                                                First vaccine I could feel the vaccine go into my body and down into my legs. It was a very strange sensation. I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

                                                Soreness from the first night but 3 days later I noticed a large rash up my upper left arm around the injection sight. It is similar to a rash I got from a pneumonia vaccine last fall but I haven?t ever gotten a rash form a flu shot.

A 34-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Jan2021 13:00 (Lot Number: EL3246) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at age 34 years old. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. No concomitant medications. No other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (lot no: EJ1685) for COVID-19 immunization at 34 years old. After receiving the second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 08Jan2021, within 13 hours (09Jan2021 02:00) the patient was ill with flu like symptoms (woke up freezing, headache, neck pain, body aches, restless). Later that morning (09Jan2021), the patient had nausea, vomiting and fatigue. After 36 hours (09Jan2021), profound fatigue, intermittently dizzy, felt feverish but did not confirm; body aches had resolved. On 10Jan2021 01:00, slept most of the day and night, had a few scattered hives in the evening. On day 3 (11Jan2021), since this day the patient has had constant vertigo. She was hospitalized from 15Jan2021 to 16Jan2021, had extensive testing and saw different specialists, and was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis secondary to the vaccine. She never had CoVID before, healthy otherwise, and had negative CoVID antibody testing prior to receiving the vaccine. She was off work for 6 weeks, able to go back for 10 shifts but had worsening of vertigo symptoms and was unable to work x 3 weeks and ongoing; still working with vestibular rehab, still having daily significant vertigo. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, disability or permanent damage. Treatment received included medication and vestibular therapy. The patient underwent covid test (nasal swab) on 16Jan2021 with negative result. The patient recovered from body aches on an unspecified date in Jan2021; while not recovered from the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Tiredness has appeared to come and go over the last few days.  Every morning I have woken up with tingling in my left hand, as though there are pins and needles in my left hand.  My left arm feels weaker and feels some numbness when more pressure is placed on it.  I have a bruise that appeared above my left wrist.  I have reached out, as this is my employer and I have not heard back.  Assuming they were closed due to New Year?s Day.

                                                COVID-19 vaccination administered IM in left deltoid around 6am. Patient called pharmacy around 10am and complained that the injection was delivered too high and she was experiencing pain at the site. Vaccine placed high on L shoulder, just below acromion process, at or above humeral head. Seemingly placed between acromion process and humeral head, near or in soft tissue/bursa. Site pain is inflammatory in nature and does not seem to affect muscles, but instead is contained within joint itself.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 03Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 35-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma (no medication used), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and reflux, headaches, and COVID-19 (prior to vaccination). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications, taken within two weeks of vaccination, included pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PROTONIX), venlafaxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for headaches, curcuma longa (TURMERIC; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and probiotics (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced heart palpitations, elevated heart rate and blood pressure (BP), initially burning/tingly injection site, then back of throat/tongue/lips were tingly and numb feeling, then throat got hoarse on 03Jan2021 at 14:30. The events were reported as non-serious. The events required a visit to the emergency room. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included: BP: elevated and heart rate: elevated, both on 03Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, which included treatment with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL), and famotidine (PEPCID). The clinical outcome of heart palpitations, elevated heart rate and blood pressure (BP), initially burning/tingly injection site, then back of throat/tongue/lips were tingly and numb feeling, then throat got hoarse was recovering.

                                                I received my second vaccine on Friday 1/8. I felt fine until that evening and then experienced the typical side effects that I had read about. Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP and they said to call employee health.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded.

On 31Dec2020, the patient experienced Left Bell&#39;s palsy, numbness and paresthesia of tongue, left side of face, inability to raise left eyebrow, pain in left upper arm between elbow and shoulder, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure.  The adverse events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the adverse events which included Prednisone 20mg daily, Valacyclovir 1000mg twice a day. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the Bell&#39;s palsy and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  However, the Bell&#39;s palsy may possibly represent a concurrent medical condition.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including viral serologies, and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

There were no complications with the miscarriage.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

Also a red circle formed around (bigger that the bump), and the area is hardened and painful.   The person could not raise the arm either.  It last approximately 5 to 7 days to improve symptoms.   But still painful for approximately 3 weeks (at the time for the 2nd dose).    The situation repeated with 2nd dose in the other arm (will report separately).

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

Then I felt like I had been hit in the head with a bat, but the pain migrated from side to side in my head. It was a very strange feeling. The hot, tingly numbness lasted about 45 minutes to an hour, the headache began to subside after 2 hours. The next day I had a little raised redness and the injection site and a bad headache, but was otherwise fine. At the vaccination site they strongly advised I go to the ER, which I did. I have no history of vaccine reaction.

There was light headed sensation w/ movement and position, pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode and my eyes were burning.  Because so severe, I took 1000mg tylenol, lathered by entire body in eucalyptus oil and peppermint on my hands, I was able to fall asleep at 3am but it was restless sleep I kept waking up because any movement I made in bed I&#39;d have severe pain.  6am I felt moderately better all symptoms 50% improved, applied eucalyptus oil on again, started work at 730am I could barely function at work I have brain fog, just thinking focusing eyes concentrating makes migraine worse, &#43;photopphobia, phonophobia, just typing is very hard to do because it hurts my joints, the vertigo worsened and the slightest looking down to the keyboard while typing causes lightheaded sensation.  No improvement and it&#39;s now almost 1pm.  I didn&#39;t take any pain medication or apply any essential oils.

                                                I had a really sore arm for 4-5 days at the injection site.  I couldn&#39;t lift my injected arm over my head the next day after the injection due to stiffness and pain.  The pain improved over time.  I also had intermittent chills the evening after receiving the vaccine.  I had an episode of diaphoresis the next morning at work.  I checked my temperature when I was having chills and I had no fever.

My skin has since been very sensitive to touch, this includes skin on my face, arms, hands, and chest. I am very sensitive to temperature changes, especially cold. My nervous systems feels very sensitive, especially my hands. Touching cold items (refrigerator, outside, etc.) makes me shiver. I have also been experiencing a covid fog. I do not feel like myself and am not experiencing joy. I cry daily for no reason.

                                                I broke out in shingles; Relevant medical history: type 1 diabetes mellitus and lupus; Relevant medical history: type 1 diabetes mellitus and lupus; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient) via a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0142, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 08Jan2021 at 11:00 to 11:45 (as reported), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, in the hospital. Medical history included ongoing type 1 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed at 8 years old, maybe around 1993-1994), lupus from 2004 and ongoing, TTP (blood clotting disorder) from 2019 and ongoing and allergies to sulfa drugs. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu shot for immunization which she believes that was well before 4 weeks. The patient stated, &#39;My doctor wanted me to call and get information. I received my first vaccine but a week later I broke out in shingles and I&#39;m due to get my second dose in a week or so. Any advice on that? My doctor suggesting putting the second dose off for a few weeks. Does it become ineffective? Is there a timeline? What is the timing of the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and can I receive it earlier or later than 3 weeks?&#34;. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine. A week after, she came down with shingles. She was wondering if she could get the second dose after coming down with shingles. She clarified that on 15Jan2021 (Friday), she went with what she initially thought was a pinched nerve. She had radiating pain starting from her shoulder coming down into her hands and fingers. She had the rash probably on Friday (22Jan2021). She then started getting a small blister/rash on 23Jan2021. On 24Jan2021, she returned to the Urgent Care and the rash had spread at that point and they were pretty sure it was the shingles virus. She reported she had gone to Urgent Care over the weekend twice, they suspected that was what it was. She saw the doctor on 19Jan2021 (yesterday) and gave the official diagnosis of shingles. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I got the shot on a Friday night at 5pm. I experience the arm pain in my left arm through out the top of my arm , by the end of  that night. By Saturday evening most of the pain was gone from that site. Late Saturday night I started noticing some pain in the arm pit on the left arm, didn&#39;t think much about it. By Sunday mid morning the pain was just getting more severe. Started to pay close attention to the side effects of the vaccine to realize that I most likely had swollen lymph nodes. The pain continued through the following Wednesday, when the pain started to not be as bad. I still to this day have some pain in the lymph nodes. I have contacted my doctor and was told to just monitor the site to make sure nothing is worse. That these reactions are common. I also have some soreness in my upper arm under where the shot was given, that I&#39;m not sure if it is from the shot or the muscle compensating from the soreness of the swollen lymph nodes.

Later that evening my injection site was sore, itchy, and raised, like a hive.  On 2/23/21 I woke up at about 7:30AM and the injection site was the same as before, but I also had a sore/stiff neck and headache at the base of my skull.  The reactions have not warranted a trip to the doctor, but I remember hearing somewhere that the CDC was interested to know about any side effects that may be related to the vaccine.

                                                3 days after the first dose was received, rashes developed under my chin and necks area with itching, and stinging sensation.  The symptoms went away a couple days later.  The same symptoms would appear a couple more times spacing out about 2- 3 weeks after the initial reaction.  Then on 2/17/2021, the same symptoms appear again but this time it would spread out to my entire neck and also my face. Symptoms included facial swelling, redness, blisters, along with stinging, burning, and itching sensation.  I did not crossed my mind that it was a reaction, but come to think of it, all of these happened after the vaccinations.  I did seek medical treatment on 2/18/21 and was treated with steroid pack. Although the medication treatment regime had completed, I still have symptoms of itchiness under my chin and neck as well as the rashes are still visible.

Unable to grasp and tighten fist with grip weakness. Only on that hand and that specific knuckle. Treated with Tylenol 1000 mg, ibuprofen 400 to 600 mg, and benadryl 25 mg, and zyrtec 10 mg for 3 to 4 days after symptom onset. Returned to normal function in about 10 days. After second dose of Pfizer symptoms did not really develop immediately but noticed 3 weeks after symptoms returned. The symptoms seem to come and go and do not know if they have fully resolved yet.

I was taken to the ER and was administed benedryl.  I was transported to the hospital via ambulance because my mouth and throat was extremely dry and my voice got hardened.  During the ride I regurgiatated because my stomach got queezy and was administered Zofran.  My right hand turned completely white and I was administered another med to help turn my hand back right.  My baby was checked and she was fine and was released after about 3 hrs.  At that time I was 31 week gestation.  Until about 3 days ago my body was still very very itchy all over which seemed to worsen when I was sleep.

A 35-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in left deltoid at age 35 years on 23Mar2021 16:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EP7533) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization (prevention). Medical history included none. Family history of sister that had COVID and then got vaccine. She did not get a rash but is prone to allergies and things like that. Her sister has very sensitive skin and she does get rashes. Her sister got really sick but did not have the things she had. Her sister had COVID pretty bad for a week or 2. Once her sister was COVID negative, she got the first COVID vaccine and did ok. her sister got the second vaccine and got pretty sick like she had COVID again. Patient did not ever get COVID though. There were no concomitant medications.  No vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect and no vaccines administered within 4 weeks. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine given on 28Feb2021 at age 35 years, Injected intramuscularly in left deltoid, Lot number: EN6205, expiration date unknown and just had a sore arm after injection, mild discomfort in arm. Patient would like to report an adverse reaction that may be related. Patient got the second vaccine on 23Mar2021 16:30 (Tuesday), and on Thursday afternoon (25Mar2021), she broke out in a rash like hives, pretty much all over her body. Rash and hives all over body was reported as worsened. There was no prescriber for vaccine. She just received it as a part of an initiative. This is a delayed reaction after 38-42 hours or after 48 hours. It was not near the vaccination site. It is all over her torso, legs, thighs and looks like hives. She said &#34;hives in general if in an immuno response to BENADRYL or steroid cream&#34;. Patient stated event was medically significant. It is very uncomfortable. She doesn&#39;t normally get rashes and this was a new experience for her. Patient had labs done on an unspecified date for a physical and they were all within normal limits, such as her CBC, and CMP. She even got a C-Reactive protein and it was within normal limits. She has not left the house and has not changed detergents and has not done anything different that would cause this reaction. She wanted to know if there have been other delayed reactions like this.  She also mentioned taking amoxicillin antibiotics (Lot SM8720051-A, Expiration Mar2022. Dose was 875/125 1 tablet by mouth twice daily) for a sinus infection on unspecified date, and was on the last day and does not know if it would be clinically significant. Outcome of the events &#39;rash and hives all over her body, not only on the injection site/all over her torso, legs, thighs and looks like hives&#39; and &#39;delayed reaction after 38-42 hours or after 48 hours&#39; was not recovered, for the other events, it was unknown. Relatedness of drug to reaction(s)/event(s): Reaction assessed: Rash and hives all over body, Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection, Drug result: Related. Reporter seriousness for Rash and hives all over body: Medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                I started with a fever, chills and just general flu like symptoms that started the day of my 2nd vaccination(3/25/21) all which I knew I may experience. These started around 9pm on Thursday evening, and subsided by 6pm on Friday 3/26/21. On Saturday 3/27/21 I started to feel pain in my lower back. It wasn?t pain in the muscles it was itching of the skin that turned into a piercing pain that covered my lower back. I contacted my primary care and she said it sounded like shingles and asked if I had a rash. I did not. She started me on Gabapentin 300mg 1 capsule by mouth 3x a day as needed for pain. The symptoms lasted until approximately the evening of Tuesday 3/30/21. No rash ever appeared but the burning/itching/piercing pain is what stayed with me for those 3 days.

A 35-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: ER8734) at single dose on 06Apr2021 12:00 in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia; asthma (controlled). Patient had known allergies to CT contrast and codeine (when taken with albuterol). Concomitant medications in two weeks included pregabalin (LYRICA), baclofen, nortriptyline, vitamin D3. There was no other vaccine in four weeks. Patient got the shot and felt a little tingly and sat down for 15 mins and could not stand up because she was too dizzy. Her daughter (also there receiving the shot) grabbed paramedics to check if this was common. The paramedics helped walk her to their triage room set up maybe 50 yards away. By the time they got there, patient was breaking out in hives on her face and chest. The paramedics started setting up an IV and that was when her throat started closing. Patient was given a shot of EPI while they finished the IV and gave her a bunch of other things in the IV. Patient got another shot of EPI in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and was put on an EPI drip while admitted. Patient stayed in the hospital while they tried several times to take her off EPI, but was not successful until the end of the third day (Thursday night) when she was sent home. Patient returned to hospital Monday and currently still under medical care at home. All adverse events start date was 06Apr2021 12:00. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The seriousness criteria was hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Patient was hospitalized 3 days for the events, treatment included medication intervention. There was no covid prior vaccination, covid was tested post vaccination. Novel corona virus test via nasal swab on 13Jun2020 and 22Jun2020 were both negative; COVID-19 RT PCR via nasal swab on 21Jan2021 was negative. The outcome of events was recovering.

                                                Injection received at 0815. At 0900 I started getting diaphoretic, clammy, nauseas and my face was flushed. At 0930, I developed hives on my neck, chest and arms. I immediately went back to the vaccination site (I was still in the hospital at work) and was administered 25mg oral Benadryl and monitored for 30 minutes. The hives resolved, but I still felt unwell. At 1600 I noticed a swelling in my right upper thigh about the size of my hand. It was about 2 inches inferior to my inguinal crease and was the width of my thigh. It was mildly painful to the touch. My injection site was red, inflamed and itchy. I continued taking 25-50mg Benadryl Q4  and took 100 mg at night due to itchiness on my eyes, face, neck, chest and arms. This is still present, although less each day, as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I have felt feverish but have not had a recorded fever. I took some Ibuprofen for the pain in my arm at the injection site. The redness, swelling and itchiness has decreased each day at the injection site, but is also still present as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I still feel unwell and have continued diarrhea throughout the weekend.

The joint pain and numbness has faded but I am left with severe muscle soreness, like I was in a car accident. Oh and I lost taste sometime today. Also I had injection site pain for both doses, starting the morning after.

Felt slightly light-headed. Drank water and ate some food to closely monitor.  Very sore Left deltoid starting about 8 PM on 12/31/20 (same day as the vaccine administration).  It was so sore that it woke me up a few times at night and 1/1/21 I had to take Ibuprofen 400 mg to alleviate the pain. Had a dull headache all day 1/1/21 and very tired. Slept that night from 9 pm - 8 am next day.  No symptoms since 1/3/21.

I self administered 8 puffs of albuterol (my prescription) and took 50 mg of oral Benadryl with improvement in wheezing and swelling at injection site. I continue with some mild unilateral right upper eyelid swelling but much improved.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EJ1685) intramuscular at arm left, on 19Dec2020 06:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing acne. Patient had no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication included isotretinoin (ACCUTANE). On 19Dec2020 11:30, approximate 5 hours after vaccine, the patient experienced pain, joint pain and tenderness at injection site, progressively loss of strength and eventually inability to move arm. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL1284, expiry date not provided) on 23Dec2020 09:15 intramuscularly in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as preventive). There was no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The nurse (patient) received her first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at the hospital that she worked at. She was kept there for 15 min for monitoring and she felt fine. About 30 minutes post vaccination she got a hot flash, a flush over her face, she does not know if she was red but she felt flush. Her tongue felt strange, nothing swelled that she could tell, it felt hard to swallow, to make the motion to swallow it felt kind of sluggish. She felt weird swallowing which lasted for only a few minutes. She never struggled to breathe. She went back to park in the hospital parking lot since she was not sure if she was experiencing a anaphylactic reaction and then after a few minutes it went away. Her arm was sore and heavy feeling for that day. She had drowsiness for a couple of hours and pain and redness at the injection site for a couple of days that was not bothersome, it was mild. No relevant test. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine due to the symptoms she had after the first dose. The pain and redness at injection site was resolved on an unspecified date in Dec2020, while the other events were resolved on 23Dec2020.  The reporting nurse considered the events hot flash, flush all over her face, arm was sore and heavy, drowsiness, pain and redness at injection site were non-serious, while the events &#34;tongue felt strange, it was sluggish to swallow&#34; were serious that she drove back to the hospital (no emergency room/phycian office visit). She considered the events were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162Bw on the reported events cannot be excluded.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 from Mar2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced body aches, dry mouth, can&#39;t sleep, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and pain at the injection site, temp was 38.1 Celsius, head feels weird in Jan2021. The patient got her first dose and was looking online to see the symptoms. She said that she saw that during the trials, people were experiencing the symptoms she was experiencing after the second dose and she was concerned. She said that she wanted to make sure her symptoms are ok and to make sure that the symptoms are not just caused from the booster, but also from the first dose. The caller said that her mom told her that someone died from the Pfizer vaccine. No further details provided. The patient was having body aches, could not sleep, her mouth is really dry, her temp was 38.1 Celsius, her head feels weird, she has generalized weakness, pain at the injection site, and decreased appetite. She said that it was like having Covid again. She said that she had Covid back in Mar2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 38.1 centigrade.  The outcome of all the events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the suspected COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

A 36-year-old-female patient (non-pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 06Jan2021 at 08:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergies to gluten and penicillin (PCN). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took cefaclor (CECLOR) and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the patient&#39;s workplace clinic. The first dose was given at 08:30 on 06Jan2021. A few minutes after, the patient became dizzy and lightheaded for what seemed like a minute or two and then she was fine for the remainder of her 15-minute observation. Around 17:00 that day, the patient became itchy on her right arm and upper right torso area, no rash or swelling was noted. Itching subsided around 20:00 - almost 12 hours post-vaccine. The events were considered non-serious. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from the events on 06Jan2021 (&#34;Itchy on her right arm and upper right torso area&#34; at 20:00).

                                                My first dose of COVID vaccine I didn&#39;t have any symptoms (1st dose: 12/23/20). Received 2nd dose at 0800 on 1/12/21. First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

Horrible headache that did improve with tylenol and ibuprofen taken at the same time. Body shakes and can&#39;t control body temperature.  Felt freezing cold but skin was very hot to the touch (according to my husband). Then, I started sweating and felt really hot and couldn&#39;t cool down.  Felt nauseous but no vomiting.    Could not sleep but felt very tired.  Today is now 48 hours after vaccine and body aches are gone but I am still extremely fatigued.

She complained of feeling very hot and with mental confusion. We administered 50 mg of diphenhydramine, and 15 minutes later sent her to the ED. At the ED they diagnosed her with a minor anaphylaxis reaction, gave her methylprednisolone and epinephrine.

Then throughout the night symptoms worsened with significant body chills despite multiple layers, severe body pain and migraine trigger. In the morning felt like full-blown flu with fever of &gt; 100 F, sensitive skin painful to the touch, cold sweats, full body pains, heart palpitations (pounding heart beats and ave 100-120 bpm), and migraine level 8/10. Medication required to try to treat symptoms (metoclopramide, claritin, excedrin). Symptoms continued and did not start to lessen until approximately 30 hours post vaccine dose (18 hours post severe symptom initiation) and two doses of medication regimens. Arm around injection site also showed raised, red irritation local to the site, however, was not exacerbated throughout the symptom course. COVID call center recommended for me to see emergency care facility due to symptoms which I waited to see if symptoms worsened before deciding to not go to the urgent care center.

                                                I received the Covid-19 vaccine on 01/20/2021 and had tingling/slight numbness in my left arm (injection arm). Later in the evening I had the same feeling in my left leg and in my cheeks, lips, tongue and teeth. I felt like I had been numbed at the dentist, but was coming out of the numbness. It was like when the numbness is mostly gone and you&#39;re left with that tingling sensation, and your face feels puffy. It was basically that feeling in my face, left leg, and left arm. Those sensations are mostly gone today (the second day following), but not quite.

                                                I received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday, January 20th at 1:15 PM. After I got the vaccine, I went in to the observation tent for observation. I sat down and immediately felt a tingle sensation in my fingers on my left hand and my arm hurt at the injection site on my left arm. After I left the observation and returned home, the rest of the day/night, my left arm hurt where I received the shot, I had a headache, my neck hurt, and I felt a little nauseous. The next day, January 21st, I felt a slight tingle sensation in both my hands and feet on my left and right side. January 22nd, the slight tingle sensation in both hands and feet on my left and right side continued, and I had a very bad headache. The slight tingle sensation has continued along with some muscle soreness in my arms and legs. The tingle sensation is intermittent throughout the day in my fingers and toes. I have no numbness and it is not painful. It is just a slight minor tingle sensation. I messaged my doctor on January 25th and was advised to monitor it and contact back if it doesn&#39;t go away. Present day January 30th, I still have slight tingling sensation in my fingers and toes on my left and right side, the muscle soreness has since subsided.

I have a lot of medicinal allergies and this is my normal response when I have a reaction. The itching gradually got worse and some swelling started as well. Around 1:45pm my throat started swelling and I was having trouble swallowing. This continued to get worse, so I stopped at the ER on my way home. I was given Benadryl in an IV and observed for 2 hours. The swelling in my throat went down by 2:45, but the itchiness continued until around 5pm. That evening, the only symptom left was fatigue.

A 36-year-old female patient  received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), intramuscular in left arm on 12Jan2021 11:00 to at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was done in a hospital. There were no relevant medical history and concomitant medications. On 12Jan2021 11:00, hives from the neck to legs, face redness and tightness in the chest, and was unable to take a deep breathe. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae. The events resulted in an emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment for the events included Benadryl, Ativan, Pepcid, NS Bolus and EpiPen. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient was not tested with COVID-19 post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of hives from the neck to legs, face redness and tightness in the chest, and was unable to take a deep breathe due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including physical examination with vitals and chest x-ray, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Slept entire day. Appetite normal. Next day 2/5/2021 12:30p left house to travel to market and couldn?t remember how to get there, had to slowly return home. Called family member to make them aware as I tried to safely return home. Couldn?t immediately recount events or where exactly I was or where I had been. Writing this is increasingly confusing and taking longer than usual.

She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid.

A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

As such per the guidance I remained in the waiting room for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I had a light rash on both forearms and near the injection site on my left upper arm. I felt fine otherwise. I went up to the nurse in the monitoring room and showed her the rash. She asked if I was having trouble breathing. At the time I was not. She said I could take Benadryl for the rash as long as I had no allergy to Benadryl. I started driving home. During my drive my throat started to feel itchy and irritated. It proceeded to get worse and when I looked at my throat in the mirror it was very red and starting to be visibly swollen. I drove to the nearest hospital and checked myself in to the emergency room.

Nothing in the right armpit. I also had aggressive itching at the injection site and a hard area and red welt.

                                                I initially developed an erythematous, pruritic rash on the posterior neck, trunk, arms and distal legs. In the next 24 hours the rash improved on the trunk but became more severe on the extensor surfaces of the arms (mostly near the elbows), knees and shins, with a few lesions on the anterior trunk. The rash is pruritic and pruritus is minimally improved with Benadryl. The pruritus and erythema is most improved with NSAIDs or Prednisone. The rash has continued for 5 days (still present), the lesions have lightened and pruritus is controlled  with the use of daily Prednisone and PRN Ibuprofen 600-800mg but it is still present on the knees, shins and elbows. The appearance seems to be consistent with erythema nodosum, which I have not previously had. I have no prior history of allergic reactions to vaccines or history of delayed hypersensitivity reactions.

A 36-year-old non pregnant female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection) on 21Jan2021 (Lot number: El3249) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm at single doe for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical condition. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 31Dec2020 08:00 AM (Lot number: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and at 31Dec2020 12:00 PM experienced small rash on left side of chest. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient concomitant medication included Levothyroxine sodium (Euthyrox, Strength: 150ug) and Drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (Nikki, Strength: 3mg/0.02mg). After first shot developed small rash on left side of chest. Persisted for three weeks and was starting to fade when she got second dose. Grew 4-5 times larger, raised, painful, red itched and tender. Now reaches my neck and breasts and shoulders. White normal skin in center, edge was now scaly and dry, itches very badly. Dr won&#39;t prescribe steroid fears it will dampen immune response. Taking Allegra, Benadryl and hydrocortisone cream. Does not help. Never had a reaction to a vaccine before. The patient was underwent COVID-19 (Nasal Swab) and PCR at pharmacy (nasal swab) test (test twice weekly for work) both on 29Jan2021 which were negative. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                I initially had itchiness at injection site, then more of my arm. At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

                                                My symptom began with an itchy spot on my left forearm advancing to the back of my neck and head followed by a rash. The rash extended over my neck, chest, face, spreading to entire body. The left side of my lip also had swollen and became tingly. All symptoms started roughly at 3am on 3/4/21. I took ibuprofen 800mg along with Benadryl 25mg. At 0730am rash had dissipated some and most of the itching subsided, another Benadryl 25mg tablet was taken. At 1030am, rash had dissipated except still remaining on both elbow areas, non itching at this point. At 1230, another Benadryl was taken.

Approximately 15-20 minutes after dose was administered I began feeling a reaction. The skin on my face, neck, and chest became red, flushed, warm, splotchy, and itchy. My tongue and throat began to feel swollen/tight. I was also lightheaded and dizzy. My husband was driving the car and we almost returned to the vaccination site, but after approximately 5 more minutes, the tightness in my throat subsided, so we continued to go home. The flushing and lightheaded-ness went away after approximately 20 minutes. This is similar to the reactions I had just before I discontinued taking copaxone (approx. 2 years ago). I did not feel this way after dose one of the Pfizer COVID vaccine.

                                                I had my first COVID vaccine on 1/16/21. I had my second one on 2/5/21. On 2/9/21 I started experiencing a sharp pain in my left breast. On 2/10/21 I had sharp pain in between my shoulder blades. On 2/11/21 I noticed a small red rash-like spot in between my breast. I woke up on 2/12/21 in incredible pain on my back, so I lifted my shirt to look in the mirror and that is when I noticed a blister type rash from the middle of my back wrapping around the front of my body covering my left breast. I went to see the PA at my PCP&#39;s office. She diagnosed me with shingles. She placed me on an anti-viral medication for a week, and gabapentin (nerve medication) for a month. It has been 3 weeks today since I first began treatment and I have not fully recovered yet. My blisters dried up about a week ago, but ever since then I have been incredibly itchy, which has kept me up every night for over a week now. On 3/3/21 I called my PCP&#39;s office and they started me on Prednisone for 6 days. I am 2 days into treatment and I still have not had relief from the itching.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 06Apr2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3246) (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included topiramate (TOPAMAX) at 250 mg, daily (2 DF 100mg and 1 DF 50mg at bedtime) taken for migraine, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received fist dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 27Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that since the second vaccination experienced tachycardia, palpitation, shortness of breath and basically blasting of air, difficulty breathing, dizziness and weakness, all on 18Jan2021. She reported pulse keeps raising, elevating to 148-157, she had palpitation complications without doing anything straight away. Elevated pulse and tachycardia, that all started and that was very concerning, pulse went to 209 and that was when she got transported to the emergency room. The patient reported also syncope episodes, costochondritis and chest pain on Jan2021.  On 26Mar2021 the patient experienced having discoloration on her toes, numbness and tingling and that her extremities, from the knee down and both her hands and feet were cold, ice cold. The patient was transported to the hospital by ambulance three times due to the events (hospitalizations on 22Jan2021, 30Jan2021 and 25Mar2021). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Troponin, D dimer, electrocardiogram (EKG), Chest X ray, Full blood count (CBC), exercise electrocardiogram (TMT) all resulted: normal, nuclear stress test: unknown results and pulse 148-157, 209,  all on unspecified date. The patient outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the tachycardia and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This nurse reported for helf that the 37-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, product: COVID 19, brand: Pfizer), via an unspecified route of administration on Left Arm on 19Dec2020 10:30AM at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. No Pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included Known Allergies to medications, food, or other products:Cocoa butter. Concomitant medications were unknown. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was Hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that &#34;Starting seven hours after the vaccine, I experienced severe fever and chills. The next morning, despite multiple anti-pyretics, the fevers/chills were worse. Also I experienced severe night sweats, likely related to the fevers. Three days after the vaccine, I began to have hives throughout my body and a rash on my face. Responds to Benadryl, but eventually reappears.&#34; The event started from 19Dec2020 05:30 PM. Treatment was received for the adverse event included Anti-pyretics, anti-inflammatories, anti-histamine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Facility type vaccine was hospital. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient recovered with lasting effects. No Covid prior vaccination. No Covid tested post: vaccination. The outcome of the event was recovered/resolved with sequel in Dec2020.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events severe fever and chills, severe night sweats, and hives and a rash on face were likely related to the use of first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: mild asthma attack on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, moderate dyspnea on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, chest pressure on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, a 4-5 cm area of induration in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, mild erythema in her left deltoid area in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown. The patient had intermittent asthma with no attacks in the past six years. Two days after the vaccination, she had a mild asthma attack when she was walking up stairs. For the past two days, she has had multiple asthma attacks, with moderate dyspnea and chest pressure present for most of the day. The patient&#39;s symptoms have been improving with her as needed (PRN) salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. The physician saw the patient in a telemedicine visit and found her to have an asthma exacerbation; therefore, prednisone was prescribed. The patient had no symptoms of viral infection and reported testing negative for COVID-19 after the onset of her asthma symptoms. The physician suspected her asthma exacerbation to have been caused by the vaccine because she had been symptom-free in recent years and she has not had a new exposure other than the vaccine. In addition to her respiratory symptoms, the patient had a 4-5 cm area of induration and mild erythema in her left deltoid area; this appeared about 1 week after she received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild asthma attack, moderate dyspnea, chest pressure. The patient, since the vaccination, had been tested for COVID-19. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

At 0845, she came to me and reported that her shoulder was achy and the pain rated 4/10 was radiating to her back. I checked the injection site and arm and it was not red, raised, or warm. Pt did not have any other symptoms, just the achy shoulder. Pt also reported a brief burning sensation in her shoulder that subsided within 1 minute. She later felt that same sensation in her forearm and it also subsided. It was recommended that she go to the ED for monitoring since the pain was radiating further from her shoulder. ED RN took her in at 0905 and I left.

A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EH9899) via intramuscular on 19Dec2020 09:00 on left deltoid at a single dose for COVID-19 prophylaxis. The patient medical history, family history and relevant tests were reported as none. Current concomitant medications included multivitamin took 2 chewable gummies sporadically for years as supplementation therapy. The patient previously took Flu shots she got a sore arm. It was not bad. Tetanus gives her a sore arm, but that was all. Caller wanted to know what she should do for preparation to safely get second dose of Covid vaccine and how to fix what she was feeling right now, making sure it doesn&#39;t get worse, considering she is still having symptoms. Caller stated that she had side effects of tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat. The transferring agent stated that he has a caller on the line that was calling about the Covid-19 Vaccine and reported that the patient got the shot on the 19Dec2020 and was inquiring about to proceed with her weird side effects. Caller had not told her physician about her symptoms yet. Caller clarified that she said a half an hour after the dose on 19Dec2020 09:30 she said that she had a Globus sensation or like a lump in her throat. Caller also reported that the back of her tongue felt swollen. Caller said that the Globus sensation was intermittent and it was not as prominent now as it was. Caller said that it was medically significant, but she has not sought medical treatment yet. Caller said that she still had a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site. She said that the injection was high but reported that she did not have a lot of injection site pain, it very minimal. No emergency room or physician office required. The outcome of the event tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat was recovering and the outcome of the event a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site was not recovered and the outcome of the event minimal injection site pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible chronological association between vaccine administration and onset of the events. Causality cannot be completely excluded.

My eye started to hurt with pressure. The tingling in my arm and hand went away after 30 minutes or so but there was still some tingling of my face, toungue and the pressure of the eye still remained. That night I took a Zyrtec and felt better for a few days. on 1/8 I started to feel tinging in my tongue and pressure in my right eye again. I took Zyrtec that night and it went away. Currently this morning I feel okay and hope it wont come back.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after receiving the vaccine, I had a sore arm.  Then experienced aches in my hip and knee joints, hot sweats alternating with chills, I did not take my temperature.  I woke up the next morning with a headache and skin sensitivity.  I took ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol and started to feel better.  I felt back to normal about 36 hours after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Covid toes, red tender slightly swollen toes with mild purple discoloration at the tip of toes, developed 3 days after receiving the first vaccine dosage in the series.  I have tested negative for covid as of 1/10/21.  It was initially thought that I had a skin infection from clipping my nails too short and was prescribed doxyclycline. I saw an improvement within a few days on the antibiotic but them saw a reappearance of the covid toes presenting symptoms on 1/8/21. I have since been told by a physician that I likely have covid toes and not a bacterial infection. I was told to take baby asprin and that is helping to reduce the symptoms.   In the past few weeks I have had no symptoms of Covid besides the appearance of covid toes. I understand that covid toes are often a latent symptom and that the timing of the appearance of this symptom could be coincidental. I am mildly concerned that the first vaccine dosage could have caused a flair up of a potential previous covid infection or could have caused the red covid toes symptom itself.

                                                Following vaccination, I had a headache for few days along with some  pain on injection arm. The headache continued and soon some fatigue and tiredness accompanied it for 7-10 days following vaccination.  Then ten days after, I had an increase in symtpoms that included heightened fatigue, loss of appetite, feeling &#34;cold&#34;/ &#34;hot&#34; (no fever), and abdominal pain with nausea and some diarrhea.    Two weeks after vaccination, I had an increased of fatigue and not feeling well, accompained by a fever of (101.5 F) and chills, sore throat, and lethargy.  My symptoms of fever, chills, sore throat, body aches, congestion, and fatigue remained over the next few days and soon included chest pain and some increase work of breath.  With two negative Covid tests through work, it was recommended I go to see a physician, who instead sent me to Immediate Care.  There I had an EKG which showed sinus bradycardia and they sent me to ER due to my symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath.   At the ER, multiple tests were run to negative results.  ER Physician suspects that some of my struggles could be related to Covid vaccine but that I also may have caught an non-Covid virus on top of it which led to acute bronchitis.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

                                                At 2000 on 1/13/21, I started to experience intense ache at the injection site, which by 2200 progressed to myalgias in my back, especially lower back, neck, and right arm. At 2300,  I started to have fever/chills, up to 39 C orally. This only partially responded to Tylenol. I was not able to sleep.  At 2:30 am I noticed an unusual headache, 8/10, as well as bilateral eye pain on Moving eyes side to side as well as sensitivity to light. Headache was mostly frontal, which came and went every few minutes  until exactly 11:38 am on 1/14/2021, when the fever and myalgias very suddenly got significantly better. Almost exactly 24 hrs to the minute after injection. On 1/15/2021, I still have significant pain in my left arm, swelling, redness and, now, itching at the injection site. My lower back still hurts.

She had red blotches all over her neck and chest. She said her throat was tight. She was able to swallow the water she requested. I gave her 50mg of benadryl.  She had no visible signs of being unable to breathe. I explained to her we could call 911. She reported she had no insurance. She said she was on her lunch break at the hospital and wanted to get back. She did walk back across the street unassisted. Clinical observer, followed her over just to verify she made it in the building. She ended up checking herself into the ER instead of returning to her shift.

I have tried Benadryl and Pepcid to see if it was a histamine reaction that I could stop. Also I now have a psoriatic arthritis flare and my plaque psoriasis is not being managed by topical treatments. The rash started at about day 5 and continues presently. The injection site was indurated and tender x 14 days.

A 37-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ek5730), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 28Dec2020 12:00PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at hospital facility. Medical history included Hashimotos disease. The patient had no known allergies and has not had COVID prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she felt tired and confused and unwell on day of injection, 28Dec2020. After three days (31Dec2020), she developed hives on her stomach and arm and seven days later (04Jan2021), she was diagnosed with pneumonia and continued to have hives all over her legs and arms to this day. The patient was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She underwent Covid test/ Nasal swab post vaccination on 09Jan2021, pending result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported pneumonia was more likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

It slowly began to progress to my legs, torso, and feet by 8:30pm.  The rash was raised, hot, and red. Blanchable to touch and extremely itchy.  I used Benadryl 50mg (taken at 8:45pm) and hydrocortisone cream to alleviate the rash. This helped until  Monday 1-18-21 at 06:00am. The rash began to return so I took another  50mg of Benadryl. The rash again cleared until 10:00am, at which point I scheduled a virtual visit through portal. I was prescribed prednisone and Famotidine. The rash continues to reappear once the Benadryl has worn off.  Today I have taken one dose of  prednisone and  a total of 3 doses of Benadryl.

                                                Symptoms reported by patient  Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 @ 0950.  Vaccine was given on side of left arm.  On the evening of 1/5 I started to not feel well.  I had a runny nose, headache, nausea, and fatigue.  The injection site on my left arm was red, warm, and swollen with a knot/ball that could be felt underneath.  I also had moderate pain at injection site.  This was about the size of a half dollar.  On the morning of 1/6 I still didn&#39;t feel well.  I received a call from my mom that she tested positive for COVID and although I did not have much contact with her there was one day on 12/26 that I saw her outside for about 15 minutes (masked).  I called employee health with all of this as it was hard to separate the exposure from symptoms of the vaccine.   I did express some concerns over having a vaccine reaction but was told the symptoms I was having would be normal.  I was tested for COVID, which was negative.  Over the next few days symptoms got better but I did have nausea on and off until the morning of 1/11.  Redness at injection site, swelling and pain were resolved by 1/11 as well.  On Friday 1/15 I woke up and my injection site was red, warm, swollen, and had pain again.  This was about the size of a quarter.  There was also a hard area that could be felt under the skin.  My arm hurt with radiating pain into my wrist.  I thought maybe it was just random and it would go away.  It slowly resolved through out the day and was mostly gone by Saturday 1/16/21.  The only thing left was a faded red area about the size of a nickel.  Friday evening ,1/15, I started to not feel well with body aches, joint pain, headache, and pain from injection site that radiated to my chest (this was intermittent).  I also had a low grade fever (highest temp 99.9).  I still did not feel well on Sunday but some symptoms were improved (pain radiating to chest was better and no more fever) but still had fatigue and body aches.  I had a rapid COVID test done which was negative on the evening of 1/17/21.  On 1/18 I felt better but towards the end of the day started to feel fatigued with body aches and headache.  I contacted employee health for further follow-up.

                                                I first had a typical reaction to the vaccine, including soreness at site, fatigue, aches, and chills. On the fourth day after the shot, I developed shingles on my left side (the same side as where I received the vaccine). It began on the left side of my scalp and progressed down my forehead and to my left eye. My left eye also became very swollen, to the point of being shut.   I am 12 days post vaccine now, and I still have shingles and my eye is still very swollen. I have been seen at both the ER and urgent care. I am currently taking Valtrex, oral steroids, and have antibiotic ointment for my eye as well as steroid eye drops.

It progressively worsened and grew to up my side/chest to my armpit. It felt swollen and very sore and lasted about 48 hours. I googled the side effect and didn&#39;t seek medical attention.

A 37-year-old female patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9261, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm right) on 21Jan2021 10:45 given to protect against the virus (COVID-19 immunisation). Vaccination Facility Type: Hospital. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. Medical history included immediate, severe allergic reaction penicillin when she was a kid and she hadn&#39;t had it since. The patient had no other medical history and family medical history relevant to adverse event. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had no other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. The patient was looking for guidance about getting the second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine. Had the first dose on 21Jan2021 (Thursday) and had no reaction until 24Jan2021, 3 days later (Sunday). That night she developed what she believed waas hives, an itchy rash on her upper arm of the injection site that spread across her shoulder and both her chest and back and there was also a rash at the bottom of her neck. The hives were still there the day of reporting and been there since.  Patient heard that when you have a severe allergic reaction to medicines in past it could be an indication. States she was not seen at the emergency room or at the doctor&#39;s office, she only called the doctor&#39;s office. They recommended her not to get the second dose, but she wanted to be sure and wanted more information. Relevant tests were not done. Patient would like to know if she should get the second dose of the covid vaccine after the reaction she experienced post 1st dose. The outcome of events was not recovered (ongoing).

I also had swelling in my fingers really bad on the same hand of the arm I got the vaccine.  Other side effects were headache, body aches, and a little bit of chills but those were expected.  I reached out to my PCP and she said to just monitor it to make sure it goes down in the next few days which I plan to do.

I waited and it progressively got worse. it felt like I had phlegm stuck in my throat that I could not get out. nurses at the drive offered to call 911 but I was close enough to an Urgent care/ER that I decided to drive myself over there. they took me in, started an IV and gave me 50mg of epinephrine and Benadryl, steroids and Pepcid. they prescribed an EpiPen. They told me to continue taking Benadryl because the allergic reaction could resurface. cough is still present and I have body aches.

We were at a drive through clinic waiting the 15 minutes in the parking lot before leaving and had the paramedic from the ambulance come look. I leaned into the seat to let my husband photograph my dots, and where my shoulder was leaning into the seat, I immediately had a smattering of red pin prick dots. They began showing on my left arm. We were advised to go to the ER. My hemoglobin was fine (though clotting factors were off), and he?d see a few reactions like that, so we were sent home.   I had diarrhea, abdominal pain, and severe nausea, but nothing scary or bad.   I woke to not being able to urinate, and that was followed with complete incontinence. I cannot control my bladder at all, cannot urinate on demand, and often don?t realize I?m urinating until I feel the warm gush.

Then my chest and back became itchy. At about 18 minutes after the shot I started having trouble breathing, my throat felt like it was closing and I had a terrible cough. Given two Epi shots about 10 minutes apart, ER gave me breathing treatments and other meds via an IV and shots (I don&#39;t know what, I was a little out of it).

Next, I was feeling tingling in my extremities. Then like the flick of a switch, I went into anaphylactic shock. I couldn&#39;t breathe and struggled to get the words out to get an epi pen. I was then injected with 3 epi pens while the ambulance was called. I also felt tingling in my tongue and mouth. The following day at home, I had another reaction. It started with tingling in my throat then the shallow breathing again. Chest pains again, then anaphylactic shock again. The next day, allergy symptoms came back, but not anaphylactic shock. This time, the addition of burning in my biceps on both sides, which traveled down to my forearms. Later on, the burning traveled down my torso to my legs. There is also some burning in my ears and scalp. My breathing is shallow, and it seems like when the allergy meds start to wear off, the symptoms keep coming back. They&#39;re happening now as I write this

                                                I first got a bad headache and dizzy. They brought me back behind a curtain with an emergency person. I got very dizzy and nauseous after that. They had me lay down on a cot. About 30 minutes after I received the vaccine, they brought me out to my husband?s vehicle in a wheelchair. By that time, I was so dizzy that I could hardly stand by myself. I was told to call my primary care doctor. My husband called them while we were headed home. My tongue was swollen a little. We decided to go to my father in law?s home, since he is a doctor. By the time we got there, I was coughing. We were still on hold for a nurse at my primary care doctor?s office. I started getting hives on my chest and neck and wheezing around the same time. We left before seeing my father in law to go home and use my nebulizer. For the moment, I used my inhaler, which doesn?t work as well. Once we got to my driveway, a nurse from my PCP office said to go straight to the emergency room. I spent the night at the hospital that night and was treated for an allergic reaction, which resolved the issues. I continued medications at home after leaving the hospital the following day.

In about 10 min I felt very hot in my face, back and felt like I was going to pass out. My heart was racing, it was about 130. My BP initially was 139 and then 160 after that. I never passed out but I felt those waves with a tingling to my face and my neck as I was going to pass out and I started shaking and my heart was racing and my BP was up and it lasted about 45 min before it started going down.  They gave me some Ibuprofen at the Employee health and they kept observing me and it started getting better after 45 min. I still felt the waves of feeling flush and hot and cold and very fatigued.

A contactable 38-year-old female Nurse (patient)  reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021) at single dose since 22Dec2020.  Relevant history and concomitant drug was none. The patient excepted Covid 19 vaccine could decrease the chance of contacting Covid 19 virus, while she stated she was getting a red patchy hives and itchy waves of red rashes all over the body just after received the vaccine. The patient (nurse) stated, &#34;I would if I can explain a little more, the day after I received the Covid vaccine I had noticed a big like what I would explain it like a red hives, like a raised red rash on my left hip it last like a day its subsided and next morning I woke up and I had a different flares that was the same on my other side of my body again went away. After a day when I woke up and I had two new spot on my knee that was the other thing, those went away on that day. This morning I woke up and I had another one on my shoulder and on my lower back. I am also thinking I am getting one may be on my ear like I said they pop up and they itch a little and they go away. I never ever experienced anything like it and I see the only thing that I have changed in my life or regimen or added to my body so I just wanted to make sure it was reported. I am nervous and curious if it is a potential side effect added if I should be careful before getting second one all those things.&#34;  No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of events was unknown. When probed for the Causality, the nurse stated, &#34;I have no idea, if it is something going on with me that is completely unrelated its just occurred right after I got the vaccine so I have no idea if this is a separate issue or not. I going to see dermatologist and physician but until then I just thought to report it to you all to see if anybody is experiencing this and to know if it is safe to go for second dose.&#34;

                                                itching; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reported for herself. A 38-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231 and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm deltoid on 28Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included Gallbladder removal from 2019 to 2019, asthma but grew out of it which the last time she had an attack was when she was 12 years old, C-sections for her kids. The patient concomitant medications reported as none. The patient was got the COVID vaccine, the first shot and she experienced itching that&#39;s why she took the Benadryl 50 mg. She didn&#39;t know if that was normal for people who had the covid vaccine to experience this. The vaccine was received on Monday, 28Dec2020 and the itching started Tuesday on 29Dec2020. She was ok on Wednesday 30Dec2020 but today she is itching again. She took Benadryl 50mg the day the itching started, just once and the next day she was fine. It is explained that the itching was not severe and she was not scratching her skin, she just feel itchy like something was crawling on her skin. She has no known allergies but does remember when C sections had for her kids, she had severe itching with the epidural, she experienced this with but it happens every time she gets an epidural. She has had no adverse events or allergic reactions to any other vaccines. The vaccine was administered on the right upper arm deltoid. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                7 days after my first Pfizer COVID vaccine, I developed mastitis. It began in the morning with mild generalized muscle and joint pain and progressed to moderate to severe joint pain, a fever of 102 degrees, and localized redness and swelling of the left breast over the course of 12 hours. Treatment with Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 14 days was initiated within 12 hours of onset. The systemic symptoms resolved within 24 hours of treatment onset and the breast redness and swelling resolved within 72 hours.   While I am aware that an infectious mastitis is likely unrelated to the vaccine, I opted to report this incident because I have breastfed 3 children and have never had mastitis prior to this event  and because of the limited information available on this vaccine in lactating women.

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

I fell asleep. I woke up around 0200 on 1/13/21 with extreme muscle and joint aches, a sensation of pins, needles, and tingling all over my body I felt very jittery and was actually shaking slightly throughout the ordeal. I felt like my nervous system was overloaded and my perception of pain was extremely heightened. At one point during this 4 hour period I had a visual hallucination.

Palpable lymph node along left clavicle with similar fluid filled swelling. Took motrin throughout the day and 50 mg of benadryl at bedtime. 1/13: Left arm pit still swollen. more tender with movement. While at work i put hot compress in my arm pit to help with the pain and shortly after i noticed my left arm had bright red streaks from my arm pit to my wrist. It also was very mottled looking. My arm felt tight/heavy  or kind of like a pinched nerve feeling.. I took motrin throughout the day for soreness and took benadryl at bedtime. I place ice pack under my arm during the evening as well.  1/14: Swelling remains in the armpit. Tenderness is getting better. Similar swelling around clavicle . Still taking motrin for inflammation and using ice pack under my arm.

                                                Approximately 28 hours after injection I started experiencing intermittent numbness and tingling in the right hand. At 33 hours post injection developed a deep dull aching pain throughout entire right arm. This worsened, and after 2 more hours intermittent sharp shooting pain down the arm. Pain rated 6 out of 10 intermittently with a constant 3 out of 10 full ache.  Difficulty falling asleep due to discomfort and at one point the pain woke me up from sleep. It was resolving by early the next morning, and disappeared by hour 48 post injection. These pains were not inclusive of the soreness and tenderness of the injection site or the muscle pain when lifting the arm. Those symptoms are still present to a minimal extent 54 hours after injection, at the time I am writing this report.

                                                The day after I had the shot, i started to itch on my left arm , around the area I had the shot,,and then it developed into a rash like situation on both arms...the itching was so intense and then i noticed tiny bumps  and black and blue spots along my right and left arm.  It then spread to my thighs and upper chest area. I also had tightness in my throat and i took some Benadryll over the weekend hoping it would go away but it didn&#39;t. It got worse. On Monday, it was swollen on both arms and looked more like hives, red itchy with tiny bumps. On Tuesday, I went to my PCP who indicated it may have been an allergic reaction from the vaccine. She gave me Medrol and that is what I have been taking. Today the itching is a little less intense ..

A 38-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer -BioNTech, Lot# EL0140), intramuscular in left arm, on 08Jan2021 at 14:00, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism (diagnosed about 25 years before) and COVID-19 from Oct2020 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced hives on 10Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered; rash on her neck, largely on her chest across both breasts and some going down her belly, near her belly button and upper back on 10Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered. The events did nor require emergency room visit or physician office visit. The reporter considered the events as non serious, stated they were not interfering, not causing any issues. The reporter also stated that she was not convinced that they were due to the vaccine, since she thinks it is autoimmune (her body&#39;s immune response to the vaccine). She gets the same type of rash when she gets sick.

                                                The day following the 2nd vaccination dose, I had zero symptoms other than a slightly sore injection site.  Around hour 30 following the vaccination I began to feel warm, and I got up to brush my teeth and cool off in the bathroom.  As I was brushing my teeth, I started experiencing an increasing ringing noise in both my ears that I thought was strange and somewhat alarming, but I didn&#39;t feel any signs of dizziness or dysphoria.  The next thing I remember is waking up the bathroom floor with my husband standing over me.  Apparently I experienced a complete lose of consciousness and feel to the floor, hitting my chin on the bathroom vanity as I feel and splitting my chin open, which I have zero recollection of.  My husband states that when he found me, that my eyes were open, but I was staring blankly at him with a glazed over look and my whole body was limp and diaphoretic.  I came too in about 30 seconds after he found me, but I was very confused, not making a lot of sense, and felt very disoriented and weak.  It took about 20 mins for my fever to break, and to have the strength and power to get up and walk to bed.  We changed all my clothes because I had soaked through them, and he got me into bed after cleaning/bandaging up my chin.  I then slept solidly until noon the next day, which is very unlike me, but since then I have felt relatively fine with no other experiences of fever/chills/disorientation, just some continued mild fatigue off and on.  After discussing with my nursing colleagues, they all had similar experiences around hour 24-30 post 2nd vaccine with fevers, chills, restless sleep, or just general malaise, but no one experienced a complete loose of consciousness, so I reached out to my PCP yesterday, and she confirmed today that I should report this to VAERS.  I have never experienced any form of loss of consciousness/fainting/black-out/syncope prior to this, which is another reason I thought it was important for me to report this.

The itching subsided within 30 minutes after receiving the diphenhydramine. The patient experienced some nausea as well. After monitoring the patient for about an hour she was sent home from work due to the grogginess  from the diphenhydramine.

                                                I had terrible insomnia and the worst headache Wednesday night. When I finally went to sleep I tossed and turned and was cold and hot. I woke up with barely any strength. I slept from 8am-1:30pm Thursday. I had body aches, an upset stomach, muscle aches, and overall felt yucky. Friday I went to work for a presentation and was feeling awful. I had a fever and took some ibuprofen. My injection site was swollen and warm to the touch. I was dripping sweat last night Friday night. My lymph nodes are still swollen under my arm where I got the vaccine and my neck.

At 1:00am the next morning I started having chills and shaking which continued until 4am when I started having back cramps and arm cramps where I had my shot. I also felt feverish and had a very bad headache, so I took 600mg  of ibuprofen. I went in to work that morning and had chills and my skin hurt when my clothes touched my skin. I continued to have a headache also. I was sent home by my boss at 12pm on 1/5/21 because I looked and felt so bad and slept through the afternoon and for 10 hours that night. The next day, I continued to take 6oomg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and still had a lot of fatigue. The day after I was tired but them remained symptom free.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known product safety profile, causality between event allergic reaction to vaccine and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I had some itching and swelling at the injection site but the bullseye showed up later. The infectious disease team did not seem to find I needed any additional treatment. I self medicated myself with Tylenol, Benadryl Zyrtec OTC and Ibuprofen. There was about 4-5 days before the second dose when the symptoms cleared up.

They had me lay on the gurney and checked my pulse ox. My heart rate was 147 but my Sp02 100%.  After about 30 mins or so it naturally came down with no medical interventions.  Otherwise for the first dose my only other reaction was expected fatigue, injection site soreness and mild headache.   Of note - I did go ahead and get my second COVID19 vaccine after consulting with medical professionals on 1/24 and did not experience any chest pounding tachycardia. Maybe mild tachycardia but I was also nervous due to the previous first inject reaction.

A 38-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), subcutaneous on 13Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included unspecified medications (patient take medications). She received on Wednesday (on 13Jan2021) the second dose of the Covid vaccine and she developed a lump and redness in the injection site. In her opinion the vaccine was administered too far up and may have been given subcutaneously, the patient did not know if the injection was too far up while getting on the muscle. She would like to know if this was a side effect of the medication. The patient also experienced pain on 13Jan2021. The patient tried taking Tylenol for pain and took a dose of Motrin for pain, but that was it, the nurse assessed causal relationship between pain and COVID Vaccine was Yes. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Itching that is still ongoing 1 week post vaccination that started 10 minutes after vaccination. I flushed initially, was dizzy, and then began itching to the head and neck. Itching eventually spread to the torso and legs and became generalized. I began taking benadryl 25-50 mg and continuing pepcid as needed afterwards. GERD also severely worsened and has waxed and waned. Itching overall has waxed and waned, but as soon as medications wear off, itching will very quickly return and is intense to the entire, head, neck, torso and upper extremities. I am also getting breakthrough itching as well even with higher dosages of antihistamines. I had to call out from work 2/5/21 today as a medical provider in primary due to the effects of the antihistamines.   I called my allergy/immunology specialist on Tuesday 2/2/21 and he prescribed xyzal 5mg twice daily and hydroxyzine 25 mg at night. I saw him in the office yesterday, and after discussion, overall decided I should not receive the second dose of the vaccine, and when itching subsides and able to be off of antihistamines for 3 days we will do the PEG protocol testing, and in another 1-2 weeks (14-21 days after initial injection) we will do an IgG spike test to see if I developed antibodies.

Started out slowly late morning around 9am and got worse by the afternoon.  Took Motrin to relieve symptoms and slept.  The next day felt better but in the evening on 2/5/21 felt itchy starting from arms and neck.  Then after about 10 min of itchiness in that area and started itchiness down to my stomach and legs.  I took allergy medication prescribed by my physician: Cetirizine HCL 10mg tablet (1 tablet).  No issues after that. Had some issue with the itchiness from the first dose around the 3rd-5th day after the first vaccine was given.  Didn&#39;t take any allergy medications and had a tiny bit of dark circular spots on limps and torso but wasn&#39;t severe.  Thought that was from something I ate, or clothes detergent, etc. so shrugged it off.

                                                I received my first Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on January 19, 2021.  I didn&#39;t have any immediate reaction after receiving the injection, aside from a sore arm.  I&#39;d like to note that when I received the vaccine I was breastfeeding as I do not know if this contributed to my reaction.  About two days after receiving the vaccine, on January 21, 2021, I noticed a red itchy rash underneath my left breast.  I initially thought this could be a complication associated with breastfeeding known as Mastitis.  By the weekend the symptoms had decreased around my left breast and I developed a strong itchy sensation on the left side of my back.  On January 25, 2021 I noticed I had a red rash on the left side of my back, on my left side and on my left breast.  On January 27, 2021, I contacted my dermatologist and made an appointment thinking I had a rash.  On January 28, 2021 I went to see Physician Assistant.  During this visit diagnosed with Shingles.  I do not know if the Covid-19 vaccine lead to developing Shingles.  I wanted to share my experience in case there were other patients who received the Covid-19 vaccine and developed Shingles as a rare side effect.

I took a dose of oral Benadryl it didn&#39;t go away. It felt like a sunburn.  I had a headache starting at the back of my head. 1st and second day, I had pain in my joints. Not muscular pain. It came and went the joint pain - behind my left knee was hurting really bad and then it went away. Then my right wrist would start hurting and then it would go away, etc. The second day, the headache was more mild - like a mild pressure in my head. The redness was still there - the red face and red arms. My left arm at the site was cherry red and about the size of two inch circle and somewhat raised. The third day, my headache was worse. It was not like a normal headache but an overall pressure in head. Pink and a bit larger but didn&#39;t  hurt as  bad on arm- the redness continued for six days on my face. The headache lasted 14 days straight - Motrin, ice, heat and extra sleep was tried for treatment. On 15th day it started to let up. On 16th day, it was very mild headache. On the 17th day, it was a full blown headache again. Day 18 it was gone. On the second week, I had mild pain in my stomach and then that went away. On day 3, I had about an hour - twice that day - where I was short of breath and then it went away - it was just that day - about noon and at night. I took Benadryl and when I woke up that didn&#39;t  happen again. Doctor called on day 12 - when my headaches weren&#39;t going away. He took some labs. My labs were normal except thyroid (and I already have a condition for my thyroid). Dr. gave me a medication for headache but I didn&#39;t take it - it had a possibility of making me tired and I didn&#39;t want to take it.

It could have been there sooner, I was just so sick from fever/body aches, I would t have noticed. It progressively got worse by  the end of the day so I finally took Benadryl before bed. The nurse told me to try not to take anything, but the night before my fever wouldn?t let up and I felt really bad so took Advil. The rash kept getting worse so I ended up taking Benadryl and it helped clear it up. It looked very drug allergy to me. Not raised, just red

                                                2 hrs post injection sudden onset of severe dry mouth that lingered but gradually resolved. Still dry next morning and a couple hrs later it switched to increased salivation.  The evening after injection I had a headache and  just felt general malaise and fatigue, &#34;run down&#34;. Difficulty sleeping that night due to body aches. HEadache, neck and lower back pain. Skin sensitivity when touched, bed sheets kinda hurt my skin. The bodyaches and malaise persisted through out day 2. Tylenol seemed to help.  I slept better that night but woke up with night sweats, completely drenched.  Arm pain at injection site on day 2 that resolved by mid day.  Now 1 week later I have extreme fatigue yesterday and today. I do have hypersomnia but not even my adderall is helping. Not sure if this is related or not.

                                                Around 24 hours post COVID vaccination into her left delt,  she woke up with severe left shoulder and neck muscle pain. She got in touch with her provider and was treated with valium and Celebrex. She reported about 2 cm swelling and fatigue. Thirty hours post vaccination, she had pain and swelling and could barely move. Dr. needed to take valium and Celebrex though for those 48 hours, and would have gone to the ER if they had not helped (the pain was that debilitating)

Also had extreme dizziness, nausea, headache 2 days after injection.  Dizziness, nausea, headache subsided after 24hrs however injection site reaction will go away and come back randomly.  Seems to coincide with getting sick?  Was fine up until 12/29 when I did end up getting sick to include headache, body aches, chills.  I went to go get covid tested which was negative.  I ultimately had a sinus/ear infection.  However injection site reaction had gone away UNTIL I got sick on 12/29 then it showed up again and still have it as of today.

A 39-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included breast cancer survivor, radiotherapy, psoriasis, pre-diabetic, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that: &#34; on 23Dec2020 at 6:00, she woke up and her hand was wet from where she had scratched/busted open water blisters on her hand (same arm that she received the vaccine in).  She also reported a rash and hives on that hand, and a rash unilaterally from the vaccination-side armpit to her breast and collar bone but nothing at injection site.  She stated she took BENADRYL, symptoms subsided until BENADRYL wore off, then resurfaced, took more BENADRYL, then symptoms resolved. Symptoms lasted about 24 hours post injection, patient was left with a &#34;nasty scab&#34; on her hand from where she scratched the water blisters&#34;. The patient outcome of the events was recovered except for the &#34;nasty scab&#34; whose outcome was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She denied having this reaction to a vaccine before, but has had reactions to unknown substances a few times on the scene of calls and had to receive EPI and Benadryl. At 9:20 AM EMS personnel gave her one shot of Epi (with Epi Pen) and a dose of Benadryl. At 9:35 AM pt states she felt better. At 10 AM I checked on her one more time and she said she felt fine. She did ask for the ingredients in the vaccine. Showed her where to find on her paperwork. Advised she may want to get MD clearance before taking shot #2.

                                                I had a slight headache while at work but was fine. I was home and was a little cold and my throat was scratchy. . Then about 9pm all of a sudden I started to get waves of chills. My hand were cold and my feet were frozen. I layered up with sweater and sweatpants to go to bed with a heavy comforter. I just could not get warm. About 1am, I woke up and put on my thick winter socks on because my feet were still frozen. I kept reminding myself to breathe in deeply.  I checked my BPM and it was 80-82 and normally its about low  70s. I woke up about 5:30am and had a really bad headache, injection area and arm hurt, my  body hurt and felt like I weighed several tons making me so slow. I didn&#39;t go to work the next day. My husband took my son to school and I took ibuprofen and went back to bed. Woke up again about 12:30 and felt better.

A 39-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), intramuscular on 22Dec2020 at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heavy (Other medical conditions: Consumer stated, &#34;No, I&#39;m healthy other than being a little heavy&#34;). There were no concomitant medications. Patient stated, &#34;I filled out the &#39;app&#39; after I got my Pfizer Vaccine the first one on 22Dec (Clarification Unknown) but I believe that I have been having a reaction to the vaccination and wanted some kind of guidance on moving forward with the booster and kind of what I should do?&#34; The patient experienced hives and itching like a crazy person when she got the vaccine, 22Dec2020. Treatment in response to treatment, patient stated, &#34;I have taken a lot. It&#39;s hives and itching like a crazy person. So I have been take Ibuprofen, and antihistamines like Claritin, Zyrtec and Benadryl.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering (&#34;I would say may be persistent, may be slight improvement&#34;). The events were related to suspect drug as per reporter.

Once I noticed the hives I took a shower, then contacted the pharmacy where I got the shot at, then took to Benadryl tablets. I also put some extra strength Benadryl cream on my legs as well. The hives were on both legs from the top to the bottom. Very red and blotchy in color, raised all over.  I kept an eye on it through out the night and re-applied cream. I did not go to the hospital or the doctor.

Today, it came back to generalized again. from the scalp to the soles of the feet. I have to work so cannot take Benadryl at this time.  Thought I would not need to see the Dr, hoping it would get better but as it stands today I will need to go see the Dr.

Patient described urticaria around her mouth, forehead, and anterior neck.  She received IM epinephrine from staff at vaccination center (Occupational Health).  She described significant improvement in her hives and urticaria.  She denies ever having experienced any difficulty breathing or swallowing.  She is otherwise in her usual state of health. Patient was discharged home with a prescription for diphenhydramine (25mg oral) and EPINEPHrine 0.3 mg/0.3 mL injection auto-injector. Possible link to vaccine could not be ruled out but the absence of systemic reaction is re-assuring. Tryptase was 5.4 ug/l (within normal limits). Other Labs are unremarkable. Pt was discharged home after observing for at least 2 hrs and she was advised to follow up with occupational health.

                                                I started to feel fatigued and slightly dizzy at 12:30 pm the day I received the shot which would have been about 5 hours after. I also had a low grade fever of 99.2 and arm pain at the injection site. That evening I began to have chills and fever, fatigue, body aches, and nausea. These symptoms lasted until the evening of 1/15/2021. Fever was on and off during that time and ranged from 99.2-100.7.  My arm was very sore during this time and on 1/16/2021 it became very itchy and hot at the injection site so I took Zytrec which helped some with the itching  and was like it this for about 24 hours then subsided.  I did not go to the doctor because my symptoms were not severe and I recovered at home.

                                                Metalic taste feeling of numbness in face with itching started within 25 min. I self medicated with 25mg of Benadryl 15 min before injection because I had the same reaction to the first injection. However it did not prevent the reaction as I hoped it would this time. 30 min post injection I took another 25mg of Benadryl. Once med started working symptoms went away.  At no time did I have difficulty breathing. By midnight I was woken by chills, body aches, and head ache (possibly secondary to the jaw clenching I woke up with too). I took tylenol which did not appear to help which is abnormal for me. Fever, chills, aches continued on throughout the night and through the day into the night. On tylenol fever was noted to be 100.6 Fahrenheit. I was finally able to sleep with tylenol and motrin by 10 pm on 18th for 8 hours. Next day temp was about 97.6 Fahrenheit with mild sweating throughout the day and aches had subsided. Today Jan. 19th all symptoms are gone.

I had a headache and felt confused, I couldn&#39;t remember what to do. The site was sore, I was dizzy, nausea and tired.  This lasted for about 2-3 days .I took the next day off.  The Dr. at my work said it should go away.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

I also started wheezing, had difficulty (not exptreme) breathing and was coughing .  I called a medical professional that I know who has assisted at COVID19 vaccine sites about next steps and was advised to take a benadryl, so I did.  About 45 minutes later felt fully recovered.

Upon questioning she reported she felt hot and itchy. Upon request she removed her jacket. Vital signs normal. She self-administered 25 mg of Benadryl.

                                                After the first COVID19 shot I got very red and very hot.  I had a blinding headache for days.  I received the shot on a Wednesday afternoon and by Saturday I felt like I could claw my eye out, that I had something in it.  I went to the eye doctor Monday morning and was diagnosed with a corneal ulcer.  After the second COVID19 shot I was watched for 30 minutes based on my first reaction.  I again turned very red and very hot.  I had hives on my arms, neck, and behind my ears.  I felt lightheaded and dizzy.  I received 25 mg Benadryl by mouth and was observed for another 45 minutes.  At that time I walked outside and felt worse.  My throat became very itchy and I kept coughing.  I went back in to tell provider and received an epi pen injection into my right leg, they took my vitals, and sent me to the hospital by ambulance.

This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

Then on Saturday night the body aches were progressively worse and concentrated on left side of body. Joints were affected including left wlbow, wrist, shoulder. Hot viral rash appeared on arm right above left elbow that became painful with swelling and  erythema. In Sunday through the following Wednesday, joint pain continued to worsen and settle in additional joints including first 2 metacarpal bones of both hands almost like arthritic pain. Fingers and joints red and swollen. Pain and swelling next settled in toes of both feet, right side elbow, shoulder and knee. On Monday following vaccine I called employee health and they advised me to come and take covid test. I described symptoms and was told they were side effects of the vaccine and to follow up with a doctor if it continues.  My covid test was negative. On the following Thursday I went to urgent care and described my persisting symptoms.  I was prescribed a methylprednisolone pack and hydroxyzine. I was told to use naproxen as needed. Yesterday  the urgent care sent a check up message. I am still experiencing joint pain although the intensity has decreased but it is still significant pain that is disabling my grip and strengrh overall. The joint pain is mostly just in my upper extremities, hands, fingers  and shoulders now consistently. The np prescribed a 10 day pack of meloxicam to try and help minimize the pain.

Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.

She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.

Then on 2/14/2021 I started feeling burning  pain all over my neck and chest. It was slightly red that night. The next morning my chest, neck, and upper back had a red rash . My chest was the worst of it. Felt like a chemical burn . I went to the Doctor on 2/17/2021 and was told it was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine. I continued to take Benadryl, Zyrtec  and was given Kenalog. On Sunday 2/21/2021 the pain was so pain and the rash was only getting worse and now on my face so I went to urgent care. There I was given a steroid ( prednisone) , derma smoothe and Pepcid. It has been 10 days and no improvement yet.

The patient concomitantly received cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) as pre-medication and Lexi pro (as reported). The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL0142, expiry date unknown), intramuscular on 30Dec2020 at 10:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization where the patient immediately after experienced metallic taste in mouth followed by itchy throat that felt constricted. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not had COVID-19. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient was premedicated with Zyrtec and 15 minutes after second dose had tongue numbness and weird tast on 20Jan2021 at 16:15 and itchy face started hours later and then continued with persistent allergies every day since the second dose until present was placed on oral steroid. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received oral steroid and Benadryl as treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I had to call off work for the following 2 days as I barely ate or slept during that time. Seventy-two hrs post vaccination, I was able to return to work with only one remaining side effect: lingering stomach cramps.  Self treated with alternating doses of OTC Extra-strength Tylenol and Excedrin Migraine while I was experiencing migraine, fever, myalgia and joint pain. Also took Ultra-strength Rolaids as needed for bloating and stomach cramps.

The next day (~midday) I broke out in severe hives. At around 12.20 I became very, very sleepy and I lost my voice. At around 12.30 my partner noticed my face was swelling (around my jaw and cheeks).

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

Because my daughter suffers from allergic reactions, I knew to immediately administer Benadryl. I also took an additional dose of Zyrtec and Pepcid, which helped temporarily and symptoms subsided when I called my primary care doctor. I had a virtual visit,  and she then prescribed Medrol.

This was followed by streaks of heat along the back of her scalp, and heat in her chest. After about an hour, the right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder. The patient&#39;s &#34;body stayed that way for about 20 hours.&#34; The patient also experienced hot flashes, which was not something that she ever had before. The patient feared getting the second dose because her body felt so off after the first dose. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination with the suspect vaccine.   The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 39 year old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142 and expiry date: 01Mar2021), via intramuscular in the right arm (deltoid) on 19Jan2021 09:30 at 1.8 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose on 19Jan2021 and stated that she was a victim of a medication error and needed some guidance on how to move forward. An RN (registered nurse) injected her with a 1 ml syringe and then proceeded to say that she didn&#39;t give her the diluent and proceeded to give the patient a 3 ml syringe in the same deltoid. She was having some side effects including arm sore and a headache, so the patient was assuming that she at least got some medicine, but she was not sure how much or what was in either injection she received. She was not sure what kind of dose she received. The patient accidently may have received the vaccine without being diluted. The patient wanted to know what to do now for getting the correct dosage of the vaccine and if she should repeat the series or continue with the second dose and get antibody tests. The patient wanted to know what her options are. Upon follow up on 01Feb2021 and 10Feb2021, it was reported that COVID-19 vaccine was administered incorrectly to the patient and was reported as medically significant serious event. The patient reported that she tried to place a report a couple of weeks ago regarding the vaccine potentially being administered incorrectly. She was not able to reach anyone when she contacted us previously. She reached medical information, but she is unsure if she was able to make a report. The patient further clarified COVID 19 vaccine being administered incorrectly as they had an immunization nurse come to help with their vaccine clinic. For some unknown reason the nurse was giving people two shots at that vaccine administration. Nurse administered one shot that was of the diluted vaccine and one was of the diluent. Caller stated she does not know why the nurse did it this way. The patient has had no side effects from this occurrence that she is aware of. The pharmacist considered the event initially as serious then later provided as medically significant. She feels this way as the patient did not get the full dose and may not fully be protected against COVID. The patient did not directly show the immunization nurse the process of how to administer. The pharmacist was informed by the patient that she got two shots in one setting. The patient received the diluent first the 1.8ml injected and then another injection, the actual vaccine. The diluent was sodium chloride 0.9%. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the Pharmacy/Drug Store. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The nurse was given a vial of Pfizer COVID vaccine and a vial of sodium chloride 0.9% (2mL single dose vial, NDC 63323-186-04). It was explained to the nurse to dilute the active vaccine with 1.8 mL (using 3mL 23G x 1&#34; syringe/needle) of diluent and draw shots from this mixture (using 1mL 25G x 1&#34;) vanish point syr/needle). 1.8mL of diluent was injected into the vaccine vial and the nurse was told to draw up vaccine with the smaller needles. She asked if the patients should expect 2 doses. Assuming she meant the two-dose COVID vaccine series (21 days apart), the reported said yes, each patient gets two shots. Based on the report, the nurse then drew up 0.3mL of diluted  vaccine into a new syringe/needle (23G) and filled up the other smaller syringe with  diluent. Since there were two vials of Pfizer COVID vaccine to be reconstituted, the original fear was that she used the undiluted Pfizer COVID vial to draw up the first dose,  but based on the volume in the second COVID vial (had not been used or added to), the only opened vial at the time was the vial already mixed with diluent. So the patient received 0.3mL of diluted vaccine in the 23G syringe and then received 0.3mL of diluent as a second injection. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The patient provided information to the nurse regarding the reported adverse events with the use of BNT162B2. It was unknown if the nurse considered the Pfizer product had a causal effect to the adverse event. No treatment was given to the patient for the events. The patient stated, &#34;I received my first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. I was injected with a 1 mL syringe in the right deltoid by the Registered Nurse administering the vaccine. I was then injected with a 3 mL syringe in the right deltoid by the Registered Nurse administering the vaccine. I am unable to validate the dose because it was not administered according to Pfizer&#39;s instructions and because there are discrepancies in the documentation. These discrepancies include, order of the injections and the amount of fluid present in the 3mL syringe. Since the injections received on 19Jan2021, I have experienced the following symptoms: headache, fatigue, right arm soreness and a 1&#34; x 0.5&#34; rash on my front torso, left side. I contacted Pfizer on Thursday, 21Jan2021. Pfizer had no previous record of a medication error of this nature and was unable to offer guidance since the medications administered could not be verified. Pfizer was not able to provide guidance on an invalid dose because there was no recommendations for an invalid dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at this time. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Amendment: This follow-up report is being submitted to amend previously reported information: suspect product data (lot number was unknown).  Follow-up (28Jan2021 and 28Jan2021): New information received from contactable pharmacist and consumer in response to HCP telephonic follow up activity includes: reporter&#39;s fax number added and clinical information updated.  Information about lot and batch number was requested.  Follow-up (06Mar2021): This follow up report contains no new safety information.

The current and all subsequent information will be reported under manufacturer report number 2021045475. New information included: new reporter, product details, upgrade the case to serious (patient accidently may have received the vaccine without being diluted upgraded from non-serious to serious), new events (arm sore/right arm soreness, Headache, Fatigue, rash on my front torso, left side.).; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient accidently may have received the vaccine without being diluted. It was noted that &#34;An RN (registered nurse) injected her with a 1 ml syringe and then proceeded to say that she didn&#39;t give her the diluent and proceeded to give the patient a 3 ml syringe in the same deltoid.&#34;

                                                I immediately felt dizzy, like I was drunk. At around 4pm, I started feeling wheezy. It felt like there was a mastiff sitting on my chest. I took some benadryl, which helped. The next day, the feeling persisted and I had a mild cough, especially while lying down. More benadryl. Same on the third day. I did not seek medical attention because I didn&#39;t think it was an extraordinary reaction and I have had much worse reactions to other things in the past that have been managed with benadryl. I thought what I was experiencing was an expected side effect based on the information I had been given. The feeling started to ease by the 4th day, but then the insomnia, mood swings, exhaustion and body aches set in. The cough was sporadic, but still present. Today, I still get the heavy chest feeling intermittently, activity doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect or cause. My arm still itches at the injection site and hurts when touched.  I went back to get my second dose on 4/9. When the nurse asked me if I had had any adverse reactions to the first one, I told her about the chest heaviness and coughing and the other symptoms. She stopped what she was doing and called her medical director. They both decided that the first response was enough of an anaphylactic reaction to be a caution for the second. They refused to give me the second dose because they thought the second would elicit a much worse reaction - possibly to the point of intubation. They told me that I would have to be evaluated by a physician and that I would need a &#34;doctor&#39;s note&#34; in order to get the second vaccine.

                                                Itchiness all over her body; Weird taste in her mouth; dizzy; The initial safety information received was reporting only non-serious adverse drug reactions. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 12Apr2021, this case now contains serious adverse reaction. Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: ER8735) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left deltoid on 31Mar2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Family medical history included that her dad has severe allergies. There were no concomitant medications. On 31Mar2021, after 1st dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, she experienced weird taste in mouth and felt little dizzy both went away immediately, not too concerned. Saturday 03Apr2021 until Saturday 10Apr2021, had itchiness all over her body, she was asking since she had a mild reaction, when she goes next week, if it will be really bad. It was really bad itching, she didn&#39;t think it would go away. Patient thought she had a reaction to the first dose of the covid vaccine, it was not deadly. She was trying to figure out if it was safe to her to get the second dose of the covid vaccine next week. Itchiness all over her body: The only place she did not itch was her hands and feet. Her scalp, back and everything itched. She mostly itched on her torso and scalp. She even itched inside of her ears. She does not take any medications. She was healthy. She has no known drug allergies. She has not started any new products. She kept going about her business, but the itching was getting worse and worse until this weekend. Last Wednesday, 07Apr2021, the itching was so bad that she took a Benadryl to see if it would help. She does not like to take medications. She also used calamine lotion. She took Benadryl children&#39;s dose and it did not help the itching. She thinks that the dose was 10mg, but she does not know for sure. It was a new package, she had just bought it. Benadryl children&#39;s dose did not help at all. All of a sudden, the itching resolved on Saturday, 10Apr2021. She was out a lot in the sun all day Saturday. The sun seemed to help, she does not know if it was related. She did not have any hives. It felt like chicken pox to her but with no pustules. The itchiness all over her body was awful. She does not know. She has never had anything like this happen to her before. Her concern was if she had a mild reaction to the first dose of the covid vaccine, what was going to be like whenever she goes next week for her second dose of the covid vaccine. She was asking if it will be really bad. She was itching so bad that she took a Benadryl to see if it would help. She took Benadryl children&#39;s dose and it did not help the itching. Event itching was reported as serious, medically significant. After reviewing call recording, patient reported when she was at the vaccine facility nothing really major happened, she had a little bit of a weird taste in her mouth, nothing strange. She did get a little bit dizzy but nothing that did not wear off shortly thereafter, so she went about her life normally. The weird taste and dizzy feeling started within minutes of receiving the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. She was lucky enough to work with doctors, so she just talked to them. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the event itchiness all over her body was recovered on 10Apr2021, while the other events recovered on 31Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported pruritus cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.
