I began to feel fatigue around 7 pm that afternoon and fell asleep. When I woke up at midnight on 12/30/20 I noticed numbness beginning in my left foot and spreading into my face over a course of 30 minutes. I never noted any muscle weakness, but felt a tingling sensation on the left side of my body. Then I began to experience chills and sweating. I was able to return to sleep around 2 AM. When I woke up at 5:30 the numbness had resolved.

                                                On 12/24 at around 10 PM, circulation to my 4th left digit significantly decreased after being outside of my car for around 15 minutes during a temperature of about 50 degrees. I realized when sharp pain was felt at the digit. After about 5 minutes the digit felt numb. I got in my car, turned on the heater, and massaged my finger. Sharp pain was felt again as circulation returned to the digit. The event last approximately 10 minutes from the moment I realized the finger was pale until color returned.   This occurred again on 12/27 at around 2 PM as I walked from my car into a store at a temperature of about 40 degrees. This time, discoloration occurred bilaterally on my left 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits and my right 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits.  The event lasted more than 15 minutes with constant massaging.   This has occurred two more times since then, both times occurring bilaterally with minimal exposure to cold.

She called EMS and was evaluated at home at which time her symptoms were improving. They advised that she was not having anaphylaxis and could stay at home. She went to urgent care and received PO Benadryl.

                                                Approximately 15 min after vaccination began to experience tingling sensation under tongue. It was not bothersome so I proceeded to go home. At 2:04 pm, approximately 40 minutes after vaccination was driving home and began to experience an elevated HR, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and throat tightness. Proceeded to pull over to a gas station and felt extremely weak when trying to walk and a tingling sensation all over.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl tablets and symptoms began to subside within about 10 minutes or so. Proceeded to continue driving home and had another episode at 2:49 pm, experienced significant shortness of breath and tingling sensation in mouth spread to back of tongue and it felt swollen. I bought liquid Benadryl instead and took ~20 mL. This episode resolved within 10-20 minutes as well and was okay for the rest of the evening.

                                                Had me wait for 15 minutes after vaccine and started having a redness in neck and was really itchy; whole body big time itchy. My chest - shortness of breath. Gave me a shot of benydryl  - 25 mg in my right arm and I went home and itching still didn&#39;t go away and I took pill of benydryl. Chills next day; super cold; headache; tired - and I couldn&#39;t think straight. Nothing was registering in my head with training at work - felt slow. Went home from took more benydryl. Next morning - pins and needles in back of my head. Went to urgent care (Riverside Urgent Care) and they gave me gave me Vexamethasone - shot it up in my butt and every symptom went away after that shot and I was okay after that.Itching went away after that. Felt weak for about a week afterwards. Went and had second shot yesterday 1/10/2021. They gave me medication with vaccine so I wouldn&#39;t get reaction this time. Gave me liquid 25 benydryl beforehand and had me wait 15 mintues and after 15 min they gave me the second dose of vaccine after the injection and they had me wait for 30 minutes. Right away I started getting itchy and they gave me pill form( 2 pills) of Vexamethsone and itching slowly stopped and they sent me home after an hour. Itching slowly went away - later that day. And today I&#39;m okay.

                                                12 hours after administration, woken up from sleep by tingling, throbbing in lower legs. Described as a nerve and muscle ache/throb, or &#34;growing pains&#34;/RLS symptoms. Put on compression socks which helped, but still too uncomfortable to sleep. Was able to sleep after taking ibuprofen 800mg and drinking water. 6 hours after the ibuprofen was administered, pain returned in lower legs as well as neck/ears  with body temperature swings (cold, teeth chattering to sweating uncontrollably in a few minutes). After 1 hour of trying to sleep but failing, put compression socks back on. Temperature rose to 100-100.2 F, chills causing whole body to shake under multiple blankets. Tingling/muscle pains extremely uncomfortable and unable to rest, took another ibuprofen 800mg and water and was able to sleep. Tingling and muscle pains have continued as soon as ibuprofen wears off and come back more intense each time, most notably in the lower legs and near ears/neck and elbow of arm administered in (similar to &#34;tennis elbow,&#34; assumed to be provoked by inflammation, happened with first dose).

                                                Patient developed angioedema of her eyelids after COVID-19 vaccination.  She received her Covid vaccine on 1/10/2021 at 11:30 AM.  She received the Pfizer vaccine.  She works at a nursing home.  She had some fatigue and tiredness during the day but woke up on the second day without any symptoms.  On 1/30/2021, she developed bilateral eyelid swelling.  The swelling is mild to moderate intensity involving the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally with a prickly burning sensation associated with pruritus.  The reaction lasted less than a day and resolved without any skin desquamation, scarring or bruising.  She denies any hives anywhere else.  She does not have a large local reaction at the injection site.  She denies respiratory complaints, GI symptoms, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, wheezing, swelling of her throat or other symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis.  She used Benadryl with significant improvement.   She had a significant reaction after influenza vaccination consisting of swelling of her face and her eyelids with development of dry patches bilaterally within 2 days, resolving with skin desquamation.  The reaction lasted for 1 week.  She received her influenza vaccination in October 20, 2020.   She was seen in our office in 2012 for bilateral eyelid angioedema with associated urticaria shortly after swimming in the pool.  She was given oral antihistamines ?Zyrtec once daily? with significant improvement as well as prevention of this reaction.  She has not had this reaction  for more than 6 years.

A 26-years-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL3302, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at 17:30, at 26 years of age, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization as she was a front line worker. The vaccine was administered at the facility where the patient works. The patient had no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. On 19Jan2021, about 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine dose (also reported at 18:00) she started having nonstop numbness and tingling in both feet and lower extremities, which has been going on for 46 hours straight. The events were assessed as medically significant, although a visit to emergency room or physician office was not required. The nurse reported that a doctor mentioned Guillain-Barre Syndrome which can lead to progressive muscle weakness and damaged nerves and she is severely concerned, although she has no health history. At the time of the report the reported events had not recovered yet.  The reporter assessed the event related to BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (Method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The injection was incorrectly done too high and too deep into the joint/bursa. She developed sharp pain and started with neurological symptoms most consistent with Parsonage-Turner syndrome, which includes pain in the brachial plexus with weakness, paresthesia which might never resolve. This is an autoimmune disorder. Patient was worsening including increasing pain extending to all the arm, paresthesias throughout arm and hand, feeling of dislocated scapula, tightening of the lateral aspect of the chest. Onset date for all events was 18Jan2021 and resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of events was not recovered with treatment of oral steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID).  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the neurological symptoms, Parsonage-Turner syndrome and other reported events in the clinical context of wrong injection technique due to temporal relationship.

Two days later I had an area of papules on my anterior thigh the size of a half dollar. The right sided back pain then began to radiate around to my hip and the rash began to be painful. My right thigh eventually began to tingle and and the pain increased in severity. On Jan 7th I presented to the acute care clinic at the Clinic and was diagnosed with shingles.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I began having chills and vomited. My fatigue became more severe as well. Later that evening my fatigue persisted and I noticed a rapid heart rate via my Watch. My resting heart rate which usually is about 80 BPM was at 100 while laying down and not engaged in any physical activity. When I stood I was dizzy and had poor balance. While my entire arm no longer hurt, the injection site showed a bump as well. When I awoke the next day my heart rate appeared normal again, and I wasn&#39;t especially fatigued compared to before I got the vaccine. I did experience another minor gastro-intestinal episode later that afternoon, but otherwise my symptoms appeared to have passed aside from the fatigue. By the end of my work day I was very tired again, although it is uncertain if this is due to the vaccine or from my continued recovery from Covid and adjusting to the physical demands of going back to my job in-person. Because I received my vaccine on the same day as my first day back to work, I have no experience working post-covid before having the vaccine to compare my current state of fatigue to. On the evening of 01/07 I noted that fatigue was slightly less pronounced. I do not currently have a primary care doctor but will be calling to try to gain an appointment so that my second dose can be monitored.

                                                Hives; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 27-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021, NDC number: 5926710001), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 08:11 at a single dose in right bicep (right arm) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included urinary tract infection from 21Dec2020 to Dec2020 which was resolved and fine after the antibiotic, ongoing eczema (had this condition basically her entire life), ongoing sensitive skin (always had pretty sensitive skin). Concomitant medication not reported. The patient previously took nitrofurantoin (MACROBID [NITROFURANTOIN]) from 24Dec2020 to 28Dec2020. The patient experienced hives on 01Jan2021 09:00 (also reported as &#34;got it last Wednesday morning and broke out in hives the next day&#34;). Patient stated, &#34;I have a question to you. I got the Covid Vaccine, the Pfizer Vaccine on Wednesday morning like around 8 o&#39; clock and this morning I woke up and I broke out hives. I didn&#39;t know if in two days, I just want to report my symptoms just to make sure everything is okay.&#34; The hives were bad on Friday and took Benadryl and Cortisone cream and it is better now. The hives are not worse; not as bad as it was on the first day. She took about 5 Benadryl throughout the first day: 01Jan2021. Over the last few days she has continued to get small breakouts of hives on pretty much every single spot on her body except for her face; the hives seem to kind of take turns in different areas of the body but have not gone away. She has used Hydrocortisone, lotion and Benadryl for the hives. The outcome of the event was recovering. She is both a sonogram technologist as well as the patient. She asked if she should or should not receive the second dose of Pfizer COVID- 19 Vaccine in response to the hives. She is supposed to get second dose on 19Jan2021; unknown if she will or will not change dose scheduling in response to event at this time.

                                                Fine for ~6-9 hours post injection. But then immediate fever (103F), body ache, extreme joint pain and a feeling of something eating away in my bones, chills, bruised/swollen/pain in left arm (injection spot), fever, fatigue, headache, light cough for 5 straight days. Not able to do normal activities. Took Tylenol and ice pack to alleviate fever. The day after injection, body fell so weak that my body acquired another viral infection (very unusual). No shortness of breath. Eating/drinking/appetite fine. No loss of taste/smell.  I am exactly 1 week from the injection. No fever, just light headache. Able to resume normal activities but gets fatigued fairly quickly (after 3 hours). I am very active and work out 2 hours every day, but may not be able to do strenuous activity/exercise for some time...  I was symptomatic covid last year in April 2019. This was very similar experience but an extremely debilitating, more intense version of the covid that I had.  ***I am unsure if I should proceed with the second dose due to a very severe reaction to the first dose***

Twelve hours later, after waking up those same symptoms were only on the right side of my body. Friday morning, mostly normal physically just with some overall fatigue. Friday afternoon I started to get hives on my chest and overnight into Saturday they were on my lower back, sides, and legs. I took 50 mg of Benadryl every 6-12 hours until Monday mid-day when Benadryl was not helping reduce the hives and so I had full body hives. I did try an drugstore cortisone cream which did not help.  Sought treatment at an urgent care as I was feeling anxious and could not control the itching. I and was diagnosed with likely allergic reaction to the covid-19 vaccine.

The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27. The first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) on 23Dec2020 at 09:25, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) on 11Jan2021 at 09:48. All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.  Pfizer&#39;s safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 31-DEC-2020 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Nerve injury. Review of the database for the PT Nerve injury had the following results: 0 serious clinical trial cases and 1 non-clinical trial case.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 27-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3302), intramuscular in the left upper deltoid muscle, on 13Jan2021 at 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. On 13Jan2021, the patient received first dose of vaccine and immediately (about 5 minutes after she received the vaccine at 10:35) developed non-severe local skin allergic reaction and swelling at the injection site, and some spots around the area approximately the size of pencil erasers. The patient had swelling (about the size of a quarter) at the injection site, along with red dots (about the size of a pencil eraser) that appeared around the injection site. The patient&#39;s vital signs were normal, her breathing was fine, and she had no swelling in her throat or lips. The patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) 25 mg tablet, and a minute or two after taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride tablet, all the symptoms went away. The patient was calling to see if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine. The patient asked if she should get the second COVID-19 vaccine dose, based on her adverse reactions after receiving the first dose. The patient recovered from the events on 13Jan2021.

Majority of the spots appears within the bra line of the patient, started about a week and a half after the first done (1/22/21) but became increasingly worse two days after the second dose (was received on 2/12/21).  First there were many more on the trunk with some patches increasing in size and rash starting to appear on arms and legs as well. Tried benadryl, fexofenadine, and hydrocortisone which helped minorly. Sought medical advice in the clinic (5 days post second dose) and couldn&#39;t identify other source of rash (no new product, no bugs bites, etc). Was prescribed triamcinilone acetate cream to help relive itching and redness, which as of 2/24/2021 is improving slowly.

Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

                                                had a 102 degree fever for about 15 hours which started the evening of 1/5/21, which also included chills and muscle aches. The muscle aches lasted about 24 hours. The injection site was my left arm and I now have swelling in my left axilla which started the evening of 1/6/21 and is still currently swollen. I am an ultrasound technologist and was able to scan myself this morning when I came back to work. It appears I have a cluster of reactive lymph nodes in the area of swelling within my left axilla, the largest measuring 3.0 cm. It is very tender in the area of swelling and the pain radiates down my left arm. I had a lot of pain at the injection site that lasted for about 24 hours, it is now subsiding. However, for the last 24 hours it has been very painful to bend my arm. Any time I tried to bend my arm it sent a throbbing pain down to my left hand, it is still occurring today.

                                                Mild headache about 6 hours after then by about 12 hours after dose had profound chills, body aches, severe nausea and temperature 99.8 F. I treated the nausea with Zofran with some improvement in nausea, but other symptoms continued. My max temperature (without antipyretic affecting) was 100.7 F with continued nausea, body aches, fatigue and headache until the 24 hour after vaccine time frame. After 24 hours, nausea had improved largely to just mild, mild headache continued and fatigue/body aches. Around 28 hours, temp was 100.2 F (outside of last antipyretic dose) with same symptoms. Now around 30 hours out with recent Motrin taken, my nausea is still mild, low appetite, improved body aches and less fatigue. I have not had any site reactions other than pain starting around 6 hours after injection.  Course to come yet unknown.

Since that time, the rash has spread to my back, abdomen, chest, neck, ears. It appears to be urticaria and is extremely itchy. I completed a steroid taper early on and the rash is no loner affecting my face. I am taking daily antihistamines and using hydrocortisone cream for the itching. The rash continues to spread and is made worse with scratching.  I am unsure if this is related to the vaccine, but this has never happened before and I have no known allergies. I got the second vaccine on 1/8/2021 (at the time the rash was improving and I thought it to be poison ivy).

                                                I received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 1/8/2021. The following day I had mild hives on my neck and thigh creases, I attributed it from sweating, hives went away after taking Claritin. The evening of 1/11/2021 I had 1 glass of wine and subsequently broke out into hives all over my chest and neck, took Benadryl that night. In the morning of 1/12/2021 the hives had worsened. I started Prednisone 40mg, Claritin, Pepcid 20mg in the AM and Prednisone 20mg, Benadryl, Pepcid 20mg at night. The following day the hives had mostly resolved and I only took the OTC medications. In the afternoon of 1/13/2021 I rode my stationary bike. After the ride I had broke into hives again on my chest and neck and where my headband sat. I then took Prednisone 40mg, Benadryl 25mg, Pepcid 20mg. Hives have mostly resolved today 1/14/2021, still have the sensation of itchiness. Never had throat closing or shortness of breath.

I took Benadryl and hour after the incident. The EMS monitored me while It was happening and since I was still breathing ok  I decided to leave and get Benadryl since they didn&#39;t have any.

                                                2 hours after the administration of the vaccine, the left side of my face briefly started to tingle. I slept for 6 hours, and when I woke up, the left side of my face was noticeably having pins and needles. I took 25 mg of oral Benadryl and slept for another 7 hours, and when I woke up, my left arm and leg were experiencing pins and needles. The left side of my face was completely numb, and I felt like that side was being pulled down toward the floor. The left, posterior side of my head felt very tingly, and I had a pounding headache behind the left eye that worsened with light.  My boyfriend noticed my smile being different, and after looking in the mirror,  I decided to go to ED. They were concerned about Bell&#39;s Palsy, but with the extremity involvement, they changed my plan of care to a migraine response from the vaccine. I received an MRI, IV Compazine and IV Toradol. My headache went from a 6/10 to a 2/10 after that treatment, but it came back soon after my discharge.

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK5730, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose to prevent COVID-19. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, 08Jan2021 (lot number: EK9231, expiration date: Apr2021). She didn&#39;t have a fever or chills, but she had localized pain which she also had with the first dose. She still has pain in her armpit, to the touch and when she moves it, but there is no swelling, lumps or bumps. The pain has decreased; it&#39;s not as bad as it was when she first noticed it. The localized pain at the injection site was worse with the first injection in Dec2020; she just did not have the underarm pain and she didn&#39;t have any pain until the day after she got the first dose. She got the 2nd dose at 5:30pm, and had pain at around 8pm or 9pm that night. The following day was the height of the pain for the second dose, and it has been decreasing since then. She got both doses in her left arm. Outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                I just wanted to report an incident that occurred after receieving  the first dose of the covid vaccine. It was not one of the possible reaction from covid vaccine but rather administrator error in injecting the vaccine.  The symptoms appeared about 3 hours after receiving the vaccine,  now have numbness, tingling, pain and burning sensation on my left pam in the arm of given vaccine.   Obviously, the person giving the vaccine, hit the nerve.

                                                Reporter received the first COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020 and waited the recommended 15 minutes for observation. After the observation period, she left the facility and started to notice tightness and what she describes as a &#34;bubble&#34; at the top of her throat. She also noticed a tingling sensation in the top of her lip, but did not notice any swelling. Reporter took 25 mg of liquid Benadryl and within an hour the sensation in her throat began to go away. Reporter received the second COVID-19 vaccine on 1/20/2021 at 08:25 AM. She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose. Around 08:40 AM, she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat). Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable. She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination. This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.

                                                About 12 hours post vaccination, I developed body aches and fever and chills which persisted for another 48 hours. I had taken Tylenol 1000mg q6 hours about 14 hours after the vaccine for until Saturday. 72 hours post vaccine, body aches and chills are gone, only intermittent headaches that come and go.  As of 1/3, 4th day post vaccination I have a red bump under the injection site, it is not raised but it is red and warm to touch and it still hurts while moving my left arm.

This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improve; brain fog; retroorbital headache/intermittent mild tension type frontal headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).  A 29-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 12:00 at 29 years old at single dose at Left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (Physician Assistant). A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter stated that she is treating a patient in ICU that got the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020. The patient developed hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction 1 hour later. Seriousness of events was reported to be hospitalization. Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter also mentioned that it was not a mild reaction and patient was still in the ICU, 48 hours later.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylactic reaction and hives cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Unable to lift my arm very far without pain. Worse than any other injection recieved in the past. Pain throught the night-causing lack of sleep. Severe pain for about 24 hours or so then completely gone. My muscle in my arm then felt tight as if there was inflammation of some sort or an injury to the muscle. Upon lifting my arm it felt as if my arm was pulling back. No pain during this action but more of a weakness. No relief from anti inflammatory medicaiton or ice. Sensation in arm noted to be gone on 01/09/2021.

This progressed into chills to the point of shivering and feeling feverish. Overnight I developed another headache and felt very mildly nauseous in addition to feeling fever/chills. Overnight I took 3 OTC Advil, was bundled up under multiple blankets, and got lots of rest. The next day I felt much better, only some fatigue.

Became slightly short of breath and felt my heart was racing. Took 25 mg of oral Benadryl and told to go to ED.  In ED heart rate was 126 bpm and BP WAS 136/99. Monitored in the ED for a few hours with no  further interventions. Heart rate improved to 102 bpm and blood pressure to 129/82.

                                                During the first few hours following vaccination, I had soreness at the injection sight and a mild headache. About 10hours later, I started to experience more severe symptoms including a fever of 101-102deg, chills/cold sweats, a moderate headache, and body aches. This continued throughout the night and into the next day. In addition, I began to experience a burning sensation in my chest, similar to heart burn. I have consistently been taking Tylenol and recently took Tums to aide with the heartburn feeling.

                                                1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present &#34;low back strain&#34; lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn&#39;t 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R&gt;L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R&gt;L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  &#34;STIR signal abnormality&#34; within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial &#34;normal&#34; results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep&#39; she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn&#39;t done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn&#39;t been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn&#39;t thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I&#39;m unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I&#39;m hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.

                                                I received my second dose of the vaccine at 03:00pm on 1/12/21. I noticed around 06:00pm that I started feeling a little tired and some pain around the injection site. I had anticipated this as I felt similar symptoms from the first dose of the vaccine. I took a nap and woke up around 09:00pm feeling some of the worst body aches I had felt in a long time. My arm that I received my vaccine in was painful and warm to the touch. I felt dehydrated as well so I drank a pedialyte, took OTC Tylenol extra strength, and laid down again. Around 07:00am on 1/13/21, I still felt achy, sweaty, and felt pain in the arm that I recieved the vaccine in. I went into my bathroom, and noticed two small red and raised areas around the injection site. I took pictures of the site, and continued to closely monitor through out the day. I ended up calling in sick to work on 1/13/21. It is now around 12:00pm on 1/14/21, and I woke up with a pounding headache, muscle aches, dehydration, nausea, and low energy. I feel like I am hungover or have the flu, and am planning on calling in sick to work again. I reported my symptoms to my staffing department at my workplace on 1/13/21 and wanted to file a report here as well.

They used the 1in needle so I think she got into my tricep but it was nowhere near my deltoid. I have injection site soreness which is why I think she even got to the muscle but I have none of the classic immune reaction symptoms. I wanted it on record in case it was not thoroughly absorbed and then I wouldn&#39;t be covered. I figured with this being so new every mistake matters. I&#39;m going to try and get an antigen test in 2-3 weeks.

Cold sweats, shakes, cold then hot, body aches, fatigue. These happened off and on through the day. When started feeling crappy took temp and it was 99.6-99.8. When feeling cold temper drops down to 97.0  scratchy voice voice congestion, runny nose, little sore throat, when swallowing pills or hard texture foods, sometimes drinking something.  Overall feeling of a cold.  I think it?s important to note that I had Covid-19 in the month  of November and received  my first vaccine December 22nd. I had side effects after the first shot but not nearly as bad as this time. I am nurse in a doctors office if that matters at all. I am still feeling under the weather but wanted to get these down before I forgot them.

A 29-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot#: El3248), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 15:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. At 0230 on 07Jan2021 patient woke up shivering with a high fever. Didn&#39;t realize it was a fever until 5am when  woke up more, temperature taken at that time was 100.6. Fever stayed all day until 2000, no less than 99.0 even with Tylenol and ibuprofen until that time. Also developed body/muscle aches around 1200 on 07Jan2021, and some nausea. Got sent home from work that day. On 08Jan21 patient synced my (brand withheld) and checked my heart rate for day before. Didn&#39;t know it till then, but had heart rate of greater than 100BPM all day on 07Jan2021. Highest it got was 130, my resting heart rate is usually in the 60s. Also on 08Jan2021 no more fever, but whole right arm is in pain and have a swollen lymph node around right clavicle area. Pain with minor touch to clavicle and upper arm (at site of injection). Will be going to visit a doctor to make sure it is just a swollen lymph node since it is now 09Jan08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still swollen and there&#39;s still a lot of pain to R arm. Outcome of event fever was recovered, of others was not recovered.

                                                Around 2 AM on 1/15/21 (about exactly 12 hours after receiving the 2nd COVID vaccine injection) I woke up with severe chills and had a fever of 102 degrees F. Also had joint pain in knees/ankles and thigh muscle pain, as well as injection site pain. Around 9 am, fever had increased to 104.4 degrees F. After taking 1000 mg of Tylenol, fever decreased to between 100 and 101 degrees F. Around 3 pm, fever was still above 100 degrees F so took 400 mg of ibuprofen. By 5 pm, fever was finally below 100 degrees F.  By 1/16/21, all side effects had resolved except lymph node in injection arm was significantly swollen, hot, and tender. By 1/17/21, side effects still resolved besides swollen and tender lymph node.

                                                For 2 days after the vaccinations, my left deltoid/ upper arm was sore. Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

The next morning I had a fever and my joints, muscles, head and even my skin was hurting. My fever never came down to normal even with advil and I was extremely tired all day.  The arm that had the injection is extremely sore with splotches of red (which is expected.) Today, 01/08, I woke up in a pool of sweat. My head is still hurting and I still have a fever. My arm is still sore but my skin and joint pain has improved. I am still very cold. Have been wearing my winter coat in my house even with the heat and the fire place on. I had to take the last two days off work.

                                                I developed mild injection site pain about 5 minutes after the second dose which didn?t happen the first time so quickly. It shortly progressed to a cold/numb sensation from my deltoid down to my finger tips. This persisted but seemed to transition from more numbness to moderate pain from my left scapula, neck and down to my fingers about 7 hours after the vaccine. I also developed intermittent fasiculations of my forearm muscles on the left arm. This morning I woke up with worsening pain, mild numbness but new weakness in the hand and arm. I have a weak grip and can?t fully grab objects. My wrist flexión and extension are also weak as well as shoulder abduction (I am a neurologist by the way so can?t localize it to any nerve distribution). I?m not weak anywhere else and I only have mild arthralgia and diarrhea systemically.

I felt itchy all over.  When I stood up, I felt palpitations and started to feel as if I was going to pass out.  I sat down and I started to tremor and felt like it was hard to catch my breath.  I took an antihistamine and took a puff of albuterol.  I felt a lot better. At 10 AM in the morning, the hives have improved but i still feel some pruritus.

                                                Wednesday 1/13/2021 I woke up feeling like nauseous, then later in the day I started to get itchy in my lower body that was coming and going (I believe I still had some allegra d in my system). On  Thursday 01/14/2021 by noon time the itching had become extreme and unbearable all over my body and felt like my skin was crawling/burning, my chest and parts of my arms were really red . I also developed a lump in my throat that kept getting bigger and felt itchy and couldn&#39;t stop clearing my throat. Around 3pm I took 10ml of Claritin. The Claritin had not really helped however the redness had gone down a lot and by 4:30 I was miserable. Informed by a provider I work with to go to urgent care. I arrived at urgent care at about 5:10 where I was treated for an allergy reaction. I was given  0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 500mL, Methylprednisolone sod suc(PF) (SOLU-Medrol) 125mg Intravenous, Famotidine (Pepcid) 20mg/2ml injection 20mg intravenous, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50mg/ml injection 25mg intravenous.  The itching subsided within 30 minutes, the itchy throat/ lump was still present but was not getting worse and slowly improving.   I was discharged home and was told to pick up famotidine 20mg, otc benadryl and prednisone 50mg to take for 5 days.  got home a little after 7 and was able to eat dinner, let dog out, shower, rest  before going to bed. I did take another 10 ml of Benadryl at 10:30. Woke up without any itchy skin at 5:45 and was able to return to work this morning. I still have a slight itchy throat but it is tolerable. I took allegra d and famotidine this morning. I am holding off on the prednisone because of the immune response to vaccines from steroids. I don&#39;t want to lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Around 2100 the same night, rapidly progressing paresthesia of complete left face without obvious facial palsy yet (numbness happened over the course of about 30min to the point where I had no perception of touch in the left face).  At this point I took 60mg of prednisone and went to bed. When I woke up, the paresthesia/stiffness was less and progressively so since finishing a course of prednisone.   Concerned that this could have been a bells palsy reaction to the vaccine.

The Caller wanted information on side effects specifically looking at platelet or clotting or bleeding issues. Her daughter, (female, age 29 date of birth) received the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine, received it at the (State name), last night. She felt very unwell, nauseous, chills, and then blacked out, fell, knocked out, hit her nose, started to bleed; fainted and hit her face, didn&#39;t stop bleeding for 2 hours. There&#39;s a humongous scar on her nose. It took 2 hours to stop bleeding. She&#39;s going to urgent care today. Her daughter was healthy, yesterday was 2nd dose. In her hand, there&#39;s a rash with different dots/red. She has petechiae/rash on the forearm. Thankfully it (bleeding) did stop. The outcome of events for &#39;knocked out, hit her nose, started to bleed&#39; was resolved on an unspecified date, for other events was unknown. The case was reported as non-serious.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based solely on a chronological association a causal relationship between events blacked out  and fainted and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reevaluated should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 30-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number Ej1685) at a single dose at 09:45 AM 07Jan2021 at left arm for Covid-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient had her first dose of Pifzer Covid-19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 at 12:00 PM at left arm, and experienced very mild reactions which included mild pain at injection site and runny nose/sneezing day after vaccine. The paitent had a medical hisotry of rash to penicillin as a child. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to her first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. In the evening of second vaccine (around 17:00), pain and stiffness radiated from injection site all the way down arm, into breast, and middle of back. She started having chills. Around 10 hours after dose chills became somewhat violent despite being under 4 blankets. Severe headache also started. In the middle of the night to go to bathroom, she collapsed on the way back and was unable to get up for about 20 minutes. She also suffered from tachycardia overnight. her baseline heart rate runs in 60s- 70s, but was in 110s-120s (based on Apple Watch monitoring). Day after vaccine, she was extremely fatigue entire day and spent all but a few hours in bed. Arm pain mostly gone. Headache was very strong and persistent through the day. On second night chills not as bad but still occurred overnight. HR still elevated in 80s overnight. Morning of day 2 still had headache and fatigue. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcome of collapse and unable to get up for 20minutes, pain and stiffness radiating from injection site all the way down arm,into breast, and middle of back was resolved, chills and tachycardia was resolving, headache, fatigue was not resolved. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The reporter considered that the events was non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a chronological temporal association and known BNT162B2 vaccine safety profile, causality between events fainting, violent chills and severe headache and BNT162B2 ((Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reevaluated should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                A few hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed typical arm soreness associated with vaccines.  However, this time I also noticed there was a cold tingling feeling in my arm, leg, and toes on the left side of my body (injection side). It happened on and off and lasted for a few minutes at a time. It was not bothersome and resolved within 24 hours. Soreness the next day was worse than with any vaccine received prior (including tetanus shot) and limited range of motion  but did not interfere with activities of daily living.

                                                Right after the second dose less than 2 minutes my heart rate began to spike. I could feel my heart pumping fast. I couldn?t sit due to this so I began pacing the room. I didn?t know this was a side affect so I thought I was over thinking the second dose. I attributed this to all the worry and doubt the media and people around me try pumping in your head. I thought I was having a panic attack. I didn?t alert any of the medical team there because again, I thought I was over thinking it. A few hours later my heart rate had gone down. My Apple Watch helped me monitor this. The next day I felt pain at the injection site, not my normal self, groggy. Slightly feverish and chilled. I work in a cold environment so I couldn?t quite tell if the chilled feeling was a side effect, or the room. Later that evening around 9pm things took a turn. I began running a low grade fever and was shaking from being so cold. About another hour late my fever was up to 101 and I was still shaking from being so cold. I took about 600mg of ibuprofen. I couldn?t sleep, tossed and turned. Probably another hour later my temperature was 102, still shaking uncontrollably. Covered in about 5 blankets I kept waiting it out. And I?d say around 2-3am I could feel my fever breaking. By late morning my temp was back to normal but I felt achy still. Tired, sore. Definitely sore at my injection site. And I don?t know if this is worth mentioning or not but just haven?t been able to shake that panic attack feeling. Like a worry or a dread over me. I just don?t feel as clear-headed as I did before. This is my biggest concern. Just don?t feel myself yet.

A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose in deltoid right for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on 03Jan2021 and within 15 minutes had a generalized headache. Later that night she had generalized muscle weakness and pain, but really didn&#39;t think too much about it. The next day at work (04Jan2021), she had numbness on the right upper side of her lip and a pins and needle feeling in the right upper quadrant of the face. Had a lot of pain in the area as well on the right upper side of the face as well as a dull aching pain that lasted for hours. Later that day when using the computer and she was trying to reach for her mouse she noticed her right hand wasn&#39;t able to feel anything and that lasted about 20-25 minutes. Kept slapping the mouse with her hand, but could not feel anything, her hand went numb. Yesterday (05Jan2021), she had the same pins and needle feeling in the same area of the face and that dull achy feeling and it occurred for hours and it was very kind of debilitating for her at work.  Later that night she had pain in her right leg and felt the same way, that very severe achiness, which was the pins and needles feeling up and down the leg and underneath the right foot. All these symptoms tend to be on her right side and it definitely lasted for hours. It started about 1 and didn&#39;t end until 6-7pm. It even hurts to move the right eye in one direction and hurts to speak, the pain was so bad. This morning (06Jan2021) she had to call out of work because at 3am the generalized headache, pain was unbearable. She was still experiencing the pain in right leg and bottom sole of right foot. She did not receive any vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. She had made an appointment with a neurologist and will have a MRI done on Friday, 08Jan2021. No further details provided. All events required a visit to physician office. All events were reported as serious per medically significant. The outcome of all events was not resolved. The reporter considered all events were related to the vaccine.   Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship, causality between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiration date: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included testing positive for COVID in Apr2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took flu shot and experienced soreness. The patient did not receive any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient called in regards to Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She received her first vaccine last Thursday, 07Jan2021. She was not sure if she can report this as a side effect, but she had some rashes appear just today (11Jan2021), at midnight, in her neck and chest area. The rashes were going away, but she still has some itching. She also stated that she took some over-the-counter diphenhydramine (BENADRYL, UPC: 1254717031, lot number: PJF044, expiration date: Jun2021) tablets to relieve the symptoms. She explained that she started to experience soreness/ pain at the injection site a few hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The pain in her arm has already went away. She noticed a swollen lymph in her armpit area on Friday morning, 08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still a little bit swollen. She didn&#39;t expect on getting a rash since she read symptoms only appear around 2-3 days only. Therefore, she is not sure if she can report this as a side effect because its been like 3 days already. She noticed the rash just today, at midnight. She stated that she is still itchy. She stated that there is just a little bit of itchiness in her neck. She felt a little bit warm and itchy in her chest area, at midnight (unspecified date), and she kept scratching. She knows she shouldn&#39;t have done that but it was itchy. The patient would consider these events to be non-serious. She did have some soreness with a flu shot before so it&#39;s not too serious. She explained she is a healthcare worker. She works in a nursing home facility and they asked if she wanted to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and she filled out the form. She also explained that she doesn&#39;t have any allergies to any medications. So, with the rashes that came, she is not really sure what is the cause of it. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. She stated she wanted to report this information but she also needs advice on whether she needs to continue taking Benadryl. Her rash is improving, but she is still a little bit itchy. She doesn&#39;t have any shortness of breath or anything. It&#39;s not a major reaction, just a little bit of a rash/itchiness in her chest and neck area. The outcome of the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 10Jan2021, for lymphadenopathy and rash was recovering, for pruritus was not recovered and for feeling hot was unknown.

She had premedicated with Benadryl 12.5mg along with Zyrtec. After itching started she was given an additional 12.5 mg of Benadryl. She was monitored for &gt;30 minutes with improvement of symptoms. Rash still present but she said no longer has itching and that she knew her body well and that she was fine to leave. She stated that her mother was in the car waiting for her since she knew that she might have this type of reaction. We had a long discussion about going to the ER but she said she has Benadryl on her if needed and knew when she needed to get to an ER in terms of symptomatology. We also discussed option of having next dose with an allergist. She would like to call her allergist to discuss options but feels comfortable getting 2nd dose knowing how she reacted this time.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

I stated to have some facial swelling then my throat started to swell/tighten.  I was brought to the ED and an IV was started. They administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The throat swelling started to interfere with my speaking and vocals. They monitored me for 7 hours then I was discharged home. All symptoms returned within a few hours and persisted for a week following. My PCP took over care and prescribed me the following in replace of the medications the ER prescribed: Albuterol HFA, Dexamethasome, Pepcid, Benadryl, Z-Pak, Vitamin D 100,000iu, and Fish Oil. I missed a week of week then was released to work again on 1/25/21.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: ELO140, expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at 11:45 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included neuropathy and migraine.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) and acacia senegal, ascorbic acid, betacarotene, calcium carbonate, calcium pantothenate, calcium silicate, cellulose microcrystalline, colecalciferol, croscarmellose sodium, cyanocobalamin, dextrin, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, ferrous fumarate, folic acid, gelatin, glucose, hypromellose, lecithin, macrogol, magnesium oxide, magnesium stearate, nicotinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol acetate, riboflavin, silicon dioxide, starch, thiamine mononitrate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide (ONE-A-DAY WOMEN&#39;S) on unspecified dates for unspecified indications. The patient has not had other vaccines in four weeks. On 10Jan2021, three hours after being vaccinated (at approximately 3:00 PM), the patient experienced complete numbness to her left leg (from her ankle to her hip/waist). Hours later, the patient noted numbness to her left arm. Her left knee was buckling, making walking very difficult. The patient reported to the ER, and after several hours of waiting to be seen by a doctor, her right side also became slightly numb, and was also tingling. 18 hours after symptom onset (at approximately 9:30am, the day following injection), the numbness on her right side resolved. It was also reported that the numbness on her left side did not completely resolve for more than 24 hours.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab test which was negative on 13Jan2021 . Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included anti-anxiety medication for calming. The outcome of the events left knee was buckling, making walking very difficult and tingling was recovered on unspecified date, while the rest of the events was recovering at the time of report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported complete numbness to her left leg (from her ankle to her hip/waist)/numbness to her left arm,  left knee was buckling,  walking very difficult, right side also became slightly numb and tingling, and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

A 31-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via Intramuscular on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was seen in the ED for petechiae and ecchymoses on 15Jan2021. She had not taken any recent medication or had any illness previous to this event. The only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series. Lab assessment showed platelet count decreased to 22,000 cells per cubic microliter (normal over 140,000). She had no other findings to describe cause of her decreased platelet count by lab or clinical exam. Provided a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia purpura, in the ED setting, she started pulse dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four consecutive days with a follow blood count showing resolution on day 4 of her treatment with a platelet count of 230,000 cells per cubic microliter. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received Steroids as treatment. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of event immune thrombocytopenia purpura was recovered in Jan2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of immune thrombocytopenia purpura due to temporal relationship. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including platelet count at baseline and during therapy with subject drug, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

A 31-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL3247, Expiry date 31May2021, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Jan2021 at 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization as frontline worker. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Hospital. The patient reported that she was fine all day Saturday (16Jan2021), she just had some very mild pain at the injection site started a couple hours after getting injection. She developed flu like symptoms on the following day (17Jan2021) at 18:00PM and threw up a couple times. On 18Jan2021 at noon she noticed that she could barely move her arm: anything above her elbow on her right arm was not moving; it was paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up. If someone were to pick it up and let go, she couldn&#39;t control it at all. She also stated that she had no pain at all in that arm; she couldn&#39;t feel anything at all; it was numb. When she woke up on 19Jan2021 the numbness had moved up her neck, instead of being localized to her arm. She stated that when she touched her neck, it hurt a little, but it was not super significant. She stated that it was debilitating at that point as she was maintaining numbness and &#34;no control of her arm&#34;. The nurse reported that this event had not required yet a visit to physician, but she has a feeling it will. She will probably have to go somewhere due to her paralyzed arm, but she had not yet. At the time of the report the event &#34;No control of her arm&#34;/can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; had not resolved yet; the event &#34;mild pain at the injection site&#34; resolved on 17Jan2021, the events &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; and &#34;Threw up a couple times&#34; were recovering and outcome of the events &#34;Numbness has moved up her neck&#34; and &#34;She touches her neck, it hurts a little&#34; was unknown.  The reporter assessed the events &#34;Pain injection site&#34; and &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; as non-serious and assessed the event &#34;Can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; as disabling. She assessed all the reported events as related to BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events numbness of upper extremity and arm paralysis with BNT162b2 use can not be fully excluded.

                                                The night of the second dose of my Pfizer Covid vaccine, my face began to feel hot and tight. The next day, I began with the expected flu like symptoms of the vaccine, accompanied by a red, fine bumpy rash with some swelling on my face where it had felt hot and tight the evening prior. The flu like symptoms lasted about 24 hours. The facial rash persisted and I began oral antihistamines - diphenhydramine and famotidine. The rash continued for one full week, only improving after beginning to use topical hydrocortisone on my face at the suggestion of a friend who is a nurse practitioner. After improvement in the rash I stopped hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash reappeared about 5 days later, and continues to randomly reappear about once a week to every 10 days. Flares only last about 24-36 hours now and will go away without medication but it does clear faster with hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash only flares at night, and no triggers like heat, alcohol or certain foods seem to bring it out.  I have been consistently taking famotidine and cetirizine daily since the last flare of the rash, and have not experienced a flare again yet.

Sx worsened on day 5, so I had a virtual visit with a medical provider who prescribed me Valtrex x7d to treat suspected Herpes Zoster, which I previously had in my early 20s.

Two hours later the pain had gotten so intense I could not move my arm more than in inch from my body and had to get help performing simple tasks. The next morning, the pain is less intense and I can move my arm, but there is no pain in my elbow and wrist joints on the same arm.

Went back inside and essentially collapsed on the couch 5:30pm- Arm soreness is worse. Chills and lightheadedness only mild now. Fatigue has gone down to where I can resume daily activity  12/29 Wake up with moderate sore throat Stabbing arm soreness at injection site Moderate fatigue  and nausea persist. Mild chills. Tried to go for a walk outside and found a 30 minute very slow walk extremely tough  12/30-1/2 Moderate sore throat continues. Other symptoms gone 1/1-2 Arm/ injection site soreness slowly fades  1/2: exercise for the day= 70 min yoga and 7.5 miles of walking. Had a couple glasses of wine at dinner (possibly relevant if issues with vaccine are related to high histamine food issues)  1/3  Moderate headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Skin feels hot. Sore throat worse than the previous days. Mild runny nose. Severe nausea. Go to Urgent care for COVID test and Zofran Rx. COVID rapid test and PCR test both negative. No fever, higher than usual blood pressure  1/4-5 (current) Nausea lower but still moderate, requiring Zofran. Sore throat persists. Mild fatigue and muscle aches. Skin still feels warm. Mild vertigo during exercise

A 32-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot number EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 12:30 as a single dose (dose 1) in the left arm (age at vaccination: 32 years old) for COVID-19 vaccination. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered wasa hospital. There were no other vaccines given in the 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included diagnosed with COVID-19 on 06Jul2020, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), cervical spondylosis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV); no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), valacyclovir, levonorgestrel (LILETTA), and colecalciferol (VITAMIN D). The patient woke up at 0400 on 22Dec2020 with tympanic temp of 100.8, chills, body aches, and very tender left deltoid injection site pain. The events were reported as non-serious. Treatment with ibuprofen resolved the elevated temperature, however she spent all of 22Dec2020 with fatigue and body aches despite ibuprofen. The tender left deltoid persisted for a total of 3 days and then became more tolerable, less tender. The clinical outcome of elevated temp/ tympanic temp of 100.8 was resolved on 22Dec2020, of fatigue and body aches was recovered on 23Dec2020, and of chills and tender left deltoid was recovered on an unknown date. Since the vaccination, has the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Recieved the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccination on Dec 26th 2020, and had no major adverse reaction to vaccine except for mild soreness and heat around injection site and intense fatigue for three days after. Symptoms went away after the 4th day. Two weeks later on Jan 5th 2021, i began to notice an intense itching, burning, and swelling at the injection site. Pain and soreness in arm made it difficult to do my job and seem to just get worse. Upon the next morning of Jan 6th 2021, pain remained but itching had gone down, but intense burning, soreness and massive redness around injection site remained and seemed to be getting worse. Pain remains and redness has not gone down, arm is very tender near site and lifting and moving arm is very stiff and sore. Feeling of lump or stiffness on injection site comes and goes and feeling of heavy and sore muscles move from upper left arm down to elbow and extend to hand; making movement and function slowed or slightly numb. Stiffness in arm and intense heat at injection site makes it uncomfortable to move or use arm. Cold tingling sensation on occasion and stiffness in elbow joint. Slight dizziness and fatigue follow with pain in arm. Was informed to see a physician on Jan 6th, 2021 who said to fill out vaccination adverse event report and to keep an eye on arm. If pain or symptoms become worse to return.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving my second dose I became flush, and hot from the outside in over my whole body.  I was tingly all over.  I felt shaky  and like I was going to pass out. Very nauseous.  My blood pressure was 169/93 @ 0830. The staff had me lay down.  About  5 min later I started to feel better.  Another 5 min later it happened again in a wave. The symptoms just came over me. My blood pressure @ 0840 was169/104. The staff had me drink water and rest. @0900 the wave came over me again. My BP was 178/111. I drank more water and rested. BP recheck @ 0925 162/112.  @940 BP was slowly coming down at 145/109. At that time they transferred me to the Emergency room.  My BP came back into normal ranges, and the waves stopped happening around 12pm. I was then released home with plans to follow up with Primary care on  1/11/2021

Itching was not intense and could be ignored, no medication taken. Itching subsided after 24 hours but has returned on/off since. Message was sent to OBGYN asking for MD to contact me if he felt issue was urgent.  No contact made but since issue persists will call and ask for lab work.

                                                within 1 hr post-vaccine on 1/7 I had a mild headache that resolved with Tylenol. At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

                                                About 15 minutes after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at Clinic, patient began complaining that she was dizzy and nauseated.  Patient was seated on the exam table at this time, and was helped to lay down on the exam table. Vitals were obtained by RN. Patient began complaining of tingling of her lips while vitals were being obtained at 1110.  PA was notified and brought to the room to evaluate patient. Patient denied having any difficulty breathing or swallowing, was not experiencing any itching of the mouth, tongue or throat, and did not notice anything else unusual, patient was still dizzy and nauseated. Patient stated that she had a similar reaction to the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, where the symptoms resolved within about an hour.  Nursing staff and PA stayed with patient during the duration of her observation. Patients vitals ranged betwen pulse ox = 98-99%, pulse = 97-106 bpm, B/P = 114-121/80-89 mm hg. Patient also complained of some tingling around the lower jaw at 1147. Patient was observed for 1 hour and 26 minutes after vaccination was received. Symptoms gradually resolved, upon discharge patients lightheadedness had resolved, and the tingling around the lips and jaw were mostly gone. Patient still was not having any shortness of breath, chest pain, trouble breathing, rash or hives, swelling/tingling/numbess of the tongue, mouth, or throat. Discharge instructions were provided by PA, including when to seek further care at the ER or to call 911. Patient felt comfortable driving herself home and left at 1214.  About two hours later, pt presented to ED. Pt endorsed throat tingling, lightheaded, nausea. She also stated that while the reaction post Dose 1 and Dose 2 were similar, the reaction after Dose 2 was much more severe. Assessed for transient Bell&#39;s Palsy presentation but determined unlikely as no facial asymmetry or deficits were appreciated. RR 24, other vitals WNL. Pt observed for about 1.5 hours before discharging home with instructions to call ED should condition worsen.

Notified nurse that gave me vaccine, several other nurses came over and helped me into recliner and laid me back and took vitals. Vitals are stable. I quickly began to feel better (within 5 minutes of being reclined). Still had the numbness and tingling. I laid in recliner for 30 minutes, then sat up for 10 minutes before leaving. I drank water and ate 2 rice krispies while in recliner. Numbness and tingling improved, but lingered throughout the day and was gone next morning.

                                                Severe soreness in left upper arm at location of the shot about 5 hours after the shot, the pain extended into the armpit/lymph area of my left arm and the pain remained steadily severe until Friday 1/15- 3 days after the initial injection. At 1pm on day of shot (1/12/21) had feelings of chills, sweaty and whole body aches. This lasted until Thursday morning 1/14 around 7am. During that time, took Tylenol for the aches and feverish feelings.    Arm soreness finally subsided Friday. migraines started Thursday evening into Saturday morning. With little relief from Imitrex (prescription medication for chronic migraines). Went to the emergency room Saturday for a shot of Torodal for the migraine to subside.

Around 2230 that night, I started having intermitted sharp pain in my leg arm pit. 0430 January 20th I woke up with sharp pains still in my left arm pit. By 1030 the pain was now constant and extreme.  I called my doctor and he told me to come into the office to see him. NP saw me and explained that the lymph nodes in my left arm were swollen. Very tender to touch also. He prescribed me Prednisone twice a day for three days, Ibuprofen, and use hot compresses. So far the pain has gotten better.

She really didn?t think anything of it and did not report it to anyone or take any medication for it.  On 1/12/2021 she received the 2nd dose.  On day 7 of her vaccine she developed hives on her lower extremities. She took Benadryl that day and they improved, but did not got away.  On day 8 the hives reapproved and she took a dose of Claritin and that got her through working.  On day 9 (yesterday) the hives have migrated from just her lower extremities to her arms and shoulders.  She took both Zyrtec and Benadryl yesterday, but she is not getting any relief.

In the evening I started to feel feverish. It was at 99.5. When I woke up this morning my fever had progressed to 101.8. I do have soreness near the injection site as well.

                                                I received the vaccine in the left arm on 12/23 with no immediate symptoms. On 12/24 I had body aches mostly on my left side. On 12/25, I started having a strong headache, focused mostly on the left side. On 12/26 the headache continued and I also noticed swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, and behind my ears. Also, it felt like someone had broken my nose and when I would try to bite down or chew I would have a sharp pain and pressure in my nose and sinuses. On 12/27, the headache continued, and I had severe left eye pain, as well as pain chewing and the swollen nodes, that became painful to touch. On 12/28, I went to my PCP and was tested for covid, which was negative. She diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed amoxicillin. On 12/29, I noticed my scalp had lumps on it that were painful and I had a very itchy spot on my forehead, which became swollen as well to about a quarter size lump. I also had other painful spots on my scalp all over and a continued severe headache and left eye pain. I tried to follow up with my PCP on 12/31, but their office was closed, and the on call nurse referred me to urgent care. More painful, swollen lymph nodes have appeared on my face and neck. I wasn&#39;t able to be seen at urgent care until today (1/1), and was then diagnosed with Shingles. I was told to continue amoxicillin and to start taking Valtrex. I am very itchy, mostly on my face, scalp, and left side of my body.

My throat felt itchy and they immediately gave me benedryl.  I was tahycardic as well. When I got home from the ER that night I had to take more benedryl and then the next morning  I was still itchy and my voice was hoarse so I took more xyzal and famotidine. The rash subsided and I continued taking xyzal twice a day , benedryl and famotidine for a week.  After my vaccine the itching did not subside for about 48 hours and it was very difficult to control. I had to take max doses of antihistamines to control the hoarseness In my voice and itching

                                                I received second covid vaccine on 11/8/21 at 7:45am. That night around 7:30pm I started experiencing body aches and chills. The morning of 1/9/21 I developed a fever, head ache and noticed a red, tender area the size of a penny at the injection site. During the weekend the area around the injection site continued to grow. 1/11/21 I noticed the area is itchy, red, tender/tight feeling, and warm. Pain only when the area is touch. This area is 3.5inchs W by 3 inchs L.

                                                On Sunday 12/20 I started to get a significant sharp headache on the left side that radiated down my left neck and arm to the point of injection site. My left arm was also sore as to be expected with typical injection but this sensation was different. It caused a sharp neuromuscular pain that was also itchy/burning. Extended in the region of sternocleidomastoid site. No rash development but seemed like symptoms of shingles. Continued through until approx 12/26/20. Improved with heat pack, Tylenol and Motrin.   Was evacuated by physician on 12/21/20 with no testing or medication provided as symptoms were unclear.

Which is still a little swollen but improving; pain at injection site/painfulness at the injection site; shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 33-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included immunosuppression. Concomitant medication included ongoing vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for immunosuppresion. The patient got a couple of the side effects listed. She developed painfulness at the injection site, and it was red a couple of days. She is wondering if she needs to be worried about getting the second one. It was pretty painful that night. It was pretty painful for the next day. If someone barely brushed up against it, it was very painful. Two days later, her husband noticed her shoulder was very red. And then she realized there was a defined red mark where the injections was. The pain is fine now. She didn&#39;t get a rash or have trouble breathing. She did have a swollen lymph node a couple of days later. Which is still a little swollen but improving. She does take an immunosuppressant. The outcome of the events pain at injection site and shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was recovered, while recovering for the event swollen lymph node a couple of days later was recovering.

She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

Throbbing in temples, eye pressure, pressure on top of head, worsened when I would bend over. Did not take any medication, worried it would impact immune response. Drank a lot of water, slept, did some sled massage, and gentle yoga/stretches. By that evening pain level had dropped down to about a 4. Woke up the next morning with 2-3 level pain, was able to go to work without being distracted by pain. Still felt more pressure behind eyes and top of head when I bent over. Next day all symptoms resolved, except very minor tenderness at injection site only when palpated.

                                                allergic reaction; large red itchy rash on her neck / chest area; trembling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 33-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via unspecified route of administration (lot number: EL1283) in the arm right on 07Jan2021 09:00; at single doses for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: latex. Concomitant medications included magnesium oxide (MAG OXIDE) at 200 mg, daily (every day) and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) at 10 mg, daily (every day); and toprolol at 25 mg, every day (pending clarification for the drug). The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on 17Dec2020 (lot number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination; and has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. Within the 15-minute observation period on 07Jan2021, the patient developed a large red itchy rash on her neck and chest area; she stated she felt fine but was observed trembling. She was transported to ED (emergency department, 5 min transport). She was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) at 25mg IV X1 (intravenous), and methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL) at 60mg IV X1 and famotidine 20mg IV X 1. Patient diagnosis was allergic reaction on 07Jan2021. Patient improved after treatment and was discharged (after being in Emergency room/department or urgent care) as she was observed from 09:11 until 10:33. Final outcome of the events was all recovered on unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the allergic reaction, rash erythematous and trembling are possibly related to suspect BNT62B2 administration.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient was being held for monitoring after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.  Within 1-2 minutes, patient developed facial redness and itching.  She then started to feel as if her throat was itchy and started coughing uncontrollably.  Denied lip or tongue swelling.  Was feeling normal prior to receiving the vaccine.  Was not recently seen/assessed for other medical care.  No similar symptoms previously.  Patient was taken to the Emergency Department.   Ptaient did have a few red splotches on her chest, but these did not appear consistent with urticaria per the ED physician&#39;s report.  ED physician felt patient&#39;s symptoms may be secondary to anxiety.  However, given history of anaphylaxis and feeling of throat itching it was felt necessary to treat for possible allergic reaction.  Patient was given epinephrine, Benadryl, famotidine, and Solu-Medrol.  She was then monitored in the ED for 4 hours.  During this time, she developed no new symptoms.  She continued to breathe easily with normal and stable vital signs.  She was discharged with instructions  to buy OTC Benadryl 25mg PO to take every 8 hours for 48 hours.  Prednisone 20mg, 3 tablets orally daily for 5 days weas prescribed.  An EpiPen was also prescribed.

A 33-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264 and Expiration Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 17:45 at 33-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; with no other vaccines administered within four weeks of the bnt162b2 administration.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to 16Feb2021.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: Bell&#39;s palsy on left side of face (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, vision has been off/ vision is blurry (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, numbness and tingly/burning sensation in right leg (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, brain fog (medically significant) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which required a physician office visit. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, she began having symptoms on the following Saturday and was seen by her doctor and diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. The patient stated she has reported this via VSafe and the Pfizer website. The patient also reported other symptoms that have not been reported as follows: had tingling in both legs, brain fog, and vision has been off. The patient was not sure if it was related to the vaccine or steroids. The patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose. The patient had been on a steroid, so she did not know if she should wait to get the second dose. The patient just stopped the steroid on 16Feb2021, and the second dose was scheduled for 23Feb2021.  The patient also said she had other symptoms that she had not reported and she said she had tingling that started in one leg now in both legs, brain fog and her vision was off and she was not sure if that was related to the vaccine or the steroid (later clarified as prednisone). The patient was not taking the steroids at the time of diagnosis. &#34;Correct I mean it started after the vaccine, but I was also on medication (Clarified as Prednisone) so I am not really sure what the difference is at this time.&#34; Treatment in response to event: the patient stated, &#34;No I mean for the tingling in my leg I have been just putting heat and Ice on it but I have not done anything actual big treatment and then for my eyes no, my doctor is not sure what is related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy and what is to medication.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work: unknown result on an unspecified date (patient stated, &#34;Yes, I have many&#34;).  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of facial paralysis, hypoaesthesia, burning sensation, and paraesthesia; which included steroids and anti-viral and anti-nausea medicine. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination.

I started to feel flush and my heart rate rapidly increased. I felt it was nothing so i tried to calm myself and watch my heart rate on my watch and it continued to increase. It started at 100 and within a minute was at 130. I finally honked my horn for assistance and my symptoms continued. I became very faint and nauseous and felt as though i was going to throw up. open my door and took my mask off to help with getting air and it didn&#39;t do much to help. I felt very light headed and uncomfortably closet o passing out than i ever have. This lasted for a good 10 minutes until it slowly passed. Faint, nauseous, hot and rapid heart rate of 130 were my main symptoms and were very uncomfortable.

I went to Employee Health and was prescribed a steroid but I didnt take it and benedryl and claritin.  I took claritin and benedryl for about 2 days which began to make the rash subside on the 18 but on the 23rd the rash reappeared and went back to EH and was given another round of steroids which I did in fact take this time.  And after the 6th day of the steroid pack the rash has mostly resolved

My injection site (Left deltoid) was swollen and sore, although not more than usual after receiving a vaccine. I had no headache at all. The major concern was the fever and the backaches. I could not get warm, and I was shaking badly because I was so cold. I had ZERO relief despite taking 700 Mg of Tylenol. Side effects finally subsided after about 5 hours.

                                                At around 11:45pm tingling started in my left eyebrow. I thought there was something in my eyebrow and after time of wiping it a few times I went to look into the mirror and realized that nothing was there. about and hour later I got a drink and a snack to eat and I realized I had a numb sensation in the left corner of my lip.  As a nurse I went though the signs of a stroke with 2 other nurses I called. Everything was normal other than that sensation. Thinking I was just overly tired I went to bed. When I woke up the next day I felt okay until I went to drink some coffee and the numb sensation in my corner lip was still there. Now I was concerned and called employee health and was instructed to go to the ER to role out a stoke. I followed employee health&#39;s instructions and went to the ER. I was diagnosed with facial paresthesia and discharged with instructions to come back if symptoms got worse.  Symptoms persisted all day and around 7 I called my mom on video chat to show a visual facial twitch on the left side of my face. right after I got off the phone with her the left side of my face drooped and my fiance immediately drove me to the closest ER. I was seen immediately and they decided to admit me. The did labs and head CT. They admitted me to labor and delivery because there were no other rooms. The next day I was seen by a neurologist and many doctors.

I am experiencing a large circle (a little smaller than a baseball) of swollen red skin that is painful around the injection site. Last night, the lymph nodes in my armpit, neck and collar bone on the right side swelled up and were painful. I feel fatigued.

Shortly after this I had moderate GI upset including diarrhea, cramping for about 24 hours.  Over the course of 48 hours after the vaccine I had swelling at the injection site, tenderness of the injection area to the point where I was not able to put pressure on the area or sleep on my left side and severe fatigue/malaise.    All symptoms resolved after 48 hours.  I am a person and wanted the reaction information to be part of the trial data.

Blood pressure was elevated &gt;180/90, HR 110-120.  Gradually decreased and at approximately 30minutes post injection, blood pressure was &lt;145/90 and HR 84.  Took 25mg of benadryl approximately 1 1/2 hour after injection time. Symptoms persisted mildly for another 30-45 minutes after benadryl and seem to be gone 5 hours later. Blood pressure 5 hours after was 134/85 which is still a slight elevation from my norm.

                                                Rash on neck; gall bladder attack; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 34-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 18Dec2020 10:30 at a single dose for  COVID-19 immunization in the hospital, and morphine sulfate (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose and frequency for an unspecified indication. Medical history included S/P rouxen-y gastric bypass, sleep apnea, cholelithiasis, HSV-2, obesity, and Hashimoto hypothyroid disease. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included ursodiol, valacyclovir, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTH) and vitamins. The patient previously took morphine and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient experienced Rash on neck, morphine reaction and May or may not be related - gall bladder attack on 18Dec2020 14:30. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was administered with NS bolus, diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and also morphine in response to the events. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19 via Nasal Swab/COVID-19 rapid ABBT which was negative on 18Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for morphine sulfate was unknown. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequel. The patient assessed the events as non-serious.   Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of morphine sulfate in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of morphine sulfate has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment hence, the events are conservatively assessed as related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 until further information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I am able to move it but is continuing to tingle only on my left side. My lips, the very side of my tongue, my bottom jaw and my check bone constantly tingle and feel numb, when I talk some spit comes out on that side and my side of my nose also feels numb. As time goes on it isn&#39;t getting any better but not much worse. today my bottom lip just feels more numb

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: Ek9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 08Jan2021 (at 11:00 PM as reported; pending clarification) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at the hospital. Relevant medical history included that the patient had known allergies to medications, food, or other products, but was not specified. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D), curcuma longa (TURMERIC) as supplement, and an unspecified multivitamin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 08Jan2021 (at 11:15 AM as reported; pending clarification), the patient experienced lightheaded, tachycardia, and blotchy rash, which resulted in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lightheaded, tachycardia, and blotchy rash, which included diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and steroid. The patient was recovering from all the events.

                                                On Tuesday, 11/19 about 10 pm, I started feeling some discomfort in my left breast.  The next morning, I was fatigued, had a headache, and woke up with an elevated basal body temperature (I&#39;m normally between 96.0 and 97.5 in the mornings, but ran at 98.2. Not a fever, but enough for me to think it was odd), and some discomfort in my left breast.  By the afternoon, part of my breast was red and warm to the touch.  My temperature was still in the normal range at 98.7 (I checked since I work in a hospital and wanted to make sure I reported any illness quickly).  I went to the ambulatory care center and was diagnosed with mastitis of the left breast and prescribed cephalexin 500 mg capsule QID x10.  After 7 doses, I am feeling better and the tenderness, discoloration, and warmth are gone.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

Gradually  felt it in my whole body by 8:30PM that night, next day I tried to go to work but I had to leave because of the intense numbness and tingling. I also developed left leg weakness and had to even pick up my leg to be able to walk. The NP at my neurologist office (talked over the phone) said it was a pseudo effect due to my MS. My symptoms are still intermittent up to my second dose.  It is all over the numbness and tingling, but as it is subsiding it is now flaring up my symptoms from 2 years ago and I feel it on my second side.

On Sunday I also started feeling chest tightness so I went to the ER. EKG was normal. They told me to follow up with my neurologist. I still have lingering symptoms of tingling and numbness that come and go.

A 34-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EL3284), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety since she was 13 years old. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the vaccine on Monday at 12 o&#39;clock. She got it for work. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She developed the side effect Tuesday at 2 am. The left side of her face started tingling and had numbness, which is the same side she received the vaccine on. She doesn&#39;t have weakness. It is not resolving. It is from her lower eyelid to her bottom jaw bone. When asked if it was improving persisting or worsening, she said it depends. Sometimes it gets worse and affects her lips, and sometimes it is on and off. It won&#39;t be completely gone. It switched between her cheek and jaw and then her nose and mouth sometimes. If she bends over, it tingles worse. It is just very annoying. It felt like if she had Novocain on the top and bottom of her mouth. It is irritating. She got it because she doesn&#39;t want COVID and she works as a nurse. She does have really bad anxiety. She has nothing else medical. She is just really nervous. It is not going away. She is freaking out. She would like more information. The outcome of the event &#34;It is just very annoying/It is irritating&#34; was unknown, while for the other events was not recovered.

                                                Injection site got sore after just a few moments. Site itched. Began experiencing extreme fatigue. Within the first 15 hours following the injection I began experiencing extreme full body pain, neck, back, arms, legs, hands, and fingers. As well as experiencing a major headache equivalent to migraine pain. The pain was intense and lasted around 36 hours. Pain had subsided within 48 hours excluding pain at injection site that continued but was significantly milder.

I started experiencing injection arm soreness around 2100. By midnight I was experiencing chills and body aches. The morning of 1/27 my Temp was 100.0 and I was still having body aches and chills/feeling feverish. This continued throughout the day. I took one dose of Tylenol 1g and later ibuprofen 600mg. The morning of 1/28 I still had a mild headache and temp of 100.00 but overall was feeling much better - no more chills or body aches. My temp prior to going to work that night was 98.6 and my headache had resolved.

Developed low grade temp, flushed face, fatigue, muscle stiffness, body aches hours following vaccine. Aches and fatigue continues and it?s now day 8. The fatigue is constant but comes in waves. I?m taking unexpected naps which are abnormal for me. Caffeine and methylphenidate are ineffective. I?m still sore. I also have brain fog, maybe from the fatigue. I can?t think straight and it takes me longer to process and do tasks. I woke up 2 hours ago and I can?t wait to sleep again.

                                                Vaccination was at 9:17am. Injection site arm pain and stiffness was noticeable by 12pm, and gradually worsened to incredibly painful by 8 pm, especially in muscles between left  shoulder blade and spine. Chills began around 9:30pm at which point I took one 500mg Tylenol and went to sleep. I woke up with severe chills around 1:45 am and pushed off taking more 500mg Tylenol until 2:45 am. Afterwards I began to feel heartburn and slight nausea but was able to fall back to sleep. I woke up around 3:45 am to vomit. Afterwards, the nausea subsided and I was able to go back to sleep until 6:45am. I woke up with a headache which got worse and I took one Aleve at 9 am. By late afternoon I was feeling much better.

                                                On Saturday morning I woke up with a headache and swollen lymph nodes in my neck/collarbone area. As the day progressed, I began to have pain in my joints and muscles. I felt very tired all day as well. I also experienced skin sensitivity which basically just made my skin hurt if anything/one touched me. Sunday my headache persisted, still had pain at injection site and felt warm to the touch. Swollen lymph nodes also still there and fatigue. Monday morning symptoms of headache, injection site pain and warmth and swollen lymph nodes still felt.  Taking Tylenol to help with headache, warm compresses to help swollen lymph nodes and ice pack for injection site pain.

My left arm feels weaker and feels some numbness when more pressure is placed on it.  I have a bruise that appeared above my left wrist.  I have reached out, as this is my employer and I have not heard back.  Assuming they were closed due to New Year?s Day.

                                                COVID-19 vaccination administered IM in left deltoid around 6am. Patient called pharmacy around 10am and complained that the injection was delivered too high and she was experiencing pain at the site. Vaccine placed high on L shoulder, just below acromion process, at or above humeral head. Seemingly placed between acromion process and humeral head, near or in soft tissue/bursa. Site pain is inflammatory in nature and does not seem to affect muscles, but instead is contained within joint itself.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 03Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 35-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma (no medication used), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and reflux, headaches, and COVID-19 (prior to vaccination). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications, taken within two weeks of vaccination, included pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PROTONIX), venlafaxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for headaches, curcuma longa (TURMERIC; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and probiotics (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced heart palpitations, elevated heart rate and blood pressure (BP), initially burning/tingly injection site, then back of throat/tongue/lips were tingly and numb feeling, then throat got hoarse on 03Jan2021 at 14:30. The events were reported as non-serious. The events required a visit to the emergency room. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included: BP: elevated and heart rate: elevated, both on 03Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, which included treatment with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL), and famotidine (PEPCID). The clinical outcome of heart palpitations, elevated heart rate and blood pressure (BP), initially burning/tingly injection site, then back of throat/tongue/lips were tingly and numb feeling, then throat got hoarse was recovering.

Just interesting that it was just on the left side of my body where I received the vaccine.

Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP and they said to call employee health.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline.

A 35-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EH9899), intramuscular at arm left on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at other (as reported). Medical history included asthma (Allergy induced asthma). Concomitant medication within 2 weeks of vaccination included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) from Dec2020 at 10mg daily.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 31Dec2020, the patient experienced Left Bell&#39;s palsy, numbness and paresthesia of tongue, left side of face, inability to raise left eyebrow, pain in left upper arm between elbow and shoulder, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure.  The adverse events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the adverse events which included Prednisone 20mg daily, Valacyclovir 1000mg twice a day. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the Bell&#39;s palsy and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  However, the Bell&#39;s palsy may possibly represent a concurrent medical condition.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including viral serologies, and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

Also a red circle formed around (bigger that the bump), and the area is hardened and painful.   The person could not raise the arm either.  It last approximately 5 to 7 days to improve symptoms.   But still painful for approximately 3 weeks (at the time for the 2nd dose).    The situation repeated with 2nd dose in the other arm (will report separately).

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

Then I felt like I had been hit in the head with a bat, but the pain migrated from side to side in my head. It was a very strange feeling. The hot, tingly numbness lasted about 45 minutes to an hour, the headache began to subside after 2 hours. The next day I had a little raised redness and the injection site and a bad headache, but was otherwise fine. At the vaccination site they strongly advised I go to the ER, which I did. I have no history of vaccine reaction.

A 35-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 12Jan2021 14:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Latex allergy, chronic migraine, seasonal allergies, and had previous anaphylaxis due to insect stings. Concomitant medication included sumatriptan. The patient previously took Tylenol and experienced allergy. It was reported that the patient experienced minor itching of arms (not at injection site) and around lip. It was reported that the event started shortly after the thirty minute (15:15) wait after injection and ended around an hour after injection (15:45). Patient further reported that she has previous history of anaphylaxis due to insect stings. It was not bad enough to seek treatment and it took a bit to realize that it wasn&#39;t just a result of her worrying, but it was noticeable. No hives, no redness. Patient did not feel the need to seek treatment, but she did monitor symptoms until they eased. Vaccine was from a vial with no latex, due to existing minor allergy. No treatment was given to the patient in response to the event. There was no COVID prior to vaccination and no COVID test post vaccination. The patient recovered from the event on 12Jan2021 at 13:45.

Later that evening my injection site was sore, itchy, and raised, like a hive.  On 2/23/21 I woke up at about 7:30AM and the injection site was the same as before, but I also had a sore/stiff neck and headache at the base of my skull.  The reactions have not warranted a trip to the doctor, but I remember hearing somewhere that the CDC was interested to know about any side effects that may be related to the vaccine.

                                                Injection received at 0815. At 0900 I started getting diaphoretic, clammy, nauseas and my face was flushed. At 0930, I developed hives on my neck, chest and arms. I immediately went back to the vaccination site (I was still in the hospital at work) and was administered 25mg oral Benadryl and monitored for 30 minutes. The hives resolved, but I still felt unwell. At 1600 I noticed a swelling in my right upper thigh about the size of my hand. It was about 2 inches inferior to my inguinal crease and was the width of my thigh. It was mildly painful to the touch. My injection site was red, inflamed and itchy. I continued taking 25-50mg Benadryl Q4  and took 100 mg at night due to itchiness on my eyes, face, neck, chest and arms. This is still present, although less each day, as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I have felt feverish but have not had a recorded fever. I took some Ibuprofen for the pain in my arm at the injection site. The redness, swelling and itchiness has decreased each day at the injection site, but is also still present as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I still feel unwell and have continued diarrhea throughout the weekend.

Flushing of hands; Dizziness; Fatigue; Legs became heavy; Joint stiffness of hands; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ 1685), intramuscular on the left arm on 23Dec2020 at 06:30 AM in a hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies of seasonal allergies, cats, and metals; migraines, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and angioedema. The patient was not pregnant and did not have any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination and did not test positive to COVID post vaccination (also reported as not been tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination). Concomitant medication included propranolol, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), and sertraline (reported as other medications in two weeks). On 23Dec2020 at 06:45 AM, the patient experienced immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands; flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands. She was monitored by colleagues for an hour, prescription for Epi pen refilled, and available angioedema and fatigue persisted for three days. It was reported that the patient was not treated for the adverse events but it was also reported that the AE treatment also included X-ray and antibiotic. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands, flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

                                                I recieved my injection at 1:00pm.  My arm became sore around 3:30pm as expected.   I became very tired  around 5pm.  Around 6:30 I experience heat on the left side of my neck up to the back of my left ear.  Also tingling,  mild swelling,  and drooping on left side of face that lasted a couple of hours.   The next day I still experienced the heat feeling in left side of neck up to the back of left ear, fatigue, and soreness in arm.   But by 3pm I felt fine and haven&#39;t had any problems since.

                                                On 1/6 at approximately 9am hour, I noticed joint pain in my fingers while typing, muscle soreness in my upper back, a headache, and a slightly sore throat. It quickly went down hill with a fever, chills, worsening joint and muscle pain everywhere, nausea, severe fatigue, worsening sore throat, tingling and numbness in all extremities at random locations. It is now 3pm, about 21 hours since vaccination-fever has broken once (I took ibuprofen at 2pm) but returned but not as high, and severe headache with light sensitivity. The joint pain and numbness has faded but I am left with severe muscle soreness, like I was in a car accident. Oh and I lost taste sometime today. Also I had injection site pain for both doses, starting the morning after.

It was so sore that it woke me up a few times at night and 1/1/21 I had to take Ibuprofen 400 mg to alleviate the pain. Had a dull headache all day 1/1/21 and very tired. Slept that night from 9 pm - 8 am next day.  No symptoms since 1/3/21.

I let the nurse in the observation area know and honestly didn&#39;t think much of it. It lasted about a minute or two. I was fine for several hours after just experienced the normal soreness and kind of achy tired feeling. Around 1700 I began to itch, my whole right arm and upper torso area was itchy. I did not take any medications for this and it subsided around 2000.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EJ1685) intramuscular at arm left, on 19Dec2020 06:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing acne. Patient had no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication included isotretinoin (ACCUTANE). On 19Dec2020 11:30, approximate 5 hours after vaccine, the patient experienced pain, joint pain and tenderness at injection site, progressively loss of strength and eventually inability to move arm. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL1284, expiry date not provided) on 23Dec2020 09:15 intramuscularly in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as preventive). There was no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The nurse (patient) received her first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at the hospital that she worked at. She was kept there for 15 min for monitoring and she felt fine. About 30 minutes post vaccination she got a hot flash, a flush over her face, she does not know if she was red but she felt flush. Her tongue felt strange, nothing swelled that she could tell, it felt hard to swallow, to make the motion to swallow it felt kind of sluggish. She felt weird swallowing which lasted for only a few minutes. She never struggled to breathe. She went back to park in the hospital parking lot since she was not sure if she was experiencing a anaphylactic reaction and then after a few minutes it went away. Her arm was sore and heavy feeling for that day. She had drowsiness for a couple of hours and pain and redness at the injection site for a couple of days that was not bothersome, it was mild. No relevant test. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine due to the symptoms she had after the first dose. The pain and redness at injection site was resolved on an unspecified date in Dec2020, while the other events were resolved on 23Dec2020.  The reporting nurse considered the events hot flash, flush all over her face, arm was sore and heavy, drowsiness, pain and redness at injection site were non-serious, while the events &#34;tongue felt strange, it was sluggish to swallow&#34; were serious that she drove back to the hospital (no emergency room/phycian office visit). She considered the events were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162Bw on the reported events cannot be excluded.

I found it difficult to ambulate and lift my arm at all. This was followed by malaise, weakness, and fatigue. The decreased strength and sensation on the left side of my body lasted for several hours, gradually fading around 4am. The weakness of the left side of the body improved over time and I was just left with fatigue and malaise.

This 36-years-old female nurse reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021), via unspecified route at left arm on 21Dec2020 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; she also started to receive ustekinumab (STELERA injection), via subcutaneous from 2017 (last injection on 04Nov2020) at unspecified dose every 12 weeks for psoriasis. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer vaccine. Historical vaccine included influenza vaccine on Nov2020 for immunization, which was 5 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. Vaccination facility type was hospital.

She woke up 26Dec2020 and felt completely fine. Patient was wondering if being on ustekinumab made the symptoms from the COVID Vaccine worse. Action taken for ustekinumab was unknown. Outcome of events was recovered on 26Dec2020.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 from Mar2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced body aches, dry mouth, can&#39;t sleep, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and pain at the injection site, temp was 38.1 Celsius, head feels weird in Jan2021. The patient got her first dose and was looking online to see the symptoms. She said that she saw that during the trials, people were experiencing the symptoms she was experiencing after the second dose and she was concerned. She said that she wanted to make sure her symptoms are ok and to make sure that the symptoms are not just caused from the booster, but also from the first dose. The caller said that her mom told her that someone died from the Pfizer vaccine. No further details provided. The patient was having body aches, could not sleep, her mouth is really dry, her temp was 38.1 Celsius, her head feels weird, she has generalized weakness, pain at the injection site, and decreased appetite. She said that it was like having Covid again. She said that she had Covid back in Mar2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 38.1 centigrade.  The outcome of all the events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the suspected COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

A 36-year-old-female patient (non-pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 06Jan2021 at 08:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergies to gluten and penicillin (PCN). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took cefaclor (CECLOR) and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the patient&#39;s workplace clinic. The first dose was given at 08:30 on 06Jan2021. A few minutes after, the patient became dizzy and lightheaded for what seemed like a minute or two and then she was fine for the remainder of her 15-minute observation. Around 17:00 that day, the patient became itchy on her right arm and upper right torso area, no rash or swelling was noted. Itching subsided around 20:00 - almost 12 hours post-vaccine. The events were considered non-serious. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from the events on 06Jan2021 (&#34;Itchy on her right arm and upper right torso area&#34; at 20:00).

First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

I got tachycardia (I tend to have a rapid hart beat but this was pumping pretty good). I also had some GI distress (watery diarrhea) and that lasted for a while. Later I got really weak and shaky, fatigued, that night I woke up with night sweats, and chills, woke up completely drenched, I had to change the sheets and pajamas. 5 days after the vaccine I was really exhausted, the fatigue was awful. There was also an itching sensation but no hives.

                                                On 1/13/21 I noticed some tingling in my feet and hands. This has continued and worsened - I have constant &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensations in both feet and it is extending up to my knees. It&#39;s also in both hands and extending up my arms. Last night it was up to elbows, now it&#39;s going above my elbows. It doesn&#39;t go away. I was unable to sleep well because of the sensations. I&#39;m also starting to feel tingling in my back and shoulders. I called my doctor and he said to fill out this form and report the ER if my symptoms don&#39;t improve over the weekend.

Later in the evening I had the same feeling in my left leg and in my cheeks, lips, tongue and teeth. I felt like I had been numbed at the dentist, but was coming out of the numbness. It was like when the numbness is mostly gone and you&#39;re left with that tingling sensation, and your face feels puffy. It was basically that feeling in my face, left leg, and left arm. Those sensations are mostly gone today (the second day following), but not quite.

Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid.

They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck. She was hot, flush, and dizzy. She felt like she was going to throw up. That passed. They then gave her Epi in the opposite arm, her right arm. She got the COVID vaccine in her left arm. Then, they got her ready to go to the hospital. The transfer was smooth. She was waiting for intake when she started to not be able to swallow. She complained quickly. The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours. Then sent her home with Pepcid, more Epi pens, and Prednisone for 4 days. She has had normal soreness in her arm at the injection site. It has been status quo, it feels like a tetanus shot.

A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

As such per the guidance I remained in the waiting room for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I had a light rash on both forearms and near the injection site on my left upper arm. I felt fine otherwise. I went up to the nurse in the monitoring room and showed her the rash. She asked if I was having trouble breathing. At the time I was not. She said I could take Benadryl for the rash as long as I had no allergy to Benadryl. I started driving home. During my drive my throat started to feel itchy and irritated. It proceeded to get worse and when I looked at my throat in the mirror it was very red and starting to be visibly swollen. I drove to the nearest hospital and checked myself in to the emergency room.

It was non painful at first, but now it is tender. It is roughly the size of an egg/golf ball. I also have tenderness on my chest  above my right breast but on the pectoralis muscle. Nothing in the right armpit. I also had aggressive itching at the injection site and a hard area and red welt.

This has been occurring since after receiving the first vaccine, with increased severity after the second.  The symptoms last from 20-2 hours after exposure and then resolve.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

These spread to my upper extremities and became consistent. Occasionally will appear in lips and trunk. These are associated with sensation of numbness and some discomfort in my extremities. I&#39;m also experiencing significant brain fog, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Headaches are occurring about every other day.

A non-pregnant 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: Unknown), intramuscularly in the left arm on 19Dec2020 at 37-years-old at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included intermittent asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: mild asthma attack on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, moderate dyspnea on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, chest pressure on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, a 4-5 cm area of induration in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, mild erythema in her left deltoid area in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown. The patient had intermittent asthma with no attacks in the past six years. Two days after the vaccination, she had a mild asthma attack when she was walking up stairs. For the past two days, she has had multiple asthma attacks, with moderate dyspnea and chest pressure present for most of the day. The patient&#39;s symptoms have been improving with her as needed (PRN) salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. The physician saw the patient in a telemedicine visit and found her to have an asthma exacerbation; therefore, prednisone was prescribed. The patient had no symptoms of viral infection and reported testing negative for COVID-19 after the onset of her asthma symptoms. The physician suspected her asthma exacerbation to have been caused by the vaccine because she had been symptom-free in recent years and she has not had a new exposure other than the vaccine. In addition to her respiratory symptoms, the patient had a 4-5 cm area of induration and mild erythema in her left deltoid area; this appeared about 1 week after she received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild asthma attack, moderate dyspnea, chest pressure. The patient, since the vaccination, had been tested for COVID-19. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Pt did not have any other symptoms, just the achy shoulder. Pt also reported a brief burning sensation in her shoulder that subsided within 1 minute. She later felt that same sensation in her forearm and it also subsided. It was recommended that she go to the ED for monitoring since the pain was radiating further from her shoulder. ED RN took her in at 0905 and I left.

A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EH9899) via intramuscular on 19Dec2020 09:00 on left deltoid at a single dose for COVID-19 prophylaxis. The patient medical history, family history and relevant tests were reported as none. Current concomitant medications included multivitamin took 2 chewable gummies sporadically for years as supplementation therapy. The patient previously took Flu shots she got a sore arm. It was not bad. Tetanus gives her a sore arm, but that was all. Caller wanted to know what she should do for preparation to safely get second dose of Covid vaccine and how to fix what she was feeling right now, making sure it doesn&#39;t get worse, considering she is still having symptoms. Caller stated that she had side effects of tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat. The transferring agent stated that he has a caller on the line that was calling about the Covid-19 Vaccine and reported that the patient got the shot on the 19Dec2020 and was inquiring about to proceed with her weird side effects. Caller had not told her physician about her symptoms yet. Caller clarified that she said a half an hour after the dose on 19Dec2020 09:30 she said that she had a Globus sensation or like a lump in her throat. Caller also reported that the back of her tongue felt swollen. Caller said that the Globus sensation was intermittent and it was not as prominent now as it was. Caller said that it was medically significant, but she has not sought medical treatment yet. Caller said that she still had a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site. She said that the injection was high but reported that she did not have a lot of injection site pain, it very minimal. No emergency room or physician office required. The outcome of the event tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat was recovering and the outcome of the event a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site was not recovered and the outcome of the event minimal injection site pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible chronological association between vaccine administration and onset of the events. Causality cannot be completely excluded.

My eye started to hurt with pressure. The tingling in my arm and hand went away after 30 minutes or so but there was still some tingling of my face, toungue and the pressure of the eye still remained. That night I took a Zyrtec and felt better for a few days. on 1/8 I started to feel tinging in my tongue and pressure in my right eye again. I took Zyrtec that night and it went away. Currently this morning I feel okay and hope it wont come back.

                                                Covid toes, red tender slightly swollen toes with mild purple discoloration at the tip of toes, developed 3 days after receiving the first vaccine dosage in the series.  I have tested negative for covid as of 1/10/21.  It was initially thought that I had a skin infection from clipping my nails too short and was prescribed doxyclycline. I saw an improvement within a few days on the antibiotic but them saw a reappearance of the covid toes presenting symptoms on 1/8/21. I have since been told by a physician that I likely have covid toes and not a bacterial infection. I was told to take baby asprin and that is helping to reduce the symptoms.   In the past few weeks I have had no symptoms of Covid besides the appearance of covid toes. I understand that covid toes are often a latent symptom and that the timing of the appearance of this symptom could be coincidental. I am mildly concerned that the first vaccine dosage could have caused a flair up of a potential previous covid infection or could have caused the red covid toes symptom itself.

The headache continued and soon some fatigue and tiredness accompanied it for 7-10 days following vaccination.  Then ten days after, I had an increase in symtpoms that included heightened fatigue, loss of appetite, feeling &#34;cold&#34;/ &#34;hot&#34; (no fever), and abdominal pain with nausea and some diarrhea.    Two weeks after vaccination, I had an increased of fatigue and not feeling well, accompained by a fever of (101.5 F) and chills, sore throat, and lethargy.  My symptoms of fever, chills, sore throat, body aches, congestion, and fatigue remained over the next few days and soon included chest pain and some increase work of breath.  With two negative Covid tests through work, it was recommended I go to see a physician, who instead sent me to Immediate Care.  There I had an EKG which showed sinus bradycardia and they sent me to ER due to my symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath.   At the ER, multiple tests were run to negative results.  ER Physician suspects that some of my struggles could be related to Covid vaccine but that I also may have caught an non-Covid virus on top of it which led to acute bronchitis.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

At 2300,  I started to have fever/chills, up to 39 C orally. This only partially responded to Tylenol. I was not able to sleep.  At 2:30 am I noticed an unusual headache, 8/10, as well as bilateral eye pain on Moving eyes side to side as well as sensitivity to light. Headache was mostly frontal, which came and went every few minutes  until exactly 11:38 am on 1/14/2021, when the fever and myalgias very suddenly got significantly better. Almost exactly 24 hrs to the minute after injection. On 1/15/2021, I still have significant pain in my left arm, swelling, redness and, now, itching at the injection site. My lower back still hurts.

She had red blotches all over her neck and chest. She said her throat was tight. She was able to swallow the water she requested. I gave her 50mg of benadryl.  She had no visible signs of being unable to breathe. I explained to her we could call 911. She reported she had no insurance. She said she was on her lunch break at the hospital and wanted to get back. She did walk back across the street unassisted. Clinical observer, followed her over just to verify she made it in the building. She ended up checking herself into the ER instead of returning to her shift.

A 37-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ek5730), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 28Dec2020 12:00PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at hospital facility. Medical history included Hashimotos disease. The patient had no known allergies and has not had COVID prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she felt tired and confused and unwell on day of injection, 28Dec2020. After three days (31Dec2020), she developed hives on her stomach and arm and seven days later (04Jan2021), she was diagnosed with pneumonia and continued to have hives all over her legs and arms to this day. The patient was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She underwent Covid test/ Nasal swab post vaccination on 09Jan2021, pending result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported pneumonia was more likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

On day 10 (12.31) began to again experience arm pain and new rash over injection site.  Pain spread to opposite arm and then became generalized. Pain worse in armpits. Rash turned into raised bullseye over injection site prompting MD visit. COVID tested completed and was negative blood work sent and is pending.  I was started on Pepcid/benedrly and doxycycline.

In about 10 min I felt very hot in my face, back and felt like I was going to pass out. My heart was racing, it was about 130. My BP initially was 139 and then 160 after that. I never passed out but I felt those waves with a tingling to my face and my neck as I was going to pass out and I started shaking and my heart was racing and my BP was up and it lasted about 45 min before it started going down.  They gave me some Ibuprofen at the Employee health and they kept observing me and it started getting better after 45 min. I still felt the waves of feeling flush and hot and cold and very fatigued.

A contactable 38-year-old female Nurse (patient)  reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021) at single dose since 22Dec2020.  Relevant history and concomitant drug was none. The patient excepted Covid 19 vaccine could decrease the chance of contacting Covid 19 virus, while she stated she was getting a red patchy hives and itchy waves of red rashes all over the body just after received the vaccine. The patient (nurse) stated, &#34;I would if I can explain a little more, the day after I received the Covid vaccine I had noticed a big like what I would explain it like a red hives, like a raised red rash on my left hip it last like a day its subsided and next morning I woke up and I had a different flares that was the same on my other side of my body again went away. After a day when I woke up and I had two new spot on my knee that was the other thing, those went away on that day. This morning I woke up and I had another one on my shoulder and on my lower back. I am also thinking I am getting one may be on my ear like I said they pop up and they itch a little and they go away. I never ever experienced anything like it and I see the only thing that I have changed in my life or regimen or added to my body so I just wanted to make sure it was reported. I am nervous and curious if it is a potential side effect added if I should be careful before getting second one all those things.&#34;  No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of events was unknown. When probed for the Causality, the nurse stated, &#34;I have no idea, if it is something going on with me that is completely unrelated its just occurred right after I got the vaccine so I have no idea if this is a separate issue or not. I going to see dermatologist and physician but until then I just thought to report it to you all to see if anybody is experiencing this and to know if it is safe to go for second dose.&#34;

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in right arm on 26Dec2020 11:30 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was given at nurse&#39;s hospital vaccine clinic. Medical history included narcolepsy with cataplexy. Concomitant medication in two weeks included venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR SR), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took naproxen and erythromycin; and experienced drug allergy.  On 26Dec2020, the patient stated &#34;At about 1150 my tongue started to get a little bit of numbness and tingling. I didn&#39;t really feel nervous but I thought maybe some type of anxious reaction. So I thought I&#39;d give it just a little time and over the next 20 minutes the numbness and tingling progressed to the roof of my mouth, my gums, my lower lip, underneath my tongue, up my cheeks and up underneath my eyes on both sides. I was not feeling anxious about the vaccination. I didn&#39;t have any trouble breathing or difficulty swallowing. It felt like Novocain that was wearing off like after you have dental work done. I decided to take 25mg Benadryl to see if it went away. And it definitely got better about 25 minutes after I took the Benadryl. Within an hour I would say it was 95% gone. Still just like a trace numbness on my cheeks. When I woke up this morning (27Dec2020) I noticed the facial numbness had completely resolved.&#34; The adverse event start time also reported as 11:45 AM. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered on 27Dec2020.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                7 days after my first Pfizer COVID vaccine, I developed mastitis. It began in the morning with mild generalized muscle and joint pain and progressed to moderate to severe joint pain, a fever of 102 degrees, and localized redness and swelling of the left breast over the course of 12 hours. Treatment with Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 14 days was initiated within 12 hours of onset. The systemic symptoms resolved within 24 hours of treatment onset and the breast redness and swelling resolved within 72 hours.   While I am aware that an infectious mastitis is likely unrelated to the vaccine, I opted to report this incident because I have breastfed 3 children and have never had mastitis prior to this event  and because of the limited information available on this vaccine in lactating women.

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

I fell asleep. I woke up around 0200 on 1/13/21 with extreme muscle and joint aches, a sensation of pins, needles, and tingling all over my body I felt very jittery and was actually shaking slightly throughout the ordeal. I felt like my nervous system was overloaded and my perception of pain was extremely heightened. At one point during this 4 hour period I had a visual hallucination. By 0600 I was feeling better- more relaxed. Muscle aches and sore joints are still present today. Also have a slight increase in temp 99.6 and injection site pain.

                                                Approximately 28 hours after injection I started experiencing intermittent numbness and tingling in the right hand. At 33 hours post injection developed a deep dull aching pain throughout entire right arm. This worsened, and after 2 more hours intermittent sharp shooting pain down the arm. Pain rated 6 out of 10 intermittently with a constant 3 out of 10 full ache.  Difficulty falling asleep due to discomfort and at one point the pain woke me up from sleep. It was resolving by early the next morning, and disappeared by hour 48 post injection. These pains were not inclusive of the soreness and tenderness of the injection site or the muscle pain when lifting the arm. Those symptoms are still present to a minimal extent 54 hours after injection, at the time I am writing this report.

                                                Within 2 minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported experiencing throat swelling, face and lip tingling. Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known product safety profile, causality between event allergic reaction to vaccine and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient got the second dose of the vaccine at 06:45AM, and the hives began on the 21Jan2021, she noticed them about 06:20AM and she had to be at work at 07:00AM. She said she treated that with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL, 25mg LOT: P120108. EXP May2022, UPC: 193968051518) because her face started itching and her throat was getting dry, so she took BENADRYL 25mg this morning about 06:40AM. She says she took one dose of this by mouth, because it seems to make her sleepy and she had to work. She says she got to work and started working, and her face was starting too itch and be red, and her throat was super dry, this was at 07:20AM, so she took prednisone (NDC: 20603-5338-31, LOT 8675217, EXP Dec2020) 60mg by mouth. She says this was expired, but she still took it, it is in a dose pack that has a box that says distributed by (Company name). She says she took Prednisone 60mg, one time today by mouth.

Started out slowly late morning around 9am and got worse by the afternoon.  Took Motrin to relieve symptoms and slept.  The next day felt better but in the evening on 2/5/21 felt itchy starting from arms and neck.  Then after about 10 min of itchiness in that area and started itchiness down to my stomach and legs.  I took allergy medication prescribed by my physician: Cetirizine HCL 10mg tablet (1 tablet).  No issues after that. Had some issue with the itchiness from the first dose around the 3rd-5th day after the first vaccine was given.  Didn&#39;t take any allergy medications and had a tiny bit of dark circular spots on limps and torso but wasn&#39;t severe.  Thought that was from something I ate, or clothes detergent, etc. so shrugged it off.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I turned bright red - my face and my forearms. Not a rash or raised rash. It was a deep red flushing. I took a dose of oral Benadryl it didn&#39;t go away. It felt like a sunburn.  I had a headache starting at the back of my head. 1st and second day, I had pain in my joints. Not muscular pain. It came and went the joint pain - behind my left knee was hurting really bad and then it went away. Then my right wrist would start hurting and then it would go away, etc. The second day, the headache was more mild - like a mild pressure in my head. The redness was still there - the red face and red arms. My left arm at the site was cherry red and about the size of two inch circle and somewhat raised. The third day, my headache was worse. It was not like a normal headache but an overall pressure in head. Pink and a bit larger but didn&#39;t  hurt as  bad on arm- the redness continued for six days on my face. The headache lasted 14 days straight - Motrin, ice, heat and extra sleep was tried for treatment. On 15th day it started to let up. On 16th day, it was very mild headache. On the 17th day, it was a full blown headache again. Day 18 it was gone. On the second week, I had mild pain in my stomach and then that went away. On day 3, I had about an hour - twice that day - where I was short of breath and then it went away - it was just that day - about noon and at night. I took Benadryl and when I woke up that didn&#39;t  happen again. Doctor called on day 12 - when my headaches weren&#39;t going away. He took some labs. My labs were normal except thyroid (and I already have a condition for my thyroid). Dr. gave me a medication for headache but I didn&#39;t take it - it had a possibility of making me tired and I didn&#39;t want to take it.

                                                About 45 mins to an hour of receiving the vaccination , i felt  a terrible pounding headache, I took Tylenol ES 500mg after felt relief  but decided to sleep early. When I woke up this morning my injection site arm felt so painful and heavy and i had fevers between 103-101.5 though I took some tylenol 500mg every 6 hours. Tachycardic between 140-120bpm, i still have  terrible headache, muscle &amp; joint pains, extreme fatigue. Some dry cough but no shortness of breath.

                                                2 hrs post injection sudden onset of severe dry mouth that lingered but gradually resolved. Still dry next morning and a couple hrs later it switched to increased salivation.  The evening after injection I had a headache and  just felt general malaise and fatigue, &#34;run down&#34;. Difficulty sleeping that night due to body aches. HEadache, neck and lower back pain. Skin sensitivity when touched, bed sheets kinda hurt my skin. The bodyaches and malaise persisted through out day 2. Tylenol seemed to help.  I slept better that night but woke up with night sweats, completely drenched.  Arm pain at injection site on day 2 that resolved by mid day.  Now 1 week later I have extreme fatigue yesterday and today. I do have hypersomnia but not even my adderall is helping. Not sure if this is related or not.

She got in touch with her provider and was treated with valium and Celebrex. She reported about 2 cm swelling and fatigue. Thirty hours post vaccination, she had pain and swelling and could barely move. Dr. needed to take valium and Celebrex though for those 48 hours, and would have gone to the ER if they had not helped (the pain was that debilitating)

Over about an hour or 2 I could feel the numbness/tingling/strange sensation move across the top of my right lip and into my right nostril.  I took benadryl and it seemed to stop the spreading but the strange sensation stayed on the right side of my face for about 4 days afterwards.

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (COVID-19 vaccine) lot no: EL0140, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 18Dec2020 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux and known allergies to PCN, both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient was not pregnant at the time of report. Concomitant medication included omeprazole (PROTONIX), ibuprofen (MOTRIN). No other vaccines were administered in four weeks. On 19Dec2020 at 14:30, the patient experienced fever 102.9 &#34;normal for vaccines i know&#34;, tingling in lower legs neuropathy like, severe cramping in hands and feet, and severe bone pain. The patient recovered from the events in Dec2020. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of bnt162b2 and the onset of neuropathy like cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Administration of vaccine was given about 3 inches too low, not sure if it went into muscle or subcutaneous but I did end up with an injection site reaction 2 days later to include a 2x3 inch red, itchy, raised, hot to the touch welt.  Also had extreme dizziness, nausea, headache 2 days after injection.  Dizziness, nausea, headache subsided after 24hrs however injection site reaction will go away and come back randomly.  Seems to coincide with getting sick?  Was fine up until 12/29 when I did end up getting sick to include headache, body aches, chills.  I went to go get covid tested which was negative.  I ultimately had a sinus/ear infection.  However injection site reaction had gone away UNTIL I got sick on 12/29 then it showed up again and still have it as of today.

She denied having this reaction to a vaccine before, but has had reactions to unknown substances a few times on the scene of calls and had to receive EPI and Benadryl. At 9:20 AM EMS personnel gave her one shot of Epi (with Epi Pen) and a dose of Benadryl. At 9:35 AM pt states she felt better. At 10 AM I checked on her one more time and she said she felt fine. She did ask for the ingredients in the vaccine. Showed her where to find on her paperwork. Advised she may want to get MD clearance before taking shot #2.

Then about 9pm all of a sudden I started to get waves of chills. My hand were cold and my feet were frozen. I layered up with sweater and sweatpants to go to bed with a heavy comforter. I just could not get warm. About 1am, I woke up and put on my thick winter socks on because my feet were still frozen. I kept reminding myself to breathe in deeply.  I checked my BPM and it was 80-82 and normally its about low  70s. I woke up about 5:30am and had a really bad headache, injection area and arm hurt, my  body hurt and felt like I weighed several tons making me so slow. I didn&#39;t go to work the next day. My husband took my son to school and I took ibuprofen and went back to bed. Woke up again about 12:30 and felt better.

                                                Hives; Itching like a crazy person; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (Nurse Practitioner). A 39-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), intramuscular on 22Dec2020 at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heavy (Other medical conditions: Consumer stated, &#34;No, I&#39;m healthy other than being a little heavy&#34;). There were no concomitant medications. Patient stated, &#34;I filled out the &#39;app&#39; after I got my Pfizer Vaccine the first one on 22Dec (Clarification Unknown) but I believe that I have been having a reaction to the vaccination and wanted some kind of guidance on moving forward with the booster and kind of what I should do?&#34; The patient experienced hives and itching like a crazy person when she got the vaccine, 22Dec2020. Treatment in response to treatment, patient stated, &#34;I have taken a lot. It&#39;s hives and itching like a crazy person. So I have been take Ibuprofen, and antihistamines like Claritin, Zyrtec and Benadryl.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering (&#34;I would say may be persistent, may be slight improvement&#34;). The events were related to suspect drug as per reporter.

                                                I broke out into sever hives all over my legs. I noticed them around 5:00 pm, but I had been itchy prior to that I just did not notice the hives. Once I noticed the hives I took a shower, then contacted the pharmacy where I got the shot at, then took to Benadryl tablets. I also put some extra strength Benadryl cream on my legs as well. The hives were on both legs from the top to the bottom. Very red and blotchy in color, raised all over.  I kept an eye on it through out the night and re-applied cream. I did not go to the hospital or the doctor.

Today, it came back to generalized again. from the scalp to the soles of the feet. I have to work so cannot take Benadryl at this time.  Thought I would not need to see the Dr, hoping it would get better but as it stands today I will need to go see the Dr.

Possible link to vaccine could not be ruled out but the absence of systemic reaction is re-assuring. Tryptase was 5.4 ug/l (within normal limits). Other Labs are unremarkable. Pt was discharged home after observing for at least 2 hrs and she was advised to follow up with occupational health.

Looking at it there was a red raised bump at the injection site that had not previously been there. Since having the vaccine the only other effect I had was arm soreness the day of and day after the shot.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

Upon questioning she reported she felt hot and itchy. Upon request she removed her jacket. Vital signs normal. She self-administered 25 mg of Benadryl. About 10 minutes later she reported developing a headache but otherwise reported some improvement in feeling hot and her facial/arm redness improved. She was originally given discharge instructions including home precautions and released to self, however a few minutes after leaving the patient walked back into the vaccination site and reported itching in throat with clearing throat.  Patient was administered epinephrine 0.3mg IM and transferred to ER via EMS.

This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Brand=Pfizer; lot number: EL3248) via an unspecified route of administration at right arm on 13Jan2021 at 09:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension. No known allergies. No other vaccine in four weeks. Other medications in two weeks included hydrochlorothiazide/losartan potassium (LOSARTAN/HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE), pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PROTONIX), multivitamins/plain (reported as MVI), biotin, docusate sodium (COLACE), Adde (to be clarified). The patient was not pregnant. Facility type vaccine was at Hospital. No COVID prior vaccination. No COVID tested post vaccination. The patient experienced adverse events included tiredness, painful swollen lymph nodes, injection site soreness; all with start date on 13Jan2021 and with outcome of not resolved. No treatment received for events. It was also reported right deltoid had been sore, lymph nodes on base of her neck started to become swollen and tender; kind of a side effect it was worst, and neck had really become sore; all on 13Jan2021 and with outcome of unknown. The patient stated she had the vaccine on 13th and her right deltoid had been sore.

Then on Saturday night the body aches were progressively worse and concentrated on left side of body. Joints were affected including left wlbow, wrist, shoulder. Hot viral rash appeared on arm right above left elbow that became painful with swelling and  erythema. In Sunday through the following Wednesday, joint pain continued to worsen and settle in additional joints including first 2 metacarpal bones of both hands almost like arthritic pain. Fingers and joints red and swollen. Pain and swelling next settled in toes of both feet, right side elbow, shoulder and knee. On Monday following vaccine I called employee health and they advised me to come and take covid test. I described symptoms and was told they were side effects of the vaccine and to follow up with a doctor if it continues.  My covid test was negative. On the following Thursday I went to urgent care and described my persisting symptoms.  I was prescribed a methylprednisolone pack and hydroxyzine. I was told to use naproxen as needed. Yesterday  the urgent care sent a check up message. I am still experiencing joint pain although the intensity has decreased but it is still significant pain that is disabling my grip and strengrh overall. The joint pain is mostly just in my upper extremities, hands, fingers  and shoulders now consistently. The np prescribed a 10 day pack of meloxicam to try and help minimize the pain.

                                                2 days after the vaccine I developed a rash around the injection site 2/6/2021. After three days the rash was gone without treatment. Then on 2/14/2021 I started feeling burning  pain all over my neck and chest. It was slightly red that night. The next morning my chest, neck, and upper back had a red rash . My chest was the worst of it. Felt like a chemical burn . I went to the Doctor on 2/17/2021 and was told it was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine. I continued to take Benadryl, Zyrtec  and was given Kenalog. On Sunday 2/21/2021 the pain was so pain and the rash was only getting worse and now on my face so I went to urgent care. There I was given a steroid ( prednisone) , derma smoothe and Pepcid. It has been 10 days and no improvement yet.

                                                tongue numbness; weird taste; persistent allergies; itchy face; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable health care professional (patient).  A 39-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL8982, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pre-diabetes and allergies to penicillin both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient concomitantly received cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) as pre-medication and Lexi pro (as reported). The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL0142, expiry date unknown), intramuscular on 30Dec2020 at 10:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization where the patient immediately after experienced metallic taste in mouth followed by itchy throat that felt constricted. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not had COVID-19. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient was premedicated with Zyrtec and 15 minutes after second dose had tongue numbness and weird tast on 20Jan2021 at 16:15 and itchy face started hours later and then continued with persistent allergies every day since the second dose until present was placed on oral steroid. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received oral steroid and Benadryl as treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.
