                                                No symptoms or pain with initial injection.  I came home about 2 hours after the injection and took one 200mg ibuprofen and one 500mg acetaminophen and put an ice pack on the site briefly.  Later that afternoon I developed pain at the injection site that progressively got worse over the course of the evening so bad that I could not raise my left arm of touch the site.  I put an ice pack on again and that night I slept with a heating pad on.  I would rate the pain 8/10.  When I woke the next day the pain was still there, but not as severe.  I got in the shower and let the hot water beat on the injection site and that seems to help a lot.  The pain gradually lessened over the course of the day to a 2/10.  By the following day (3rd day post injection) the pain had completely subsided.  There was no redness or swelling at the site and I did not have any other symptoms other than the intense injection site pain.

This 60-year-old female nurse (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 to 23Dec2020 at 0.3 mL single on left deltoid to prevent getting the COVID vaccine, for protection. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed in her mid twenties, in the 80s, she had asthma when she was a child, then it stopped and resurfaced in her mid twenties, ongoing eczema diagnosed years already, a long time ago and unspecified allergies with medications.  There were no concomitant medications. She received the vaccine on 23Dec2020. She has a lot of allergies in Dec2020, and had some side effects, and she got through it ok. Her side effects were some swelling of arm, a rash developed, like 5cm x 4cm at site of injection, chills and shivers, and a bronchospasm cough on 24Dec2020. Arm swelling event started 24 hours later, no more, it was stable for 24 hours, and the 3rd day, went down, was a little raised, the next day was flat but still red. She had recovered completely. The 4th day was a good day. The patient stated she had some allergy shots she had to go through before, this was no different. Rash was no more, it was gone by 27Dec2020. She was still able to go to work. Chills and shivers started 24 hours later, and took for 48 hours intermittently, she had since recovered completely. The patient stated this was all nothing different than getting like the flu shot. Bronchospasm cough event only took another 48 hours, the difference was, even when she calls it bronchospasm, it was close to when she had an asthma attack, but no chest tightness, shortness of breath, she just would cough, spasm in Dec2020 and stop. She had recovered completely. The patient stated she had no symptoms at all before the vaccine, she was healthy, she made sure nothing was going on, that she was not tired, had no cold, she took no medications for this, as she wanted to know how her body reacted and if it can handle it. They says it was ok to take paracetamol (TYLENOL), but she did not, but the second dose she would, now that she knows and she was comfortable through it. She did have some mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores that came up in Dec2020, but nothing to run to the hospital to the doctor for. Clarifies this occured after she received the vaccine. The outcome of the event allergies, mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores were unknown. The outcome of rash at site of injection was recovered on 27Dec2020. The outcome of other events was recovered in Dec2020. The causality between Pfizer COVID vaccine with some swelling of arm, rash developed 5cm x 4cm at injection site, chills and shivers, bronchospasm cough was related (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection).

                                                I received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 1/7/21 which resulted in slight redness and soreness at the site.  This gradually dissipated over a few days, but not completely.  On Friday, 01/15/21 a couple hours after exercising (elliptical and hand weights) at the site of vaccination was redness, soreness, and heat. Upon waking up Saturday, 01/16/21, the redness, soreness, and heat had increased - area was 6cm x 7cm - contacted pcp and was advised to go to Urgent Care, which I did and was prescribed Doxycycline for possible cellulitis.  Today, 01/18/21, sx&#39;s have much improved.

The reporter considered (method of assessment: Global Introspection) that all the events were related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: All the reported events were possibly related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship. However, it is worth noting that the 60-year-old female patient had car accidents history and had surgeries. All the events started when she worked nightshift, including leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out, nauseous, threw up twice, pain through whole body, tremoring and transient deafness. Patient did not get rest after vaccination may a risk factor to the onset of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130.

She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it.

                                                There are two events I am reporting, one each from the first dose on 12/19/20, and the second dose on 1/9/21: Approximately 53 hours after Dose #1: Redness on hands and wrist, rash-like small dot appearance on hands and wrists, skin dryness and tightness  of hands. I experienced no itching of hands or wrists. Approximately 53 hours after Dose #2: Small, painful red pustule-like occurrence on base of right thumb, with the appearance of a few small dots in it. I experienced no itching of  thumb or hand. These events both occurred within the same timeframe following the vaccine doses. Following the first event I was seen in the ER. I checked out fine and they could not say exactly what this was. They said it did not appear to be an allergic reaction to the vaccine because it was not systemic and I had no other symptoms such as trouble breathing. They thought perhaps it was coincidental...I work in the hospital as a radiologic technologist where I hand-wash and hand-sanitize all day. Perhaps I just over-washed that day? However I&#39;ve worked there for 17 years and never had this happen. The redness and rash dissipated by end of day. Following the second  event I did not follow up with any medical provider. This pustule I got happened while I was at home, and otherwise I felt fine so I left it at that. It took several days for the pustule to  go away. I hope you don&#39;t mind but I am writing to report this information in the event it may be helpful to you and I am also reporting it because I want to know if what I experienced could be considered an immune response to the vaccine? Another words, not an allergic response but an immune response ? I can find absolutely nothing about this on-line and no one knows what to make of it. Thank you.

A contactable Nurse (patient) worked in outpatient mental health reported that a 60-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 16:20 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine administered at hospital and not military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included ongoing Graves&#39; disease (the patient had her thyroid irradiated away for Grave&#39;s disease 25 years ago). Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine 1.25 mcg once daily by mouth Graves&#39; disease taking for 25 years. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. The patient received her Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 04Jan2021. Since then she started to experience a genital itch immediately; a rash that was across her body; eyes were swollen and itchy; new itchy rash 13Jan2021. She felt okay going home then she started to have itching around the genital area. She thought she might have a yeast infection but she didn&#39;t have any other symptoms for a yeast infection. Her vulva became swollen from 05Jan2021 and itchy from 04Jan2021 and she noticed rash around her body. It all started in the genital area. The next day the rash spread down her thighs and she noticed an itchy place on her face, but you couldn&#39;t see it. Her thighs were inflamed and she noticed patches of angry whelps on her hips as well as a itchy rash area on her tailbone that seemed more like shingles; size of a quarter; raised, itchy, rash, that felt like it was radiating out. Then she noticed the rash on her face on her cheek, general swelling on her eyes and itching on her eye lids. Now the genital itching was less and most of her symptoms were improved but her eye was driving her crazy and it was more swollen on the outside. She tried to treat her eyes with eye drops Dry Eye Relief (manufacturer Similasan; no UPC seen, lot number: 15942; expiration date: Sep2022, ingredients include Belladonna) but it didn&#39;t help. They were still itchy and weepy. The eye drops were not working. She also treated the rash and itching with Benadryl at night and it improved the symptoms overall. She took Tylenol (UPC 300043760; lot number: PMA003; expiration date: Aug2022) and Bayer Aspirin (81mg; lot number: NAA93E1; expiration date: Feb2023. No UPC code on bottle) every day for general arthritis symptoms, but they didn&#39;t touch her dull headache she has had on and off since the vaccine. Before she got the vaccine, she had a little tag on her vulva, it was tiny. Now after experiencing the itching, swelling, rash on her vulva, the tag was gone. It just took a layer of skin right off. It was not uncomfortable but the whole layer of the skin was gone. It was very uncomfortable while it was happening but now it was okay. When she noticed these symptoms, she tried to call occupational health and a institute but didn&#39;t get anyone. She also contacted her HCP but had not heard back. It seemed to her like a lot of side effects and a lot of itching. She didn&#39;t have it in her throat, but all that itching seems a lot like an anaphylactic reaction. She was curious whether we would recommend her to take the second dose since they say the reaction to the second dose was worse. She had multiple COVID tests that have all come back negative. A friend tested positive so she had a test; and she had a test when she traveled. The events did not require a visit to physician or emergency room. The patient had reactions: itching, rash, swelling, welts, shingle like rash on tailbone, genital area, hips moving to her face, itching and inflammation, in eyes as well. She wanted to know if the 2nd dose was recommended. It was &#34;like an anaphylactic reaction but not in her throat.&#34; itching around the genital area, vulva started from 04Jan2021, vulva was swollen started from 05Jan2021; Rash vulva started from 06Jan2021 to 10Jan2021; rash down her thighs started from 07Jan2021; Raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles started from 06Jan2021, whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy from 07Jan2021; itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see started from 06Jan2021; raised itchy area on her left cheek and eyes started from 07Jan2021; Headache dull started from 06Jan2021. The events Headache dull, itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see; whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy and raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles were reported as non-serious by the reporter and other events were considered as medical significant by the reporter. Investigation assessment for the events was reported as No. The outcome of the event anaphylactic reaction, inflammation in eye, welts was unknown, outcome of the event Rash vulva was recovered on 10Jan2021; of Headache dull, swelling eye was not recovered, of other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Rash across face, part of her cheeks over her nose; Arm sore; Received two vaccine within 10 minutes of each other and now to be re-vaccinated again the second dose; not enough research can guarantee if that&#39;s safe; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 60-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EL0140, expiry:Mar2021), intramuscular on 12Jan2021 at a SINGLE DOSE then intramuscular on 12Jan2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood cholesterol increased, fistula, surgery on 18Dec2020. It was stated, &#34;Sure, I am hoping you can help me. I am one of the legal guardians for our younger sister who has special needs. She is residing in a group home, group home in the city area she is currently been out of it because she has surgery. They have made arrangements for them to still ask for them to receive the first Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccination just this past Tuesday so I go from up there from my home in city and we had a problem in there they screwed up and ended up vaccinating her twice within 10 minutes. I asked the pharmacist, there I asked the RN what does that mean for her I mean I didn&#39;t know what that meant but normally we would sat for 15 minutes, they made her sat for 30 minutes. The nurse was there from the group home monitored her blood pressure and temperature and then we got in the car proceeded to drive 3 and half hour. They said just watch for temperature, labored breathing, take her to the emergency room call 911, the only thing she did have about an hour after she broke out that was &#34;malar&#34; (not clarified) rash across her face part of her cheeks over her nose that lasted for about 30 minutes. The next day her arm was sore which was going to happen but here is my question though she received two vaccine within 10 minutes of each other and now they are wanting her to be re-vaccinated again which would have been the second dose, supposedly on 02Feb2021. Nobody can tell me if that&#39;s safe or if that&#39;s okay, they can&#39;t guarantee, they all kept telling me, the nurse says, I called the pharmacist kept saying there&#39;s not been enough research to know if it&#39;s safe for her to get that next vaccine, so I don&#39;t know what to do.&#34; The reporter also stated, &#34;IM, Both went for IM, first one went into her left arm and second shot was given in her right arm.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: unknown result on an unspecified date, blood test: unknown result on 05Jan2021, body temperature: unknown result on an unspecified date, sars-cov-2 test: unknown results pre-surgery and post-surgery. The outcome of the event rash across face, part of her cheeks over her nose was recovered and arm sore was unknown.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 60-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL1283, subcutaneous on 20Jan2021 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, anaemia, blood pressure, cholesterol. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EU9899, in the left arm on 30Dec2020 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization and experienced swelling and redness at the site. Concomitant medications included liraglutide (VICTOZA), labetalol (LABETALOL), diltiazem (DILTIAZEM), valsartan (DIOVAN), rosuvastatin, metformin, aspirin and iron. The patient thinks that it wasn&#39;t given to her intramuscularly. This is a potential inadvertent subcutaneous administration of the BNT162B2. This patient received her second dose on 20Jan2021 on the side of her arm and reported that it was swollen, red, and hot, but has gotten 100 times better&#39; over the last 6 days since administration. She was asking for efficacy of the incorrectly administered dose. It was further stated that in the middle of the night, her arm was red almost like a little bullseye and she said that she was getting burning, and pins and needles down her arm, and a fullness in her hand like her hand was swollen. She said that she still kind of feels it. As the days progressed on day 2, 3, and 4, the swelling got more intense, the circular red swollen area got worse to the size of like a small baseball. She was feeling okay other than that. Today was day 6 and it was not as red and was more black and blue, swelling went down 80 percent, she still feels a little bit of the pins and needles and the fullness in her hand. She said that there was like a big knot that was very hot. It was a hard like knot at the injection site. The injection site was really big, round, hot, red, and had a knot that lasted; adds it is still there but 99% better; and she had tingling down her arm with pins and needles in her hand. She noticed it was little red a couple of hours, like 8 hours later; but by the next day it was circular, more red, swollen, itchy, and burning down her arm. By the third day, the site had a big, red, hard knot; still burning down her arm and with pins and needles down her arm. She added that her hand felt like a fullness in her hand filled with fluid. By Friday the swelling at the site was gigantic. The site swelling is improved but the redness was more of a black and blue now. Her arm has been very dark red, discolored, swollen, painful and has nerve pain described as &#34;hot tingling down the arm like pins and needles&#34; to her hand. She states that she has a very large knot at the injection site. This was in her non-dominant arm. She spoke with two of the pharmacists that she works with and they looked at her arm and both felt like she may have received the injection subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. The outcome of events was not recovered. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on the batch/lot number has been obtained.

On the second day after vaccination she developed chills without  fever followed by the appearance of rhinorrhea and sinus headache that persisted for about one week. As she has a past history of genital herpes and this resembled her prodrome for recurrence she self-administered valacyclovir for several days. On the eighth day after vaccination she noted mild hand tingling. The following morning she awoke with numbness and hyperesthesia of the left shin that is still present.There was no persistent tingling and no pins and needles sensation

She does report the reddened area is itchy.  She denies SOB, denies airway tightness, denies chest pain.  Her vitals at 1356 hours are a HR of 66, BP of 139/74, RR of 18, Sats 100%, RR 16.  Pt took a PO benadryl at 1347 hours per her request as she had already declined further EMS care (ALS and ambulance declined).  Her Sxs resolved by 1356 hours.  She stayed a few more minutes to be sure her symptoms were completely resolved and left POV at 1407 hours.   She will follow up with her physician as soon as she leaves.  She has been notified that her symptoms could return.

                                                The vaccine was not injected into the muscle as prescribed. The nurse pinched up the fat on my arm with a short needle. My upper arm swelled almost to the size of a baseball and was red and painful for over one week. I think it was administered SQ although intended to be IM.  I am a nurse and thought to myself at the time of injection that the proper technique for administering the shot was not followed, but thought perhaps I could be wrong and the extra swelling might be normal with the second injection.  My first injection was in left arm and did not swell and was only sore for a few days. If administered SQ, will the vaccine dose be effective?

                                                Received Pfizer COVID19 injection at 9:57 am on March 4 at the . As is usual for any shot or IV on me, I immediately tasted something weird in my mouth. It was not as metallic tasting as usual. More plasticy. Shot did not hurt.   Was told to stay in 30 minutes waiting area.I did. The taste remained in my mouth. I left at 10:34 am feeling OK, except for weird taste.  As I drove off the parking lot, I noticed that my mouth and tongue were tingling, with worst of it on my left side.  My throat did not seem to be affected, so I continued driving. Some nasal congestion and coughing.  The tingling turned into numbness in my mouth and tongue, all the way back to top of throat.  I called my primary care doctor at 12:10 pm and left a message.  I received a call back at 2:15 pm from nurse. She told me to take Benadryl and have someone take me to Urgent Care right away to get my vitals checked. I did not take Benadryl, as CDC said it could mask anaphylactic reaction.  I called a friend and she took me . I noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were swelling and painful.  We arrived at 2:45 pm. My vitals were checked, heart and breathing listened to and was checked briefly  for swelling in mouth and throat. There was no swelling. He said he had never heard of this tingling reaction and claimed it is just a side effect and not a serious reaction and that it would probably last a couple of days. He recommended that I watch for new symptoms and take Benadryl. That was $30. We left at 3:10.  We left. I noticed that the numbness was spreading to my lips and up the left side of face and I was getting super tired. Also, my mid to lower back started hurting a lot. I took a Benadryl.  4:30 pm still have same numbness. My eyes got super dry and itchy. My head started to hurt. Some coughing.  5:10 pm dry eye and numbness, more swollen lymph nodes and chills. Pain in calves, upper back, same on both sides.  6:38 weirdly, from the bottom of my thumb to halfway up my arm there is pain. Both arms simultaneously.

Everything else is the same.  8:48 pm jaw really aches. Intestinal discomfort. Going to bed.  10:39 pm pain from jaw extended up into left ear. Upper part of throat hurts.  March 5, 2021  4:00 am.

After dinner, around 7:30pm I noticed that my lips were swollen and the rash was spreading. Took one Benadryl and waited 1 hour. Condition worsened so left for ER around 8:45pm. Once there, I was diagnosed with an anaphylatic reaction. I was given Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intervaneously. The Benadryl injection caused my throat to close for a few seconds. Things calmed down so we waited an hour to see if I was responding. There was not a lot of improvement so ER doctor decided to use Epinephrine (EP pen injection). After 2 hours of observation, I was set home to follow up with primary care physcian.

A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes from about 3-4 years before, and an allergic reaction to the dye when testing heart - couldn&#39;t remember the dye put in. She was allergic to that and sent to the ER because her throat was starting to close up about 3 years before. Concomitant medications were none. Patient received the Covid vaccine and developed rash on 24Dec2020 that was worsening and she asked if there was any recommendation on whether this was it going to get worse. Patient received the vaccine and was very worried because she was really itchy in back and her legs were all rash and in her back. She was starting to itch really bad. This was after 2 days of the vaccine (on 24Dec2020). She didn&#39;t take note until it came to her back and her friend checked her back and told her there was a rash. She asked if this could be related to the vaccine. She asked was this a severe reaction and should she receive the next dose. Her second dose was scheduled for 08Jan2021. She did not know at this time if she would get the second dose as scheduled or not. Onset of rashes started on her legs; she thought it would go away; but the rashes had worsened; they were now on her back and were getting really itchy; she had a friend look at it who told her she had patches of rashes on her back. She reported that she was going to contact her doctor about this information because she was scared about the rashes. Outcome of the events was not resolved.  Lot/Batch and Expiration date has been requested.

Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included supplements. The patient experienced soreness and swelling at injection site, malaise and feels tired on 05Jan2021 08:00. She was scheduled for second dose a day later for COVID vaccine so after the 21 days to get her second dose. Patient is a Dental Hygienist. She received the first dose on 04Jan2021 and is scheduled to receive second dose on 26Jan2021. She should have it scheduled for 25Jan2021. There is no prescriber. She received it at a local hospital through her employer. They did not offer her the 25Jan2020, and said next day is 26 days. They told her there would not be any problem being a day late. She called back with a concern and had evening appointment with the intention of being 3 weeks later. She did it while she had 2 days off work in case she had a reaction. She was told it was not a big deal to get it 1 days later. She asked if she could go to a different location and they told her no, it had to come from the same batch and lot to receive second dose. She is just concerned about doing it a day before she has to go back to work because there are worse side effects with second dose. There is a 4 day grace period from what she read of of 17-21 days and not over 21 days. She is not sure if that is true though. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

The patient&#39;s medical history was covid at the end of Apr/May2020 with shortness of breath, seasonal allergies and allergies to &#34;some anitbiotics.&#34; The concomitant medications was reported as none, received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced soreness at site, redness and swelling, fever, nausea, general feeling of unwell 3 days. Patient stated, &#34;I had covid at the end of April/May with shortness of breath. I thought I would have less reaction from the vaccine. I know someone who was out of work for a while week after the vaccine.&#34; States that she read that the 2nd dose is supposed to have worse side effects than the first. If she had bad side effects from the 1st dose, will the 2nd be worse? Also asking if the side effects are the immune system reacting or just an allergic reaction. Patient was anxious about getting her second COVID shot on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that she had all the side effects listed, for three days. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t mind the side effects at the time, she had fever, soreness at the injection site, nausea, and a general feeling of unwell, but Patient stated that she could not work like that. Patient stated that her question was, statistically she has read that the side effects from the second shot are supposed to be worse than the first shot, but she was wondering, if she had bad side effects from the first shot, will her side effects be worse after the second, or will they maybe be lessened because she already had bad side effects. Patient reported that she did fill out the VSafe significant because she had to work on the third day after her shot, which was Christmas Eve, and work, was so busy and she did not feel well. Patient stated that she does have two days scheduled off work after her next injection, but it is the third day that she was worried about because she does not want to work feeling like that. Patient stated that the arm soreness started that same day (21Dec2020). At first, Patient reported that the arm soreness resolved, but then she states that it is still a little sore to the touch. So Patient confirmed that it is ongoing but improved. Patient reportsed that the fever started the day after the injection, 22Dec2020 and it has resolved. Patient reported that the last day she recorded a fever was on 24Dec2020. Patient  stated that she woke up on 24Dec2020 and her temperature was normal, so she went to work and she did not feel so well at work, but they were so busy that she barely noticed, and then when the Patient  went home that night, she took her temperature and it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient reported that the nausea started on 22Dec2020, which was mild at times, but then she got to where she did not want to eat. Patient reported that the nausea has resolved but she was not entirely sure when it resolved because she had been so busy at work on 24Dec2020, and it was hard to tell what she was feeling because she was non-stop busy that day. Patient stated that she was nauseous for a full three days, and she remembered that she did not eat much on the 24th either. So Patient stated that her nausea may have resolved on the third day after her injection, but it is unknown to her what day exactly that it resolved. Patient was also experiencing the general feeling of unwell from 22Dec2020 for a few days, but stated that by 25Dec2020 she felt okay. Patient also included that her left arm was also swollen, like her whole upper arm was swollen after the injection in Dec2020. Patient stated that she also experienced redness, there was a like a red mark that was further down her arm than the injection site in Dec2020. The outcome of soreness at site was recovering.  Patient confirmed that both the swelling and redness had resolved in Dec2020.The outcome of fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The outcome of general feeling of unwell and nausea was recovered on 25Dec2020.

                                                I had an immediate reaction to the covid vaccine within 30 seconds after the injection.  I felt a warm sensation after the vaccine in my deltoid muscle then felt it go up both my ears, around my head.  I then felt the same warm sensation in my abdomen, followed by buzzing of my entire body with light headedness.  I could breath, I could talk, but I had an urgency for others around me to know that I wasn?t feeling well and something was not right.  I asked my colleagues if someone could take me to the ER for monitoring.  They immediately put me in a recliner and elevated my legs.  This did not relieve my symptoms and asked to go to the ER.  I got to the ER and laid on the stretcher with continued increased buzzing sensation especially in my finger tips and arms.  My vital signs were 148/88 and HR 88 (elevated from my normal of 100-120/60-70, HR 60s).  The buzzing turned into a sensation in my arms that rumbled erratically.  I thought something bad was about to happen and that my blood cells would burst. Then I also felt icy cold in my arms and my gut.  Next what happened were teeth chattering shivers.  All these symptoms occurred in a matter of minutes.  They started an IV, drew blood, gave me Benadryl and ran IV fluids.  My vitals did not reflect what I felt inside, but as symptoms let up, my VS returned to normal.  As quickly as the symptoms started, they eventually calmed down and I was able to leave the ER in 1.5 hours to go home. I was very scared.  The ER doctor thought I had a hyperimmune response to the vaccine.

                                                Slightly sore left deltoid, cleared up in a few days.  16 hours after shot, experienced the dramatic sensation of tilting while sitting on a couch.  Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

About 11 hours after vaccination, I became increasingly uncomfortable, feeling warm, chills, muscle aches.  I could not sleep.  22 hours after vaccination, my temperature was 101 F (did not take it before this time).  Temperature waxed on waned from that point (day #2).  About 36 hours after the vaccine, my temperature stabilized to normal.  48 hours after the vaccine, I felt better and better with each hour.

                                                I developed mild itching of my right forearm and abdomen at 2100 but about 2300 I awoke with severe itching from my head to my hips--no rash.  1 Benadryl did not help, so about another 1.5 hrs later I took another Benadryl and that made the itching tolerable.  Having taken 50mg Benadryl I was not able to work at 0430 the  next morning as scheduled.  The itching continued even with Benadryl every 8 hrs until mid-morning of 12/30. I got the 2nd dose 1/20 &amp; --per the advise of my GP premedicated with 50mg Benadryl, 20mg Pepcid, and 1000mg Tylenol 45 min before the 2nd dose; then I repeated 25 mg Benadryl at bedtime.  I developed itching again about 8 hrs later but it resolved by the next morning and was not as intense as with the first dose.

Could not perform my work duties. Progressed to Rigors. Lasted at least 3 hrs in it&#39;s severest form. Now, 24 hrs later I still have some hand tremors, and legs are weak. Shoulder, knees, hips achy. I&#39;m very fatigued.  Right arm soreness @ injection site. All events were reported. I was sent home from work, had to be driven home. I rested, slept and hydrated the remainder of the day. Did not go to work today.

                                                (This is a duplicate entry. I mistakenly entered that patient received the Moderna vaccine, but she in fact received the Pfizer.)  I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my medical office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

                                                I am not sure this is what i shoud be filling out - just wanted to report what seemed like pretty bad symptoms on first dose by all info i have found. The actual shot was given by another facility than listed previously. I recieved the first dose of Pfizer at  Health Dept . No other location information was provided by them.  When i got the shot, a blood vein and possibly a nerve was hit. The nurse did everything properly i think to correct and notify other RN. It caused immediate pain in left fingers and arm felt heavy. That continued for days, but not too bad and injection site itself really was not very sore. My concern was how sick I felt starting within 6 hours of the injection and how long it lasted. I had pretty much instant nausea- no vomiting- mild but persistant, severe fatigue and general overall uneasy/sick feeling. Joint pain started within the 6 hours, along with a few odd pains in neck and right abdomen.  Was extremely chilled for hours, pretty bad tension /tight feeling headache, jittery feeling and foggy. I took a 500mg Tylenol about 8 hours after the shot, and it helped to relieve most symptoms to a degree that was nagging, but tolerable. I pretty much went through this for about the next 3 days and off/on to the 5th day

Took 2-3 hour naps every couple of days and slept 8-10 hours through the nights.  Headache off and on for 10 days.  Throat remained red, becoming most sore late afternoons, voice hoarse. On and off drippy nose.  On the 13th day I felt normal energy level in the morning but today, my 15th day at nearly 3pm, my normal energy is waning and throat becoming sore again.

MRA and MRI, no evidence of stroke, transient global amnesia, it took a couple hours for me to get back to normal. I also had a shingles outbreak 10 days post both vaccines.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Blood pressure high diagnosed a couple years ago. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) for COVID-19 immunization on 29Dec2020 and unspecified flu shot last fall, she thinks in Sep or Oct2020, but she has never had problems with those. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient called and said she had reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 12 hours after her second dose and wanted to report it. She said also this past weekend, on Sunday, on 24Jan2021, she started to develop a localized rash that has like a border to it. She added that she got her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021 at about 01:30 PM in her right arm. She said that she woke up the next morning, 20Jan2021 at 03:00 AM with a high fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and rapid heart rate. She said that the high fever that started the temperature she took was 103 initially, she says she took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and it came down to 101, and the next day it was probably 100 most of the day, then it broke that evening. She said the Tylenol, the dose was the extra strength, unknown if it was 500 mg, they were capsules. She says she normally doesn&#39;t keep it around, the in-house nurse suggested it so she went and got a sample thing and took a couple doses, she doesn&#39;t have it with her as she is at work and is not at home. She said that the nausea and vomiting subsided after the first day or second day, she had the on and off fever and slept most of the day both days. She said that she doesn&#39;t have a fever now. She said that she doesn&#39;t have her exact heart rate from when she was having the rapid heart rate, she just felt it in her chest. She added that the only reason she said anything was because she called in sick last week on an unspecified date in Jan2021. She said that the rash started developing after that and it is now probably the size of a 16 oz or 60 oz cup, unable to clarify number with caller, she said that it is definitely big but it doesn&#39;t bother her, though she is concerned it is there. She clarified that it is a couple inches in diameter and kind of looks like the state of (State Name), on her injection arm which was her right arm. She said her arm is not sore now, it was after the shot on an unspecified date in Jan2021, if she pressed where the injection was it is still a little sore. She said that the hospital said to report it. She said she also has a concern if she should she get another shot if they decide this is needed for more than two vaccinations. She said that she knows they are still gathering information at this point, so she thought she should better turn in, hopefully there will be solution later on. The outcome of the events localized rash, dizziness, heart rate increased and sickness was unknown. The outcome of the events fever, nausea and vomiting was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021 while the outcome of the event vaccination site pain is recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (, Solution for injection, Batch/lot no: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 15:00 in the left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously did get a flu shot in Nov or Dec2020. The patient developed a bad rash, hives, all over her body and itching on 10Feb2021. She reports, her feet were incredibly hot over the next 3 days on 07Feb2021. What started off as a few bumps kept increasing up to 3 days later. She was unable to sleep from being so itchy. Her doctor said it was an allergic reaction and prescribed an antihistamine after which it left in Feb2021. She was due for the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021. The patient did not had any investigation assessment. The patient states that there was little information out there to compare the experience she had. Wanted to call to make Pfizer aware of that and maybe get some more information out there. Has printed out the fact sheet and assumes she should not get the second vaccine because of what happened the first time. Wants to clarify what happened and share with Pfizer this information since she can&#39;t find much information for people who have had a delayed reaction. Went to get the vaccine on 04Feb and doesn&#39;t consider herself an allergic type person. Has no allergy to foods, medicines, only gets poison ivy and bug bites like most people. By Monday, the 4th day (08Feb2021) after getting the vaccine, noticed a couple of bumps on the wrist and does not know where else and didn&#39;t think of it as anything else. Thought it was a bite or she touched a plant and then it went away. It was not much. In the evening of Tuesday she had a bad reaction and on the 10th (10Feb2021) she had rash, hives, and itching that just moved to different places over the body. Her feet were so hot on the 3rd day and had to plunged them into cold water and used Epsom salt off and on and it helped some. This happened only for 2 nights and the reason she didn&#39;t go to the doctor, it went away. Again, mentions the first night she had a couple bumps and didn&#39;t think much about it. The second night, it was all over her body, the rash, and she took Epsom baths that helped, but she didn&#39;t get much more than an hour of sleep. She tried to take pictures of her thighs and backside, but unable to take good pictures, not a selfie person. The next morning she had her husband take pictures in case it went away and she went to the doctor they would have pictures to show. Her husband thought it may be shingles. Called the doctor on Thursday and had pictures to show her since the rash went away. Again, mentions the reaction was so bad on Wednesday. The doctor didn&#39;t believe areas on pictures of her back were shingles since shingles does not come and go away like that and that she must have had an allergic reaction to something. Provider didn&#39;t believe it was from the vaccine. Was given a prescription for Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg and was informed if areas didn&#39;t improve or returned she may need to see an allergist or immunologist. After the appointment she didn&#39;t get much sleep and woke up at 4pm in the afternoon and felt a little off, it could have been in her head or maybe she was paranoid, but she wasn&#39;t going to wait for the reaction to be full blown over her body and took one Hydroxyzine HCL and went to bed at 7:30pm and didn&#39;t do anything since. Got up and the reaction/rash, hives, itching was all gone after taking only one. It&#39;s like an antihistamine or Zyrtec. No further details provided. Later mentions after getting the first vaccine on the 4th, the next day she had arm soreness up until that Monday when the rash started. No further details provided. Says as far as recommendations were concerned for the paper she printed, the fact sheet. It says pretty much listed, she shouldn&#39;t have the second dose if difficulty breathing, swelling in the face and throat. The only thing she had was the rash on the neck, not the face. Paperwork also lists heart beating fast, or severe allergic reaction. The patient had no emergency room visit. The patient visited the physician office. The outcome of the event hot feeling in feet was recovered on feb2021 and rest of the events was recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 05Mar2021 1:45 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering. Outcome of BP dropped to 70/40 was recovered on Mar2021. Outcome of seizures recovered on 06Mar2021. Outcome of funny taste in mouth was recovered on 05Mar2021. Outcome of back pain was recovered on 07Mar2021. Outcome of bruised up was not recovered. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient provided an unrelated causality between the vaccine and event fall.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Fall is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

Medical history included high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis and kidney issues. Concomitant medication included insulin. The patient had the first COVID-19 vaccine. She had a lot of issues wrong with her, however she did not have them hit her at the same time. It was currently the 9th day since she had her first shot. About 4 or 5 days into it, the wound on her leg started to get worse. She had rheumatoid arthritis and she had an RA attack. She had herpes, but she did not had an outbreak in a couple of years. She got blisters in her mouth, and this also hit her. She explained everything hit her all at once. She was now on antibiotics for each one of the things. Her doctor figured out that her body just couldn&#39;t handle it. She clarified putting the vaccine into her body, she couldnt fight off everything. Like whatever in in the vaccine and how the vaccines works, her body was just not strong enough to fight off everything at the same time. The patient did not went to the emergency room. It was reported that the patient would receive her second dose on 03Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.      No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Patient presents 3/23/21 for medical monitoring of syncopal episode s/p COVID - 19 vaccine # 2.  Lowered to the floor by vaccine staff.  Patient reports symptoms of weakness, other wise states she &#34;&#34;feels fine&#34;&#34;. Two additional syncopal episodes witnessed by myself when patient attempts to change position.  Past medical history is significant for mild persistent allergic asthma, pre-diabetes, OSA, obesity and BPPV.  Patient reports history of same reaction s/p previous vaccine.  At a approximately 0837 patient was noted to have a worsening rash present to her face.  EpiPen administered via left lateral thigh at 0838.  EMS called to transport patient the ED for further evaluation.    Treatment administered: epipen (lot 0FM406, exp 02/22) left lateral thigh at 0838.    Upon arrival to the ED, patient&#39;s temperature is 98.8° F, heart rate 92-103, respiratory rate 30, saturating 99% on room air with blood pressure 164/91.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were largely unremarkable.  While in the ED, the nurse was getting ready to get the patient up to the commode when the patient started to &#34;&#34;not feel right again.&#34;&#34;  She asked her to administer the medications for allergic reaction and reports wall the 2nd medication was being infused, she felt paralyzed and unable to talk, although she was able to hear everything and was aware, she was unable to move or speak for a short amount of time.  CT head with completed at this time and showed no acute intracranial findings.  Chest x-ray unremarkable.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, heart rate 80 and prolonged QT at 470.  The patient was administered Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, Pepcid 20 mg IV, Benadryl 50 mg IV, normal saline 1 L IV.  Pt was admitted to hospital for observation.    The patient was seen on the unit laying in bed with her husband at the bedside.  She reports that she is feeling slightly better and hungry and has never felt at paralyzed/unable to speak feeling before and is very nervous about this.  She was wondering if she had a seizure, although she reports feeling aware the entire time and did not lose bowel or bladder function. We discussed that that is not typical for a seizure, but even if we did an EEG at this time, it would not be able to tell us what occurred in the past.  We discussed continue the Benadryl, Pepcid, and IV steroids for today and likely decreasing them tomorrow. We discussed the workup of syncopal episodes as well. The patient and her husband were agreeable to this plan.    Patient was discharged from the hospital on 03/24/2021 in a stable medical condition.  Patient was instructed to follow-up with her PCP in 1 week.

She talked to her husband and he advised her to take Benadryl so she took two Benadryl. On Wednesday she had some soreness at her injection site. Very early Thursday morning she noticed a golf ball sized knot in her armpit. She said it was sore and if she rubbed it, it felt like it was pushing into her breast. She said it felt like pressure going all the way to her breast bone and along her esophagus. She ended up calling EMS and her blood pressure was up to 181/107 and had a high heart rate. She said she never had any hives but did have some throat, tongue, and lip swelling and said that her throat felt raw. The EMS gave her 2 nitroglycerin tablets and 5 aspirin. She spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital. She said the hospital did all kinds of cardiac tests on her and everything can back clear besides a leaky heart valve. She said she is feeling much better now and that the hospital was not sure if it was a reaction to the vaccine, something else, or a combination of things that caused it.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that the patient vision wasn&#39;t as good. She also had glasses to read (eyeglass wearer and ongoing) and behind her eyes they were dry one (left) mostly. Concomitant medications included unspecified beta blockers. On 11Mar2021, she got chills on the same day. Right as she got the shot, she wanted to vomit also and got shaky. On 12Mar2021, she woke up with whistling in her breathing for a few minutes then it was done. At the same moment, her eyes were changed eventually. She had mucus in my eyes as her vision wasn&#39;t as good and behind her eyes, they were dry one eye (left). So, watching TV wasn&#39;t as good and became bothersome. She later noticed, the black in here eye was taken up most of her eye (as if her eyes were dilated). Her eyes and hearing were sharp also now sharp as she was reading better (without my read glasses) and had to turn down the volume in her TV. She also felt like she was getting hemorrhoids for a few days but then it went away. She also had black stool, then constipation (harder stool) eventually went the day right after the shot (12Mar2021). Then around 5pm, she had feeling like she had too much sugar and was dry which she needed water. Once she sat down, her living room door seemed like it was so much further away, stairs the spindles were larger in size, it was if she was high on something. It was different nothing but this injection. She was also experiencing a feeling of peace and calm. As if nothing was wrong, no stress (stressing about something) she couldn&#39;t even think of- everything was gone, a calming effect. It was high feeling. The next day (13Mar2021), she had a super watery bowel movement then went into clay like and drier consistency but still dark (she never had stool this dark). In Mar2021, she also stated that there was a movement under her skin like a pre-herpes or a pre-shingles. She mentioned that she knew herpes and the movement under her skin was shingles feeling. Her skin was also extremely dry. On 17Mar2021 (a week after the injection), she woke up to my heart spasm. It was beating real fast (beating like right under her skin), no pain and heart attack but more than a heart flutter. She didn&#39;t know whether it was going to beat or stop. She also woke up with a loud whistle (louder than before) out of a dream. She stated that during the day she doesn&#39;t get the stressed, but in her dream, it was magnified and woke up in a violent vicious fury. She had 3 nights of this (uncalm coming into my dreams viciously, morbidly gross) started on 14Mar2021. The heart spasms come as a few seconds and goes away but that&#39;s happened twice which it scares her. She also stated that there was feeling of hardness in her lower abdomen and heart area (belch) in Mar2021.  The injection almost reversed her beta blockers (which keep it in the 50s) it went to 79 (same as it was before she started taking beta blockers) but her blood pressure was normal 121/something (that was a good thing). She also mentioned that her energy was so much more while other people woke up early, cleaning up -would get sleepy and a little tired. But this (injection) gave her energy. Her injection site for the first 2 weeks also had an itch, that would come up (not constant) almost like a yeast infection which had an extreme itch. There&#39;s pain was there on touch (no throbbing pain) it took over a week before it was gone. She also mentioned that the chills were off and on for 4 days. The vaccine also did something to her weight as she was expecting to lose weight, but she didn&#39;t. One day, she gained 3.2 pounds then the next day lost 3 pounds. Her tooth also broke (but no pain in her tooth) even she had a sensation of her teeth being weak which she could feel it. Her tooth broke eating a tortilla chip and that&#39;s weird. She wanted to know if other people had called in with the symptoms that she had experienced. The patient recovered from breath sounds abnormal and constipation on 12Mar2021; cardiospasm, chills and vaccination site pain in Mar2021 while the remaining events were unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. Information on the lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

It hurt; sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose at the age of 61-years old via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 10:10 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus from 1985 and ongoing, arthritis and osteoarthritis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She has osteoarthrosis throughout her body and her feet). Family history included stroke (husband died at the age of 59, he was having stroke upon stroke). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  It was reported that when she received the shot, it was given high on the top of her shoulder and it hurt. She could not move her arm for 3 days. The pain was excruciating. On the 4th day, her arm was sore, but she could move it. She had no fevers, she didn&#39;t get sick, but she just couldn&#39;t move her arm. The shot was given at at 10:10 am, and by noon she could barely move her arm. Her left side of the mouth doesn&#39;t want to work properly. Her Bells Palsy started on 05Apr2021. She was in her car and driving to the store, when all of a sudden her left eye was watering. She got home and she didn&#39;t see anything wrong with her eye, except it was watering. She could tell a difference between the left and right side of face when she touched it. Something was wrong with her right side. Her eye was not opening all the way, it&#39;s been dropping, and her lip was down. She can&#39;t smile, and when she drinks water it&#39;s comes out. The patient clarified that it was her left side that is drooping. She went to the emergency room due to Bell&#39;s palsy. She could not move her arm within 2 hours of getting the shot. The patient mentioned her whole body aches from the Lupus and arthritis, but the shoulder pain was different after the vaccine. The shot itself hurt, and she thinks the one who administered the vaccine might have hit something. There&#39;s not a day that doesn&#39;t go by that she is not in pain. Her platelets are 200, which is very low. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included activated partial thromboplastin time: unknown result, blood glucose: unknown result, computerised tomogram: unknown result, full blood count: unknown result, glomerular filtration rate: unknown result; all on 06Apr2021, magnetic resonance imaging: showed a darkened area in her brain that looks like its connected with Bells Palsy on an unspecified date, basic metabolic panel: unknown result on 06Apr2021, platelet count: her platelets are 200, which is very low on an unspecified date, prothrombin time: unknown result, troponin i: unknown result (High sensitive ); both on 06Apr2021. The patient did not recover from Bell&#39;s palsy, recovered from vaccination site pain on 23Mar2021, from sore arm on 19Mar2021 and the outcome of the remaining event was unknown.  Information about Lot/batch number is requested.

It was reported that 09Apr2021- got her 1st Pfizer COVID shot. Left arm. Felt okay afterward, got a little tired later on. On Sunday, she woke up w/an earache on her left side, which moved down into her neck - near her lymph nodes. Later, her neck started swelling/itching/stinging/feeling warm, and it hurt her throat to swallow anything. She went to get Benadryl and anti-itch creams, but they didn&#39;t work. The neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse, and at one point it felt like her throat was swelling and getting narrow, and she wondered if this was one of those anaphylactic reactions. So she took 2 Benadryl, and that seemed to help. That night she couldn&#39;t sleep for the neck heat, itching and throat pain. Monday AM (12Apr2021), she took her temp, which was 100.2. She did a Teladoc Zoom so the doc could see the situation, and he said that it could be a severe vaccine reaction, or some kind of infection. He prescribed prednisone &amp; clindimycin. The rash left scars, which are peeling. Ae resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Prescription drugs. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                starting developing hives on back of my neck and head  6 days after the covid vaccine was administered. The hives progressed to my ears, arms, abdomen, groin, and upper thighs. I started taking Benadryl the first evening the hives started and continued benadryl for 2 more days. The benadryl did not stop the progression or  help much with the intense itching.  Had a telehealth visit via the telephone with Dr on Monday Jan 4. He ordered  Atarax prn. I also started taking Pepcid and Zyrtec. Today I still have hives that are developing but at a much slower pace. The itching is much improved.      DO I TAKE THE 2ND VACCINE?

A 62-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 28Dec2020 at 14:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included environmental allergies, she has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume, blood pressure (abnormal) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn&#39;t have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn&#39;t know if it was later that day. She can&#39;t remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn&#39;t have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn&#39;t want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn&#39;t as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn&#39;t hurt as bad, but she can&#39;t remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She&#39;s been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don&#39;t give it to her anymore. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn&#39;t want to get the next one and have a worse reaction. She is not sure if she should be worried. The events of swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm were assessed as medically significant. Outcome of the event of &#39;swelling of fingers&#39; was not recovered, the other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event joint pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

                                                My body had started itching  and I didn&#39;t know why.  I had not eaten anything new or changed any shampoo or soap. Finally on Thursday night I realized maybe it is the shot that is giving me all the itching. My whole body was flushed I kept scratching my arms and legs, especially  around my ankle, knee, under arm and goin area.  I took an allergy pill  and called Kaiser and spoke with an advice nurse. she   mentioned that taking an allergy pill will relief some of the itching.   I fell asleep around after midnight normally I go to bed around 9:30.  I also called pfizer and explained and the person took all my information and symptoms.

A 62-year-old female patient started received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for an unspecified indication. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  As reported, patient asked, &#34;should I get the second injection of the COVID-19 vaccine since I have this cough that will not go away?.&#34; This female nurse, who was also the patient, reported receiving her first injection of the PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE on 18Dec2020. She started to develop a cough after the injection that did not improve and had worsened by the end of the second week. Treatment has included cetirizine (ZYRTEC), dextromethorphan (ROBITUSSIN),Guaifenesin (MUCINEX) and albuterol inhaler. A chest x-ray showed some inflammation on the lungs and she was given a steroid inhaler, which has helped. She has received two COVID-19 tests at different time intervals, and both were negative. She was scheduled to receive the second COVID-19 vaccination on Friday but was uncertain if she should receive it given her cough was not improving. She had a bad cough, and other symptoms just before her injection (pending clarification). But her general practitioner (GP) put her in a steroid inhaler. She talked to her GP but can&#39;t give her complete advice as to whether she can still take the 2nd dose or not due to her situation. She said she had very slight pain in her arms after taking the vaccine, and felt a really bad headache on 18Dec2020. She would like to know if she still needs to continue the 2nd dose of vaccine or not since she still has a cough. Patient asked if there was any guidance on getting a second dose and what if test was a false positive and she really did have COVID-19?. Outcome of the event &#34;She started to develop a cough after the injection that did not improve and had worsened by the end of the second week&#34; was  not recovered while &#34;A chest x-ray showed some inflammation on the lungs&#34;, Slight pain in her arms and Bad headache were unknown.   Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                Almost immediately after the injection, I noticed a metallic taste. It was mild enough that it did not interfere with the taste of foods or drinks. It was noticeable whenever I had not had anything by mouth for a while. This lasted for 2 to 3, maybe 4, days.  Soreness at the injection site, and stiffness of the arm, began the evening after the injection.  Warming applications and moving the arm relieved these symptoms.  They were gone the next day.

                                                I had my first vaccination on 1/11/21 at HD. The reaction was typical- significantly sore red inflammed arm over deltoid muscle that resolved after 3 days. Second dose given 21 days later- some swelling and soreness, low grade fever. Then 3 days later, I awoke, turned in bed and experienced an intense shearing pain in my neck and arm. The pain was the worst ever felt, and was not improved with NSAIDS, Acetaminophen, Hydrocodone, or Tramadol. I went to an urgent care center on 1/16 where a tentative diagnosis of sprained neck was made. The sypmptoms continue with slight improvement with steroids, and a muscle relaxant. I am concerned because I understand that covid itself can impact the nervous system considerably.  I am awaiting improvement in symptoms and if none seen then I will see my primary care MD

She had no difficulty breathing, no swelling and said she &#34;felt fine&#34; except for the itching.  She took Allegra about 1:30 pm.  We recommended she call her husband to come and take her home and to go to ER if symptoms progressed.  She declined. At about 3:00 pm redness was improving on upper arm but had spread down to the palm of her hand.  Again she stated she felt fine. Patient drove home on her own about 4 pm but agreed to text Nursing Supervisor when she got home.  She reported at about 7 pm that she was greatly improved.  Follow up today (1/21) itching/redness is gone but does have body aches and headache.  Her only known past allergy is to Sulfa drugs. No issues with first dose. Let employee know that if there is ever a reason for another covid vaccine that she would have to have it done in the care of a doctor&#39;s office.

                                                The next day after the vaccine my arm was red and really painful.  Each day the redness got larger and by friday it was near my elbow so I went to an Urgent Care.  I was given a prescription for an antibiotic because they states infection had set in it and I also took tylenol and antihistimines to help with the pain.

My blood pressure was checked and it was elevated.  I started to have difficulty breathing. They transferred me over to the ER. They gave me IV medicines Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid (I think). After 6 hours I was able to go home. Everything went back to normal besides the pain in the left arm at injection site.   I had a telemedicine visit today with my primary care physician to follow up.

                                                The vaccine was injected too high in left arm. I know this because I am a retired pharmacist and when I removed the bandage noticed injection was near the shoulder and not in the mid deltoid area. The left arm/shoulder began to feel sore in the evening and was very sore the next day. Was unable to lift arm or move without pain. Over the next several days the severe pain decreased, but I continue to have pain in the arm, especially the bicep area. Range of motion is limited. Severe pain when trying to lift my arm from resting position while in bed. Severe pain when rotating arm inward. Pain occurs with certain movements.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at 13:30 on the left arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included partial seizures complex, asthma, beginning of heart disease and high cholesterol all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient stated she has a rash on the top of her hand right hand and rash on the left hand; it is real dry, it looks like dryness, on 18Jan2021. The patient stated that she doesn&#39;t know if it is allergic reaction. She needs help to figure it out. She is asking if she needs to see her doctor. The patient stated that otherwise, the vaccine was healing her and helping her. She stated that she knows you can have a rash all over your body and she wants to know if that is going to happen. She clarified she noticed the rash on the top of her right hand - not the palm. She isn&#39;t sure if it came from taking out the trash or cleaning stuff or some other reason. She stated that it is now trying to get on the other left hand too. She said you can&#39;t really tell it on her left hand but she noticed it on the night of 18Jan2021. She is unsure if when she washes her hands it is getting from the right hand onto the left hand. She just needs to know if it is from the vaccine or if she needs to stop taking out the trash or maybe wearing gloves. She is scheduled to receive the next dose on 5Feb2021. She lives in a senior facility building. One of the staff members got COVID so they had to get the vaccine. The adverse event did not require a visit to the physician or emergency department (ER). The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 15Jan2021 12:53PM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the Pfizer vaccine. Medical history included allergies/allergy from childhood 4 years old, back problem from 2001, back surgery in 2015, vaginal dryness, high cholesterol, depression, acid reflux, surgery in 2015, physical therapy, and allergy to mold, dogs, roaches. She has multiple allergies from childhood including allergy to mold, dogs, and roaches. She also mentioned she has had back problems since her first surgery in 2015. All of these predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine and Lipitor. She got to where she couldn&#39;t stand up straight, but she went to physical therapy. She had surgery in 2015. She had a problem in 2018 and they gave her shots and that helped. Family history was none. Concomitant medications included estradiol (ESTRING) (for three years) for vaginal dryness, fish oil (taking for three to four years) for high cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL) (taking for 20 years) for depression, cyamopsis tetragonoloba gum (BENEFIBER FIBER SUPPLEMENT) (using for a year), vitamin d3 (VITAMIN D3) (using for five years; she used to be on calcium but it can cause heart problems so her doctor told to take Vitamin D), dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) (taking for five years) for acid reflux, (ALLEGRA) (taking for 5 years ) for allergy, (QNASL) (using for 3 years), allergy shots (used forever) for allergy and stool softener (taking for 5 years) to &#34;keep things moving&#34;; all were from unspecified dates and ongoing. The patient previously took atorvastatin (LIPITOR) for high cholesterol from 2017 to 2017 and experienced back pain from 2017 to 2017 (recovered). She also previously took calcium. The patient experienced &#34;received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 15Jan2021 at 12:53PM in the left arm/ she noticed a sore arm right afterward&#34; on 15Jan2021, lower left side back pain on 20Jan2021, and rash on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient called to report a problem with her lower back after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine. &#34;I&#39;ve had surgery and a couple of shots, the CAT scan kind. I have been fine for a while, just had a sore arm and yesterday I noticed a problem with my lower back and thought it may have been because I painted, but it is still bothering me. I remembered when I went on Lipitor I started having problems with my back about 3 weeks in, same deal. The doctor took me off and I went back on a month later and I started having problems again. Because I don&#39;t know if it was the vaccine, I am wondering if I should get the second dose.&#34; She clarified she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 15Jan2021 at 12:53PM in the left arm. She noticed a sore arm right afterward which lasted at least 48 hours. Then on 20Jan2021, she noticed lower left side back pain. Mentions she thinks it is at the L4 or L5 and this is the same place she had a shot there in 2018 for back pain and previously had surgery on that location in 2015. With regard to Lipitor, she is unsure of the exact year, but states it was probably back in 2017. After taking Lipitor she noticed her back pain coming back. Her doctor took her off of Lipitor for a month and it got better. Then he put her back on Lipitor and she had the same back pain problem. She stated that she is unsure if she will take the second dose and asked with regard to her back pain should she take the second dose. Outcome of  &#34;received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 15Jan2021 at 12:53PM in the left arm/ she noticed a sore arm right afterward&#34; was recovered on 18Jan2021, outcome of lower left side back pain was not recovered, while outcome of rash was unknown.

                                                Arm was sore at injection site for about 24 hours then the next day severe arm pain started. Within a few days it was painful to move my arm backward, upward and forward. The pain lasted over a week; I contact Primary Physician and he recommended ice and acetaminophen. I did that for several days and by day 10 it was spreading to my shoulder area and radiating down my arm. On 2/25 I went to urgent care (primary is 50 miles) and then my Primary is preparing consult for Ortho.

For the past 3 years I have been medication free and virtually symptom free.  The symptoms of the last few days are consistent with those I had during the years when my MCAD  was active.  I am concerned that the vaccine has reactivated the hyper-sensitivity of my mast cells.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

A 62-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982, expiration date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shingles which she contracted in 2019, about one and a half years ago, it was a shingles on her back and lower back which she stated were the worst place for shingles has attacked, it left her with severe pain in both legs; diabetes; and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included losartan, atenolol (a beta-blocker), and metformin for diabetes. The patient took the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and after about 2-4 days (Jan2021), she had a little chill and got very tired. She had to take care of herself. She was very tired not realizing it was the shot she took. She also felt like she has no energy. The patient was working from home but a lot of times, she was lying on the couch. Over the weekend (Jan2021), she had a slight pain on left arm. About a week or 8-10 days later (2021), she got very tired and couldn&#39;t even sit up. Her body was not itself. She started to feel like a bus rolling over her, like somebody took a baseball bat and beat her really bad. The patient uses her arm a lot and her hand started to feel a lot of pain. She couldn&#39;t even touch herself; it was so sensitive. She took paracetamol (TYLENOL) but it didn&#39;t work. She had celecoxib (CELEBREX) an anti-inflammatory, she thought she was maybe inflamed, but it didn&#39;t work. She had some diclofenac cream, she rubbed it, but it didn&#39;t work. The patient had shingles about a year and a half ago which was very bad. She just felt weak and didn&#39;t feel like herself anymore. She had a little bit of nausea and her whole body was really terrible. When she had the shingles, it left her with severe pain in both legs. She saw a neurologist and told her that she would have to take pregabalin (LYRICA) and it would go away. So, when she had severe pain last week, she took pregabalin but it didn&#39;t help. The patient took half of acetaminophen, oxycodone (PERCOCET) as she was not the person who takes pills, but it didn&#39;t work. Her body was so severe on Friday, it was not going away, the pain was there 24 hours. The patient has been experiencing this for 8-10 days now. She took one PERCOCET on Friday and had a slight relief and didn&#39;t took anything again. She kept rubbing the diclofenac cream, but it was not much of a relief. This morning, she has to work, she was sitting so she took PERCOCET. She is getting her second shot on Friday, 12Feb2021. She asked how she will feel after the second dose if she felt that way after the first dose, if the first shot was adequate, and if she should take the second dose. She stated that she didn&#39;t want to take the second dose. Her body felt so weak including her fingers and hand. It triggered the shingles pain in her back and felt like she was beaten up by someone. She has to lie down for the pain in her back. She also mentioned that she couldn&#39;t sit for so long as her waist and back were so painful. She was lying on a heating pad and ice and nothing was working. She even has a hard time getting up. She thought what happened was it triggered the shingles pain in her back and also left her with a problem under her feet. The shingles left her with some kind of damage when she took the shot. It was really bad. Her son was a physician and was concerned because last week, it got so bad, she didn&#39;t come out, she was in bed and bedridden from Friday to Sunday. She had no appetite, she didn&#39;t eat. The only thing that the patient had was diabetes and high blood pressure, but it was under control. She just checked her pressure and its was 130/80, and now, because of the pain, it went up a little bit, but before my pressure was like 120 something, over 68 or 72 it was always around the 60s and 70s. Since she was having this, it was a little high. The outcome of the events was unknown.

This 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Feb2021 at 12:00 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was unknown. Concomitant medications were none. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks or other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced fever 103 white posture on knee that turned into cellulitis and lymphadenitis. The patient had IV antibiotics twice within 5 days of vaccine as treatment for events. The patient still had swollen from groin area down to knee. AE resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had no covid prior vaccination, no covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event cellulitis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2 based on the information provided. The event onset date is not reported, therefore the drug-event temporal relationship is not clear. In addition, the BNT162B2 vaccine was administered in the arm but the reported cellulitis was at knee area. It is very unlikely that the cellulitis was related to BNT162B2.

                                                Soreness injection site; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: unspecified product and adverse event. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program. A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 23Dec2020 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Medical history included penicillin allergy and anaphylaxis to a penicillin type drug. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took ampicillin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) from an unknown date to an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced drug allergy.  On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced soreness at injection site. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The clinical outcome of the soreness at injection site was recovered in Dec2020 after about 48 hours. The reporter considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the soreness at the injection site was related to the vaccine.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                On Friday, January 15 at approximately 6 PM while seated in a reclining chair watching television I started to develop hives below my right gluteal fold. Over the next six hours  approximately 300 hives appeared on my skin. They were very itchy. At approximately midnight my lip began to swell and being a certified registered nurse anesthetist,  who lives alone, I knew it was time to head to the ER. Prior to going to the ER  I  cleaned the lesions With alcohol, took prednisone 10 mg PO,  and applied hydrocortisone cream.    In the ER, I was given Benadryl 50 mg PO and Pepcid 20 mg and observed for one hour. The hives remained but there was no respiratory compromise. Approximately six hours later the hives were still increasing in size and number, were unbearably itchy and my swollen lips had not subsided.  I took Claritin 10 mg PO and returned to the same ER and was given Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, prednisone 20 mg po and observed for three hours. The hives did not decrease and again there was no respiratory compromise so I was sent home on prednisone And a H-1 blocker.  Of note, both my palms and lips have been bright cherry red.     I finished a five day course of Macrobid on January 13 at 10 AM.    Final diagnosis:  Alergic  reaction

                                                The following day after patient received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine, the area around the injection was light red, warm to touch and painful. The area was approximately 2.5 inches around.  On Sunday 1/10 it was bright red, indurated, hot to the touch and much more painful. It was also painful to move his arm.   On 1/13, the injection site was still tender to the touch and his shoulder area was sore with movement. Over the next couple of days his shoulder into his bicep had a dull ache and was very painful to any pushing, pulling or weight bearing. Ibuprofen did help but did not relieve it.   On 1/17 patient went to a local urgent care because at that point it was even difficult to sleep due to pain. They diagnosed him with bursitis of the left shoulder due to SIRVA. He was started on a steroid pack and today, day 2 of steroids it feels slightly less painful.

A 63-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176/expiration date) dose number 2 intramuscularly on 08Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital. Medical history included severe allergic reaction to pecans and tinnitus. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (dose number 1, intramuscularly on the left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced tinnitus, sinus infection, and stuffy head after the first dose. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks and no other medications were taken within 2 weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post-vaccination. On 08Jan2021, after the 2nd dose, the patient experienced itching across shoulders/back of neck and sl nausea. She took Benadryl which relieved the itching. She went to bed and had onset of body aches, chills, and sense the she couldn&#39;t get a good breath. She felt like there was a tight band around chest. Her O2 Sat was 95% - 98%, with pulse of 101-129, T max was 101.8. The symptoms were lasting about 6 hours. In the morning, the patient took Aleve and Benadryl. Most symptoms were alleviated. She took those meds scheduled for 48 hrs. She noticed that if she tried to push past scheduled time, the itching started to return, so she just kept the meds scheduled for 48 hours. No other symptoms after that. She added that she had tinnitus, and she noticed that both injections made that worse. It was not yet subsiding since last injection. The patient also received Tylenol for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021.

She stated that it helped with the pain. She said that she was getting conflicting information and stated that she heard that there have been more symptoms associated with the second vaccine. She wanted to know if it was contraindicated for her to take the Aleve after getting the second dose. The patient described it as discomfort and stated that she gets it with the flu vaccine too. Aleve helped with the discomfort and the ache. She did not pre-medicate. She took it afterward. She stated that she took maybe 1-2 doses of the Aleve the next day and stated that by the end of the next day her pain was fine. The patient clarified pain was at the injection site and was achy. She said that she received the first vaccine on 02Jan2021 in the morning. She noticed the pain later in the day around midafternoon and said that it was gone by the next day. The outcome of the event pain at injection site was recovered on 03Jan2021 while outcome of muscle aches and discomfort was recovered on unspecified date in Jan2021.

Then my lower lip began to swell.  I would consider these symptoms somewhere between mild to moderate.  The symptoms began around 4:30 in the afternoon and subsided as the evening progressed.  The next morning (today), my face feels basically normal again.  My only symptoms now are a sore arm and a slight headache.  I have experienced allergic reactions before but never from a vaccine.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Mar2021 16:32 (Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to Sulfa drugs, Penicillin, and believes she has allergies to Ploymers (She cannot wear polyester and she has to wear 100% cotton). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient (at the age of 62-year-old) previously received the second dose of Shingles Vaccine in Jan2021 for immunization. The patient experienced really bad headache, excruciating headache on 09Mar2021 21:00, nauseous, nausea/queasy on 09Mar2021, she had soreness in the arm on 05Mar2021, blurred vision on 09Mar2021, holes in her vision on 09Mar2021, not right on 09Mar2021, like an allergic reaction on 09Mar2021. She developed a &#34;really bad headache&#34; around 9pm on Tuesday 09Mar2021, that caused holes in her vision and pain &#34;straight across my forehead&#34;. She did treat with Tylenol and was able to finally sleep around 5am. She states that the headache has persisted, and she&#39;s felt &#34;nauseous, queasy, and not right&#34; since the headache started.  She is hesitant to get the second dose. She was experiencing headache following. She mentioned she is allergic to sulfa drugs, penicillin, and polymers, and thought maybe the headache was a result of an allergy to the vaccine? Ingredients don&#39;t appear to have any of her reported allergens. She had soreness in the arm the first 48 hours, which was to be expected and no big deal for her. However, starting on Tuesday, she had an excruciating headache. She normally does not typically get headaches. She believes in vaccinations and as a teacher the minute she could sign up to get one she did. Now she is terrified to get the second one. When this excruciating headache began she woke her husband up to tell what happened. She thought she was going to die, that is how bad it was and she wanted him to be aware and prepared if anything should happen. The excruciating headache started at 9PM. It was excruciating all night. The headache made her queasy because she hurt so bad. It continued into Wednesday. Today and today the pain is duller in her head, much duller than it was. However, she still feels queasy/nauseous. The headache also started with blurred vision. The blurred vision has gone away. It was like there were holes in the TV. She was thinking  it was interesting and did not think much of it at first. She thought one of her contacts had a hole in it, but she did not even have any on. The blurred vision lasted 24 hours. The soreness in arm lasted until Sunday or Monday. She confirmed the pain in arm is gone and was gone by Monday. She initially could not wait to get her shot. Now she is terrified to get the second one. She took Tylenol in the middle of the night on Tuesday and Wednesday for the headache. Has allergies to Sulfa drugs, Penicillin, and believes she has allergies to Ploymers. She cannot wear polyester. She has to wear 100% cotton. She is questioning if the vaccine has polymers in it. From what she heard it does and is wondering if this caused her to have like an allergic reaction. The outcome of the event vaccination site pain was recovered in Mar2021, the events Nauseous and headache was not recovered, other events was unknown.

She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021.

Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER2613 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration administered in the arm, on 23Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included breast cancer survivor. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that she was trying to figure out what to do. On 26Mar2021, her arm started to swell a little bit. When she woke up, it woke her up at 5 o&#39;clock in pain and her shoulder was kind of swollen, it has got big old knot and it was red and it was apparent itchy and she could not scratch it so, she thought about it and she got an ice pack, so she put ice on it. She was holding ice on it now, trying to sooth it. She was wondering where she would go for reaction, she knew she had reaction like this before so she had a side effect from it, and her arm was kind of still stiff and sore. She did not go to the emergency or urgent care because she looked at left and she looked at the right and like she said, it was swollen and she got big old knot and it was red. She also stated that she did not take Tylenol today. She did not know what she wanted to get through to somebody and she needed to speak to somebody on what she needed to do. She also said that on an unspecified date in Mar2021, in her stool, she found some blood. She had another appointment with her &#34;thyroid&#34; (not clarified) and she does not know the results yet. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                has possible atrial fibrillation; Arm would get hurt; her arm felt like a bruise; irregular heart rates; She&#39;ll have  a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night.; When probing for specific event information she reports it&#39;s kind of like she coughs a little more and she is a little more short of breath and it&#39;s happening more often; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 63 years, via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 04:06 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma, hysterectomy, dark chocolate or red dye (she starts coughing and has an allergic reaction and shortness of breath), bursitis (in her right). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin, experienced allergy and had really ad hives (several years ago) she was given a cream to put on. She had to get another medication and she doesn&#39;t remember the name. That medication made her dizzy and she couldn&#39;t even get out of bed so they had to half the dosage. When she had her hysterectomy she learned she couldn&#39;t take any types of &#34;cillins&#34; medications. The patient had been watching her heart rate with a device and since getting the Covid 19 vaccine she&#39;s noticed her heartrate was always higher than it normally is. Her heartrate was going crazy, the device was not recording right. She reports that for the last 2 days the device has been telling her she has possible atrial fibrillation. This is worrying her. She doesn&#39;t feel anything different. She was usually hyper. Her resting heartrate was higher. Normally her resting heartrate was in the 80s (beats per minute) Now it&#39;s going up to the 90s (beats per minute) then her heartrate drops to 40 something (beats per minute) Then the device said her heartrate was 118 and 107 and she&#39;s not even doing anything. She hasn&#39;t even worked out yet. She doesn&#39;t like to take medicine. Medications don&#39;t work out with her. She had a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night. It was reported that she feels fine. She has no other symptoms. She&#39;s been reporting online. Clarified she&#39;s reporting online through the V check through the CDC. She&#39;s been trying to get the Covid 19 vaccine forever. She did research on all the Covid vaccines and she felt more confident with the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter was against the Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter thinks the vaccine was just going to kill her. She reports she was healthy and she works out 6 days a week.  She recently tried to get a CT scan for her heart. Her husband&#39;s cardiologist recommended her husband have a CT scan of his heart and she decided she needed a CT scan too. She&#39;s also watching her heartrate on her watch. Her husband&#39;s heartrate is completely normal and stable on the device so she knows the device isn&#39;t messed up. It was also reported that the device will tell her she has too much muscle movement and she&#39;s standing completely still. Then she&#39;ll get the device to record her heart rhythm and it goes sporadic. The device tells her 90 beats per minute at resting then over 100 beats per minute. Her heartrate on the device was going up and down a lot. When she&#39;s been watching the device record her heart, it looks like it&#39;s going crazy. Her heartrate goes way up and way down like in the 40s (beats per minute) She noticed when her heartrate is in the 40s (beats per minute) and she&#39;s never had her heartrate go down that far, it&#39;s really really weird. She thinks maybe she&#39;ll get back to normal. She keeps watching hear heartrate. She reports she noticed her heartrate right away on Saturday evening after she received the Covid 19  vaccine. Her heartrate was higher than normal for resting, it was in the 90s (beats per minute). Her resting heartrate is usually in the 60-80s (beats per minute) and it was the in 90s.

A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Apr2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as many medical conditions, names unknown, just a combination of medical problems. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications, some of which were taken in the morning. The patient had the vaccine on 02Apr2021 (reported as &#34;Friday or Saturday&#34;) in the afternoon and had a bad adverse reaction to it. The patient had swelling in the face, hives on her back, itching that was in her back, and, allergic reactions on 02Apr2021. Due to these, since she was just in a medical facility, doctor and nurses over there were able to inject her with Benadryl that was a strong dose, in a long needle given into the muscle and stuff. It was good enough that she got up and was sent home. She then seemed to be fine but on Monday, 05Apr2021, she couldn&#39;t get out of the bed as the pain all the way down to her back was killing her, like it was paralyzing her. She could not even get out of the bed for like hours. The neck and back pain on Apr2021 were pretty intense, and she does not know where and how it came so she was trying to figure that out and realized she just recently had the vaccine injection. She knew that there could be some kind of reaction, but she was not sure if it were from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure she did not get something serious because she already has rare conditions. She added she did not have any prior treatment for these because she did not even think like this was even a side effect of the Pfizer vaccine but now she was wondering if it was because she had not taken anything prior. She does not know if it was related or not and she was concerned about it. She wanted to know what she could do if these were side effects because she knew there were some people that have something to do with the spinal cord and she was not sure if their symptoms were like hers or not. She wanted to know if she would need treatment for it and if it was an adverse reaction. She added that the swelling in her face and, itching that was in her back went away the same day when she was given the vaccine. The outcome of the events swelling in the face and itching that was in her back was recovered on 02Apr2021. The outcome of the other remaining events was unknown.

                                                Vaccine was administered on 12/30 at around noon.  I felt fine that day but was aware that a previously diagnosed but inactive area of contact dermatitis on my right knee was flaring up - becoming very pruritic and active.  Over about 48 hours it became red, blistered and eventually weepy.  The area had been biopsied in September of 2020 (&#34;spongiatic dermatitis&#34;), treated with topical steroids and for the most part resolved.  I saw my dermatologist on 1/6 - repeat biopsy was done (&#34;severe allergic reaction&#34;) and it was treated again with topical steroids and is resolving.  On 1/12 I began experiencing generalized pruritus.  I have patchy erythema, dermatographism, and a few scattered solitary urticarial lesions.  There are no respiratory symptoms - specifically no shortness of breath, cough, bronchospasm, swelling of mouth, lips or tongue.  No joint pain.  No fever.   I took zyrtec 10 mg with minimal improvement.  I contacted my dermatologist today who feels this is an Id reaction and suggested reporting the reaction to VAERS.  I have also contacted my primary physician and have a telehealth visit scheduled.  The biggest question is whether to have the second dose of the vaccine, as I am a physician actively seeing sick outpatients.

This 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 06Jan2021 13:00 on left arm at single dose (Lot # EL1284) for COVID prevention. Medical history included ongoing arthritis in some form probably since 2011 (reported as ten years ago, as of 07Jan2021), ongoing Osteoporosis had it probably at least since five years ago, maybe longer, ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus had it probably since 2016 (reported as five years ago, as of 07Jan2021) High cholesterol this is managed or lowered with medication, and was diagnosed in 2001 (reported as probably 20 years ago, as  of 07Jan2021) her whole family has it. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM at age of 64-year-old on right arm at single dose (Lot # EL0140) for COVID prevention. She says that the first time she got the injection in her right arm, but the second time her right arm was still hurting, which she has arthritis over there also, this time she got the injection in her left arm. She says that the soreness or sharp pain under her left ear could be or not be related. She experienced soreness to arm injection site. She says that the area below her left ear doesn&#39;t feel swollen, it just feels like not a sore throat, but every so often she has a sharp pain, and it could be that she slept on it wrong. She says she was wondering if that goes away fast or is connected, like a possible side effect. The patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine 06Jan2020 13:00 and reported to have a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear on 07Jan2021, sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes. She read that swollen lymph nodes were a side effect and is asking if that area is a lymph node and would that be considered a side effect and is asking how long it will it take before it goes away. She is wondering since side effects said might have lymph node swelling or something. She says in her arm where her shot was given is sore, and also kind of right below her left ear, which she thinks that is where a lymph node is. She says every so often she has a sharp pain there that goes away, and she wanted to know if this could be a part of it, since she is guessing that is where a lymph node is, or wondering it this is something even related that could be a side effect. Treatment included she took Tylenol Rapid Relief Extra Strength a while ago, dose queried but not provided. EXP: Jul2022, LOT: SJA072, this is not on the bottle, it must have been on an outer box which was discarded. Treatments received for the events pain, pain in ear, vaccination site pain and swollen lymph nodes. Outcome of the events were unknown.

A 64-years-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), intramuscular on deltoid left from 30Dec2020 to 30Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included contact dermatitis. There were no concomitant medications. The reporter stated that the patient had mentioned that she had contact dermatitis for several months now and before taking the COVID-19 vaccine, it has settled within a month. 6-12 hours after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, her contact dermatitis had worsened dramatically on 30Dec2020. She was prescribed high dose topical steroids by her doctor. She also developed generalized itching and isolated hives on 12Jan2021. She is trying to avoid systemic corticosteroids because it might affect the vaccine. She is also taking antihistamines but she said these interventions don&#39;t seem to be working. Stated that it has not responded to anything. The patient also stated stated that she has not taken steroids because her second dose is due in a week. Stated that the doctors do not think that it is due to the vaccine but due to reactivation (immune system reactivity) of something that had happened. Stated that they are treating it with high dose topical steroids, pepcid and hydroxyzine. Wanted to see if there was information on this sort of reaction and if they had guidance on the second shot. Had the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine. Outcome of the events urticaria and pruritus was not recovered while outcome of the remaining events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported generalized itching and isolated hives occurred 13 days after the first dose of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2.  Based on the reasonable temporal association, the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events and the administration of the suspect. However, the pre-existing contact dermatitis might have provided alternative explanation towards the onset of the events.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

She read that the lymph nodes could swell under the arm on the side, the shot was given and it did plus the area were sore, this was on 10Jan2021. On 12Jan2021, in the morning, is when she noticed that in the lymph area and going to the outer breast there are red splotches. It was not tender or warm to the touch and she can tell it will fade on its own but she thought it was weird. It might have been there the day before; she didn&#39;t really look. Currently there was still soreness with the lymph nodes but she would have to press to feel it, she would say that was over. She has a picture if needed of the red splotches. Patient stated that she is healthy for her age. She has no medical conditions or takes no medications. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of the lymph node pain was not recovered while for the other events was unknown.

Her daughter got her some diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) within that 15minutes and about 20-30 minutes of taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride it was calming down. Patient only took 1 diphenhydramine hydrochloride to help and that took care of it. This was the only occurrence. Her face was really swollen and red, she looked like she was sun burnt, skin was blotchy, but she didn&#39;t have any trouble with breathing or heart palpitations. The event onset date was 16Jan2021. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room/ Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Outcome of the events was resolving.

                                                Shortly after the vaccination I developed a really bad headache for the first 2 days.  Stopped for a day and returned for another day and went away on its own. I had inside body chills, felt weak and tired and had a little sinus pressure but no fever which lasted for about 2 or 3 days.  I took aspirin to help with the discomfort and today I still have just a little nagging headache that comes and goes but all other symptoms has since subsided.  The injection site swole and developed a knot which stayed about a week and is still a little red.

Complete muscle, joint, entire deep body. WORST i ever had. then a few welps and even though 90% was under the skin rash husband and I could feel the 10 % was red, small pimple like IF not the neck welps and then on the 4  day  had a few hives on face only.  Worst itching I have ever had and I have had chicken pox and antibiotic rashes. I think the problem has been came off of antibiotic and gradually got ok but can not get this out of system so easy of course. Today is 1 week. rash is better but not gone and itching is some better but still not good. I did not take benadryl or anything since I DO NOT want to interfere with me getting as much benefit from the injection since I now can not have number 2.

                                                I developed a severe rash that traveled throughout my body after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  It started 3 days after the dose as a rash and within 12 hours it spread to hives and then covered my entire chest, back, neck, arms and face - my ears became swollen.  Over the course of several days, the rash spread down my torso and down my legs.  The rash turned black and blue in certain areas.  It was very itchy.  I was seen at Hospital ER, seen by a dermatologist,seen by an allergist and seen by my primary care phsyician.    I was treated with prendisone,  Hydroxyzine, Benadryl and Zyrtec.   I was required to get blood work to check my platelets and liver.    Doctors report that this was an allergic reaction.   After the one week the rash subsided, and at this time although it is not fully resolved,  the rash does not make me uncomfortable.

Have not been on any medications for the CRPS for over 2 years with minimal to no exacerbation of CRPS events. I have a long history of flair ups with insults to my body (e.g. post accident, post surgery, extensive dental work).  The numbness and burning started to return within 2 hours of injection to the right side of my face and my right hand.  Then these symptoms started to return to other locations on my body throughout the week (lower back, left knee and right ankle).  The only site that has subsided 1 week post injection is my right hand though all symptoms have not resolved there either.  The burning in my lower back got so bad on Thursday that I had issues sitting and scheduled an appointment with Dr. for Monday 3/1/21. Telehealth visit with Dr. this AM and returning to medication to treat CRPS/RSD till episode resolved.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm (at the age of 64 years) on 24Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes (borderline about 15 years ago/started taking a medication a year ago for her high sugar numbers/had some blood tests, her A1C was normal, her diabetes was the same way it always has been); hypertension from 2012 (diagnosed about 9 years ago); sleep apnea from 2020 (uses a C-PAP machine/diagnosed approximately a year ago); Epstein Barr from 1995 (diagnosed when she was 39); high cholesterol (sometimes she didn&#39;t take her medication for that); cataract and cataract surgery in Jan2021 (had this last month/they used anesthesia/didn&#39;t know which type/had some eye drops for this). Concomitant medication included an unspecified high blood pressure medication (she thinks she tried a few times). The patient called about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and she had questions and side effects. She did get one shot, and was not due for her second for a couple weeks. The patient felt sick since she got it, some side effects have been less, some stayed the same or got worse. Her skin was burning up, her arms, her face, her stomach, her back, and her chest were burning up. She has done no treatment, because she didn&#39;t know what to do to treat it and it was difficult to be able to get in to see a doctor. The burning skin has probably gotten worse. She also had nausea and no appetite, though she has gotten a little better, it has been at least a full week or so. She had a headache and a bad sore throat also. She got home from getting the shot, probably maybe 5 or 6 hours after getting the shot. The patient&#39;s weight was 145-150lbs. The outcome of the event skin burning sensation was not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

                                                As the needle was being inserted and while the vaccine was being injected, I immediately felt intense pain like none I&#39;ve had during any prior vaccine administration . The needle was inserted very high on the arm about 1/2 inch below the shoulder.  About 4:00 pm that afternoon, new pain developed in the same shoulder, along with very limited range of motion, gradually worsening during next few hours. By 9:00pm the pain was excruciating, like there were multiple knives in all directions in my shoulder. By then I could not lift or move my arm any amount in any direction without excruciating pain.  I suspected a severe inflammatory response. This pain level continued for the next 2 days.  On the 3rd day the pain was a little less severe and I had slightly more range of motion, but was still unable to lift my arm without pain. On the 4th day (Feb. 18) the pain was a little better but I still had severe sharp pain if I lifted my arm in certain directions. I began to suspect a torn muscle or tendon. Today (March 5, almost 3 weeks after the vaccine), the pain and limited range of motion are the same as Feb. 18.  It is relieved only by complete rest of the arm, and easily aggravated by any basic activity (grocery shopping, dressing, etc.)  I believe my shoulder was injured by improper administration.

She was scheduled to take second shot now and was trying to find in research about taking the second shot inspite of having covid. She cant find anything, most of the people never heard this and primary care physician said to go ahead and take the shot, but some people and some researchers said you should not, because she might have symptoms later and she should wait. The treatment was not received for the adverse events. Outcome of tested positive for Covid and 6 days was unknown and for other events it was recovering.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6206), via intramuscular route of administration, in the right arm on 05Mar2021 09:30 (at the age of 64-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing rheumatoid arthritis, anaemia, cardiac disorder, rash (She has had a reaction to IVP dye. She has to pre-medicate with benadryl and a steroid 10 hours before, then 8 hours before, then 1 hour before procedure prior to receiving IVP dye. When querying NDC/Lot/Expiry for IVP dye, caller states she does not have that information, it happened years ago. She always pre-medicates when she has to have have x-rays with the dye). The patient did not have history of all previous immunization with the BNT162B2 vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). Concomitant medications included tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR) via oral route of administration from an unspecified date (been on for 2 years) and ongoing at a dose of 11 mg daily for rheumatoid arthritis; ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) for an unspecified indication; tramadol (TRAMADOL) via unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at a dose of 50 mg daily (in morning) for rheumatoid arthritis; gabapentin (NEURONTIN) via unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at a dose of 300 mg twice daily for rheumatoid arthritis and Multivitamin for an unspecified indication. The patient previously took buprenex and experienced drug hypersensitivity, buprenex and experienced nausea and vomiting, avelox and experienced angioedema. The patient did not underwent any Lab tests.The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than BNT162B2 Vaccine prior to the event being reported.The patient did not received any other vaccines around the time of BNT162B2 vaccination. She was calling about the Covid vaccine. She had her first dose this past Friday, clarified 05Mar2021. It&#39;s been a week. On the evening about 8 hours after the Covid 19 injection she got a rash on her shoulder that she had the shot in. The rash went across her chest to the other shoulder. On her neck she had hives up to her face and down her chest a little bit. She has been taking Benadryl for the past 6 days. She is very concerned what is going to happen with the next dose. She contacted her primary health care provider and it was recommended that the caller pre-medicate. The caller states it says not to pre-medicate. She has her next Covid 19 vaccine in 2 weeks and she was nervous. She did file a report with the government. It was in the information she received from the hospital where she got her Covid 19 injection. Every day at 2:00PM she gets a text message. They monitor her for up to a year. Every day she checks in and says how she feels, is she having trouble completing daily activities, did you have to call your doctor. They gave her a paper at the hospital where she had it done. When querying if this government program had given her a report number she states she doesn&#39;t have a report number, she deletes the text messages every day. She is due for the second Covid vaccine on 26Mar2021. It was reported that several hours after the injection in the evening, maybe 8 hours after she had the injection is when her symptoms began. She does feel like she is improving. Today was the first morning that she didn&#39;t take the Benadryl. She had no respiratory problems. But she was very concerned because the hives were pretty prevalent. It was very uncomfortable. She was taking 50mg of Benadryl for 5 days. When she went to the pharmacy to pick up a cream too, the pharmacist thought that a steroid would be good. She was concerned. She emailed her primary care doctor with pictures. When querying seriousness of events, caller states it was bad enough that she went to the pharmacy and called her primary care doctor and sent her pictures. If she had developed any respiratory issues she would have gone to the emergency room. If she was non medical she would have gone to the emergency room but because she&#39;s a nurse she thought she would ride it out. When querying information for the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine data capture aid, the caller reports the hives were 48 hours later. She also reports urticaria, her head and ears were itchy. She is using steroid cream on it. It is driving her crazy today. Still going to be using the cream. A little bit of erythema, worst part was her neck. When querying red and itchy eyes, she reports only the eyelid. When querying gastrointestinal issues, she reports she has diarrhea, but she has gastrointestinal issues. The diarrhea is nothing worse than what she normally has. She doesn&#39;t think this has anything to do with the vaccine. The patient did not visited to emergency room and physician office. The patient was not hospitalized or admitted to an intensive care unit. Therapeutic measure were taken with Benadryl 25-50mg (Lot Number:P134952, Expiration date: Sep2021) and Hydrocortisone cream 1% maximum strength for the events. It was reported that Benadryl makes her hyper and her heart racey.The outcome of the event diarrhea, gastrointestinal issues were repoorted as unknown, event head and ears were itchy was not recovered and recovering for other events. The events rash on shoulder that she had injection in, hives on neck, rash on neck up to her face were assessed as serious (medically Significant) by the reporter. The causality of the events rash on shoulder that she had injection, hives on neck, rash on neck up to her face were reported as related to vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

You want me to break it down like what the time and what the affect was? Okay 11 PM on Friday 18th my hands swelled up, they were red and they were itchy. I couldn&#39;t get the itching to stop. Hand cream or cold water they finally subsided with cold water and I was able to get sleep. Then I woke up Saturday, 19Dec2020 at 6 AM then was my hands, my feet swollen, red and itchy. Itching was just like, I did not know what to do about it. Used cold water and that rested for about 4 hours. After that stopped I had a rash on my arms, my leg and my abdomen and it just came out of nowhere. It was red like a bubbly rash like a size of pea. You think I looked at I thought what I was going to do. I went I got a cool shower another 4 hours that subsided not completely but enough where it wasn&#39;t scary anymore, it was bearable. Closer to dinner time I had Lymphadenopathy under both arms, red, swollen then I took another 4 to 5 hours to subside. During this I have sore arm that was slightly swollen. The arm was swollen, the shoulder was swollen and the clavicle area was also swollen and that&#39;s my reaction. I work in healthcare and I was just at a point I went to work, I reported the incident and I filed a VARIS report. I talked to my administrator she said I should call Pfizer, let them know. I spoke to my primary doctor, to let him know. I just wanted to report this to someone.&#34;Registered Nurse stated, &#34;My work place.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1686) on 06Jan2021 07:30 via intramuscular at left arm at single dose for some other people who have had COVID and she didn&#39;t want to take any chances (because of her age and knowing she works in the medical field). Medical history and concomitant medication were none. The caller states she works in healthcare, clarifies she is a medical assistant. She is calling in regard to Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine. She received her first dose on Wednesday and she was having no side effects until last night. Her arm started getting hot in the area where the injection was. Her arm began to get warm, red, and was swelling (07Jan2021 21:00). She took a couple of paracetamol (TYLENOL, lot number: SHA101, expiration date: Jun2024 at 500mg) and put an icepack on it. However, this morning, her arm is still the same. Caller wanted to know if she can still continue to take paracetamol and use the icepacks and just give it some time or what. She knows the redness, swelling, warmth are some side effects but she wanted to just follow-up to see if she can continue to take the paracetamol. Caller verifies she received her first vaccine on 06Jan2021. Last night, 07Jan2021, around 9 pm, she started to get the warmth, redness, and swelling. She states her arm looks the same as it did last night. However, her arm is beginning to itch (08Jan2021). It wasn&#39;t itching last night. She explains the vaccine was available to her. She took it because of her age and knowing she works in the medical field, she is around a lot of young people and patients, and also for her family and friends. She knows some other people who have had COVID and she didn&#39;t want to take any chances.  None of additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Event was not required a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Relevant Tests was none. Patient was not recovered from the events.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 29Dec2020 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing diabetic, and metal and copper allergies. Concomitant medication included unspecified regular medications. No other vaccines were administered on the same date. No vaccinations were received four weeks prior. On 10Jan2021 23:00, the patient reported that she broke out in a rash under her skin that was so itchy. She noticed the rash around 11PM and had been taking Benadryl around the clock. She can still see the rash on her skin, it was not raised or bumpy, but it itches like crazy. She clarified the rash was located on both of her arms, trunk, chest, back, and neck. She believed the COVID-19 vaccine was related to the rash that was itchy that she was having. She cannot think of anything she has done differently to cause this itching. It started Sunday and at the time of reporting, it was Thursday and she still had it. She stated she was trying to go to the doctor to be looked at, but no one called her back. She has been taking Benadryl around the clock from the beginning of when it was needed. It seemed like the Benadryl has not phased her at all as she was wide awake. The next dose was scheduled for Monday 18Jan2021 and she did not know if she wanted to get the second dose of the vaccine. The vaccine was given at a hospital, not military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or to the physician&#39;s office. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included rapid COVID test: negative on 13Jan2021. Outcome of the events was recovering. The events were reported as non-serious and related to the suspect drug.

                                                About 1/2 hour of the vaccination, I felt mild tingling of the lips.  Very gradually, that got worse (over the nest few hours) and I had tingling of hands and feet.  I gradually developed facial swelling (my lips were enlarged and felt firm, as did my nose).  I checked my pulse ox, and it remained above 97%.  I never had rash or trouble breathing.  But  about 5 hours after receiving the immunization, I took some Benadryl, and over about 1/2 hour I could feel that things were improving.  Over the next 24 hours I took Benadryl again two times, due to return of the tingling sensation of my lips.  I also felt very cold, and had a hard time getting warm.  This also improved with the Benadryl.

                                                Injection site very sore; arm swollen; Feverish; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 21Jan2021 at 10:15 (at the age of 65-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFIB), shellfish allergy, allergy to pain medications, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and COVID-19. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications, taken within two weeks of vaccination, included amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), spironolactone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and esomeprazole magnesium (ESOMEPRA). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced arm swollen and feverish on 21Jan2021 at 19:30 and injection site very sore on 23Jan2021. The events were reported as non-serious. It was reported that the injection site was very sore on the third day. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, which included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and icing arm. The clinical outcome of injection site very sore, arm swollen, and feverish was not recovered.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of  bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient thinks she could have COVID last Mar2020. She was not sure because her doctor&#39;s office was close for around a month and she couldn&#39;t get tested. There were no concomitant medications. On that day, 19Jan2021, after she received the vaccine she started feeling pain in the injection site, joint pain, muscle pain and fatigue. On 25Jan2021, she was feeling pretty bad, she doesn&#39;t want to eat, her back hurts, she&#39;s irritable and depressed. The patient would like to know if these side effects could be associated with the vaccine in someone who had the virus. She felt awful and she felt like she has gone right back to where she was 8 months ago, 10 months ago and started over with fatigue and everything. It was awful. She thinks she could have had COVID in Mar2020 and the symptoms she was having now, she had then and when she has had basically the whole time and that would just come back worse. There was no treatment received for the events. The outcome for the events was unknown.

She takes thyroid daily (as reported) as it was removed when she was 20.  The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient has not received any vaccine in 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included teriparatide (FORTEO) daily injection, diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergies: codeine. The patient reported that no one knew if she should inject with teriparatide. On 22Jan2021, she received teriparatide at 4pm and bnt162b2 at 7pm. She took a diphenhydramine and had some itching, ongoing soreness and lump at site. She took teriparatide at 3:30pm at about 7pm she was nauseous and vomited. She had chills but felt better afterwards. She went to bed and have headache, not sure if she should discontinue teriparatide or discontinue before next shot. According to the reporter, the events started on 23Jan2021 19:00; vomited started on 23Jan2021 21:00. The outcome of the event was recovering.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine I lost complete hearing in my left ear. I waited until the next morning to see if hearing would return. It did not and I contacted my doctor at the Clinic and was referred for an audiology test on Thursday at 9:30am followed by a appointment with an ENT. My hearing loss was profound and I was started on high dosages of steroids for a 14 day course of action. I also had a head MRI done on Monday February 8 with no significant findings. My hearing has begun to improve but at this point is not back to normal and it may never be the same. My biggest question is whether or not I should take the second vaccine. I also have a significant bruise at the injection sight that I still have 10 days later.

                                                On February 11, 2 days after my vaccination, I woke up with pain and swelling under my left eye.  Over the next 2 days, the left side of my face under the eye experienced redness and swelling then subsided and localized into a large stye on the lower left eyelid.  Now,  a week later, the stye is still red and pus filled but has improved and is slowly resolving.   I would not normally think that this affliction had anything to do with getting a vaccine but it does seem strange that something like this could occur in someone who is very healthy and and does not experience any side effects from vaccines.   The last time I had a stye was in my 20&#39;s and it wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as the one I am now experiencing.   Since the Covid vaccine is so new and however unrelated this coincidental affliction seems, I thought I should report it regardless.

I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EL9263/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 65 years old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included allergic reaction to almonds and brewers yeast in Sep2019, being pre-diabetic, and osteoporosis. The patient had allergies to codeine (all forms), almonds, brewers yeast, mold and dust. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included metformin, alendronate sodium (FOSAMAX), and multivitamin, other supplement. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 23Jan2021 at 15:15, the patient experienced that her cheeks were red and hot. The clinical course was as follows: because of a prior significant allergic reaction (Sep2019 determined to be primarily almonds and to a lesser extent brewers yeast), she waited 30 min. and she didn&#39;t notice anything until she left the property and removed her mask. Her cheeks were red and hot. She had a diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) tablet (OTC) which within 30&#43; min reversed it. The outcome of the events cheeks were red and hot was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

She then had a rash that started on the left side of her neck, went towards the back now.  This started a few days after the vaccine, all on the left side.  She also got a cold sore on her lip which she had all the time as a child, but not as an adult, which has pretty much resolved.  She has been cold, chills and some dizzy spells.  She did get a bump on her head concussion in December.  One day last week she just stayed on the sofa with a blanket due to feeling poorly.  3 days ago on her back by her shoulder blade an area has been really sore.  She did take some Tylenol for the back pain which did not help so she stopped this.   She did not call her doctor.    The rash is still there but not as intense.  It has not itched, but she has felt it.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 on left arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included chronic kidney disease. The patient had chronic kidney disease and its real important for someone with her disease to get the vaccine, because if she got the actual virus it would hit the kidneys hard. The patient had no positive covid or antibody test prior to the vaccine. Concomitant medications were none. The patient stated that only thing she thinks would be related was that, she noticed this rather after using the hot tub, her husband just cleaned the hot tub and put chemicals in it, maybe she had a reaction to chemicals used to clean the hot tub. On 24Jan2021, the patient was reported after 10 days the patient had rash was up under the arm, near the arm pit, in the same arm of injection but there was no rash at the actual injection site, however her skin was beautiful, there was no spot except under the armpit. She got the injection a week ago Friday, she noticed the rash days later, on Sunday with itching under the arm. The Dermatologist says it has nothing to do with vaccine. The patient also had a slight headache a day or 2 (on 15Jan2021) after the shot, not a migraine, it was a slight dull headache, but went away. The patient went to the dermatologist yesterday, and he said it had nothing to do with the vaccine. She went to the dermatologist on 26Jan2021. Caller again stated that there was no rash at the injection site, but there was a rash underneath the arm in the arm pit. She still has it, she just started to use medicine last night. It&#39;s getting better. The Dermatologist prescribed a topical cream and its some kind of cortisone. The patient did not have any severe reaction like head swelling or swelling. The patient was scheduled for her second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient recovered from headache on 16Jan2021, recovering from rash, and for itching it was unknown.

Both sides of my neck turned pink as though I had a sunburn. Broke out in profuse sweating.  Called my doctor who was on call that night. He told me to get Benadryl  right away and to keep taking it until symptoms subsided. If they did not subside or got worse I was to go to urgent care, or ER.

She said her symptoms started brewing up from day 1, clarifying that her symptoms were not really bad until 30Dec2020 and 31Dec2020. She clarified on 30Dec2020 she took Naproxen, Ibuprofen, and Tylenol for her symptoms, and nothing helped her. She said she knew her symptoms were not normal for her, and she went for the whole month of Jan2021 with her symptoms. She said finally there came a time when she said &#34;oh no, this is not normal at all&#34;, and she told herself she needed to check in at the hospital. She said she took Naproxen and Tylenol, and felt a little better, and drove herself to the hospital. Reported she kept walking and taking medicines, and while at work she diverted her mind from her symptoms, but when she came home she felt tired, and would tell herself she couldn&#39;t do it anymore.

She said fluid resuscitation was the only way to bring her CPK levels down and to treat the rhabdomyolysis. Reported her symptoms have improved. She said her last CPK was 134 on Wednesday, 17Feb2021. Reported she had cramps and severe muscle spams in her right leg on 17Feb2021, and then had cramps and muscle spasms in her left leg the following day. She said the cramps and muscle spams have not gone away completely. Reported she has a small petechia rash on her lower legs. She said at the moment the petechia rash shows up on her leg, she knows she is going to have a muscle spasm in that area. She said last night she had 2 petechia rashes show up on the lateral side of her right ankle. She said the petechia rash started to burn, and her right leg calf muscle became heavy. She said she could tell her right leg calf muscle was going to start to spasm, so she took some coconut oil and applied the coconut oil to her right leg calf muscle and massaged her right calf muscle. She said she had 2 areas of petechia last night (23Feb2021). She said the first time the petechia was noticed was when she went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021. She said the petechia has been persisting since that time. She said prior to being admitted to the hospital she never had dry skin or itching, but now she has dry skin and itching. She said she was using coconut oil to keep her skin moist. She stated she had 2 telehealth calls (11Feb2021 &amp; 18Feb2021) because of a petechia rash and muscle cramps and was asking her doctor is she may need to go back to the hospital. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work, CBC and Thyroid level on 06Jan2021 with unknown results (she had regular blood work done for her yearly checkup on 06Jan2021 (BMP, CBC, and Thyroid level).

Outcome of the event rhabdomyolysis, fatigue extreme/felt tired, myalgia, pain and her cpk was over 2400 was recovering. Outcome of petechia, muscle cramps/muscle spasms, dry skin and itching was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded.

I took 2 Benedryl tablets and experienced symptoms for the next hour. They subsided by 5:30 pm . I was able to breathe and swallow during the whole episode. I had very similar reactions several times in June when I was for unknown reasons experiencing hives and had same response when prescribed Bactrim, and then Keflex because of a UTI. I had no further incidents with the chest, throat, mouth reaction since mid June until yesterday.  I had no adverse reaction to the vaccine until 3.5 hrs after receiving it. I feel this is because my body has some sensitivity, not that anything was done incorrectly in administration of the vaccine. All personnel were very attentive and careful that I observed.

First noted a painful, firm, pea-sized pink area exactly 24 hours after receiving dose #1 of the Pfizer vaccine (1/15/21, 6:15PM). Within 24 hours this enlarged to ~ 4cm, remaining firm, red, tender, subdermal. It is gradually reducing in size as of 1/22/2021 (1-week post-vaccine), now ~2.5 cm, but still very red and painful. No fluctuance or break in the skin. No other symptoms (fever, rash, etc). Concern for immune-mediated granulomatous reaction.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that she had her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on Saturday, 16Jan2021, with no side effects. The patient stated that she had read in the past that taking 1 ibuprofen before and after the flu vaccine was recommended. She said she also had medical people tell her the same. She recently read a study where it is recommended a person shouldn&#39;t take ibuprofen before or after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine because the ibuprofen might interfere with the vaccine&#39;s effectiveness. She said she is now in a bit of a quandary moving forward, as to if she should take any kind of analgesic, or Ibuprofen, or anything of that nature before getting her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She took 1 Advil prior to receiving her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She wanted to know if she should not take any ibuprofen before her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. The patient reported further that on 16Jan2021, she had a tiny bit of soreness in her arm, only if she touched the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. She does not experience any soreness if she moved or lift her arm. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EL1284) , via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal, cholesterol abnormal.  Concomitant medication included atorvastatin for cholesterol abnormal, warfarin sodium (COUMADIN).  The patient stated that, &#34; I got very bad rash it kind of looks like hives in my upper chest and in my neck area but that was like maybe 11 days later (17Jan2021) and I went to urgent care and they gave me prescription for prednisone, which is cleared it up but then I saw my primary doctor on Monday the 18th and my primary doctor recommends that I should not get the second vaccine, which I have an appointment for on Thursday and I am very confused, I don&#39;t know this is the reaction from the Covid vaccine. I just I am very confused and I would like feedback if I could get some, did anybody recorded any kind of allergic reaction like 11 days later, I got the first one I am due for the second one. I went to urgent care and they prescribed me Prednisone and Zyrtec for 5 days.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was resolved on an unspecified date.

A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues. Traveled by car a couple  thousand miles last year and no issues.

                                                She received her 2nd shot on 2/20/2021.  Within minutes she noticed that she could not see, due to localized swelling around her eyes.  She began to feel itchy and her tongue felt swollen.  She was taken to ED and was given Benadryl and Solu-Medrol, her symptoms continued and she was administered epinephrine about an hour later which immediately cleared up her symptoms.  She has some residual generalized itching and has been taking Benadryl 50 mg every 6 hours until 9:00 p.m. yesterday.  She also takes Zyrtec 10 mg daily starting yesterday.  She denies having any dizziness or lightheadedness, hives urticaria, nasal congestion, weepy eyes, diarrhea or abdominal cramping.  She does endorse nausea and was administered Phenergan in the emergency department.  She also endorses that her eyes felt itchy.  She also endorses that she was able to swallow.   Takes celebrex but paused this prior to the vaccine to prevent possible anti-inflammatory interrupting vaccine efficacy.   Her ED record is available for review.  Exam findings endorse she is tolerating secretions, speaking in full sentences and her tongue was not enlarge. No labs were drawn during her visit.   She denies historical reactions to vaccines. She does get itching with some medications. Historical angioedema/urticaria post pistachio and bran muffin were singular events and have not recurred. She had a normal tryptase in 2014

Just thought it was my eczema flaring up (it&#39;s worse in the winter).  After about 2 weeks, developed red areas on my body (torso, arms, legs and feet)  - self-monitored - but got progressively worse.  Dermatologist believes it is eczema aggravated by the vaccine.  Provided  a cortisone injection (right arm).  Will monitor for two weeks to determine improvement or lack of improvement.

It came and then it went away, then it came back again twice that day.  Each day it would come and go and would leave hives on her body. She took Benadryl and then started having ankle issues, and then a ball formed on the bottom of both feet, which lasted for several hours and went away. She went to the hospital yesterday 2/23/21 and broke out into hives again and then went to the hospital as her PCP did not have an opening. They told her that they had had some report of people breaking out with hives, and told her to not to get hot, keep the house on a cool temperature. He prescribed Prednisone and Pepcid and to continue with the Benadryl and suggested to not to take the 2nd shot. She called the help desk to see if it was okay to take the Prednisone and answered her questions and told her there was no indication that she could not take it. The symptoms still come and go with the hives and itching.

(Had  arm pain and mild chills and fatigue).  The day after dose two above noted fullness and discomfort in feet, On the second day after, had  early erythematous (non-puritic) rash, mild multi-joint discomfort, 100 deg fever, and shaking chills. Doctor on call said to use judgment on starting Prednisone, since hope that this would stabilize.  However, progressed and at 9am on the third day after vaccine started prednisone 40mg.  At the worst, had to be dressed by husband due to pain and stiffness in upper extremities, widespread erythematous rash, fullness of skin, joint swelling.

Deep and extreme.Chills Steady, Night Hard vomiting, Hives, Soaking Night sweats (never had before), Temp 101.5.    Day 5 Morning - rapid test negative, fever 99.9.  Started Ibuprofen Day 6 - Hives same - extremely dark and red. itchy. # day swab test was POSITIVE. Put on Prednisone. Day 7 - Fever normal, Hives going down but still ugly.  Not sure whether this was really an adverse event as it was a positive test result AFTER the vaccine.  I am an allergig person whose eosinophils report for duty quickly and obviously too much!   I will assume that they were the result of the virus and NOT the drug as the drug does not have an active virus included.  Your call.

                                                About 38 hours after receiving the vaccine (2-20-21 - 1:00 am) I realized there was a blister located on my shoulder about 1.5? to the right of the shot area (which was bruised). I don&#39;t know exactly when the blister started.  I put 2-18-21 on this form since I didn&#39;t know. The size of the blister was approx. 1/4 x 3/8.  I realized I had taken my blood pressure using the shot arm (3 times about 3 hours after receiving the shot and again the next day) and worried the tightness of the BP cuff had affected the shot and pushed the vaccine to cause the blister.  I spoke to a couple of medical people at medical center and they didn&#39;t think so and said it was probably ok and to report it.  The blister has gone away but the skin is a reddish pink.

                                                Insomnia, sleeplessness and brain fog starting one week after vaccine and lasting for one week.  Sleeplessness was worse each night, with inablilty to sleep even with 50 mg of Benadryl and Valium.  Did sleep about  two hours a night with those meds but continued to be wide awake all day also.  My body felt like it hadn&#39;t slept but was unable to do so.  These symptoms left me suddenly with a severe chill and the brain fog litarally lifted and was gone.  The next week following developed mild red itchy skin that comes and goes on hands and torso and that symptom persists.  I am now able to sleep.

A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EN6201, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Feb2021 at 04:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medications included tolterodine and adalimumab (HUMIRA). The patient reported that she received the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 at around 4:30. Firstly it was fine, she felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore. What concerned her was the swelling started almost immediately after the shot on 18Feb2021. She knew that was one of the symptoms. This morning and yesterday though (18Feb2021), she noticed some of the symptoms. She got a large knot that was right above the injection site. Yesterday, it was about the size of a half dollar, today it is about the size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot. It feels like an egg under the skin or a clot. Like a knot (a hard spot underneath the skin). The patient was wondering if it was something she should be concerned about because the swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area. It was a rectangle and is about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high and then right above that was where the needle went in. The large circle or knot was right above that and she was thinking possibly when she was given the injection she has never really bleed before. So, she thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm. She got no problem. That happens at times, but she started thinking if this was a clot or it was something that is right above there because it is so pronounced, and it really hurts. The patient stated that she took some Aspirin last night and is going to take an ibuprofen in a little while. She mentioned that she takes this one pill and it has nothing to do with anything.  The patient had lab work done (unknown results) that was about 3 weeks ago (2021). She also stated that she also take Humira which is a shot every 2 weeks and it said in the fact sheet that she should be concerned or be sure that she did not take any medicine that affects the immune system and Humira does weaken the immune system but she was not ask that prior to. The patient wanted to know if is that something she should be concerned about. Outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                The evening after patient received vaccine, she started to develop low grade fever and urticarial rash at the vaccine site. The urticaria improved the following day, as did the fevers. Then 3/5, the fevers started again, several times per day, as high as 102 at home.  In association with the fever she has had some mild nausea, x1 non-bloody emesis last night, as well as rigors/night sweats.  She went to urgent care and eventually was admitted to the hospital for the following 9 days. During this admission, she continued to have fevers intermittently as high as ~103. She also developed more generalized urticarial rash (worst on trunk), and lab abnormalities including low platelets and elevated liver function tests. She had extensive testing, ultimately determined likely vaccine reaction, started on prednisone 40 daily and improved for discharge to home on 3/17 without fevers x48 hours and with improving labs.

I was given a shot and antibiotics and told to return if not better.  So on Monday, March 8, I returned to ER and then was admitted to the hospital.  I was allowed to go home on Saturday, March 13.  Since then I had two sores to develop on my left leg.  I had to have wound surgery on them on March 25.  I am a lot better but still not completely well.

A 66-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3302, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy from 2006 and ongoing, since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer in 2006 and burning mouth syndrome. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had other medications in two weeks which included unspecified dietary supplements. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took doxycycline from 2010 to an unknown date for Lyme&#39;s diseaseand experienced burning mouth syndrome. On 11Mar2021 at 02:00 PM, patient had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. These symptoms still continue. Patient stated that people were talking about the second dose being worse. Patient stated that some of the reactions in Mar2021 look like an allergic reaction. They (HCP) only have cautioned the patient about difficulty breathing in Mar2021. They were saying there wasn&#39;t anything they can do for it. Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment. If they are going to continue, patient was very concerned about following up with the second shot and asked if they can have that second shot be postponed until patient was not experiencing these side effects to the effect that she was. She completed the self-reporting on Monday (15Mar2021), but because her side effects were not going away she wanted to reach out to someone. She has reached out to her practitioner and had an appointment yesterday. Doctors didn&#39;t really know because it was all very new. She had the first vaccination shot on 11Mar2021, almost a week ago. In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme&#39;s disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn&#39;t know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn&#39;t want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well. No practitioner can recommend whether to do it or not to do it. She reported this information online to Pfizer on 15Mar2021. She provided the lot number when she reported it online. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. No treatments received from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The patient recovered with lasting effects from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The outcome of the other reported events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Mar2021 10:30 (at the age of 66-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The vaccination facility type was a health clinic. The vaccine was not administered at a facility. The patient had no additional administered vaccines. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Medical history included ongoing seizures from 1982 (began shortly after she had the surgery for her brain aneurysm (in 1982 to 1982). The patient had not had any seizure activity for 20 years before the seizures that occurred on 13Mar2021. Sometimes electrical activity in the brain hits the metal clamp used to treat the brain aneurysm and that triggers the seizures); migraines (suffered from migraines when she was younger but hasn&#39;t had one in umpteen years. The patient gets tension headaches like most people but not very often); shingles (patient had shingles three times. Patient&#39;s first case of shingles was in the early 1990&#39;s and that patient had recurrences in the mid 1990&#39;s and the early 2000&#39;s. The first incidence was the worst and that the second and third occurrences weren&#39;t nearly as bad as the first); blood pressure high; ongoing cholesterol; ongoing headache (tension headaches) and was adopted. Family history included migraines with grandkids, a couple of them had migraines and had MRI&#39;s she&#39;d had a sister that was 6 years older than her that had died of a brain aneurysm. Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA) for seizures from an unspecified date (in the late 90&#39;s) to an unspecified date then from Mar2021 and ongoing; nadolol for headache from 2001 and ongoing; lovastatin for cholesterol from an unspecified date (been on it for a long time) and ongoing and on a low dose of medication for high blood. The patient had the Pfizer vaccine first shot on Friday (12Mar2021). The husband stated his wife (patient) had a possible side effect to the vaccine shot and was concerned with getting the second dose of Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine. She had 2 seizures the next morning after the shot (on 13Mar2021) which she hasn&#39;t had in 20 years. The patient experienced her first seizure about 11:00 on 13Mar2021. It took the patient about 45 minutes to come out of the first one completely, until she was conscious again. The second seizure occurred about 13:00 on 13Mar2021, about an hour and a half after the patient recovered from the first seizure. fter the second seizure, the fire department was called and she was transported to the Emergency Room. The doctor told the husband that it was up to them if they wanted to receive the second dose. The husband stated, &#34;I know there is something out there that I heard about where you can disqualify yourself from getting the vaccine for medical reasons.&#34; Also on 13Mar2021, the patient&#39;s tongue hurts in the Emergency Room, no one was willing to give her a new tongue after she bit it. The patient&#39;s tongue was what hurt&#39;s the most, but that it was slowly healing. The patient seemed to be fine since Saturday. he patient&#39;s father was really persistent about them getting the Covid-19 vaccinations. A CT scan and blood work were performed while she was in the Emergency Room on 13Mar2021 and reported that everything was fine. The patient went to the emergency room on 13Mar2021 and physician office on 17Mar2021 as a result of the seizure activity on 13Mar2021. On 17Mar2021, the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 130/82 with blood work with result of everything was fine. The patient went to her physician on 17Mar2021 due to concern about getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. When asked about prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient stated that she didn&#39;t want to get the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine because she&#39;s never even had the flu shot. The patient stated that back in 1977 when they first came out with the flu shot, she was unable to receive the vaccine as she was pregnant and she has never gotten the flu. The patient reported that she was unable to get MRIs due to the metal clamp in her. Patient reported that the clamp in her head was metal, not surgical metal, and that she has to be very careful because getting an MRI could kill her. The patient reported that next the day (in Mar2021) her arm was so hot that she could have roasted a weenie over her arm and it was very swollen. The patient reported that she went to urgent care and was told that it was an allergic reaction. The patient also reported that she got shingles again after receiving the vaccination. The husband considered the case as non-serious. The patient recovered from seizure with associated disease recurrence on 13Mar2021; for tongue pain was recovering while for the remaining events was unknown.

                                                seizures; muscle fatigue; hives; rash from head to toe; sore muscles; wrap around headache; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable healthcare professional (patient herself). A 66 -year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. She provided a brief history from 2017. She was walking her dog and she fell and suffered a concussion, she had a seizure, then she developed bipolar disorder. She&#39;s been taking sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) for her seizures since 2017. She reports she&#39;s very active. She&#39;s not an old lady. She can run circles around some 22 year old&#39;s. In September of 2017, she had a concussion and had seizures. She&#39;s been on sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) since that time. She&#39;s not mentally ill, the concussion she got in 2017 caused her brain to turn bipolar. It&#39;s hard for people to understand that. Sodium valproate (DEPAKOTE) was 500mg. She takes 1 tablet in the morning and 2 tablets at night because it can make you sleepy. She reports she was recently hospitalized in Feb2021 for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR). Her heartrate was 181 beats per minute, her blood pressure was dropping, she tested positive for rhinovirus and the doctor thinks the atrial fibrillation with RVR was caused from the rhinovirus. She was allergic to bee venom and carries an EPI PEN. Medical history also included ongoing high blood pressure from an unspecified date (controlled with medication). Concomitant medications included ongoing metoprolol tartrate (LOPRESSOR) taken for blood pressure; ongoing lisinopril; ongoing valproate semisodium (DEPAKOTE) taken for seizure from 2017; ongoing hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril (LISINOPRIL HCTZ) taken for blood pressure; paracetamol (TYLENOL) from an unspecified date in 2021. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9810; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021). The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions or any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported; or any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The patient reported that with the second Covid 19 vaccine she had two seizures on 27Mar2021. The seizures were back to back. The seizures resolved within 2 minutes. She had fatigue from an unspecified date, sore muscles and a wrap around headache on 26Mar2021. The wrap around headache felt like she was going to have a stroke even though her blood pressure was fine. She monitored her blood pressure at her home. She feels it&#39;s weird that they publish that the second Covid 19 vaccine is going to be worse. She thought she&#39;d have muscle soreness and fatigue but not seizures. She looked it up and the wrap around headache and seizure are the rarest things that can happen after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She stayed in bed from Friday afternoon after she received the second Covid 19 vaccine on 26Mar2021 and started to feel better Sunday afternoon, 28Mar2021. Her blood pressure and pulse were both fine with her wrap around headache. She had fatigue with both Covid 19 vaccines. She also developed hives, which she still has. She has a rash from her head to her toes. It looked like she rolled around in an ant bed. The hives were clearing up. She was using an anti-itch cream. The hives and the rash started midday on Saturday, 27Mar2021. She only has around 5 hives now on her chest. She hasn&#39;t taken Benadryl. She doesn&#39;t like to take it. Her doctor didn&#39;t want her to open the hives and cause impetigo. She never had any soreness in her arm. She doesn&#39;t think the headache was serious because she had a blood pressure cuff at home. She just knew the hives and the rash were a reaction to the Covid 19 vaccine. She didn&#39;t go to the hospital for her seizures. She was not seen in the Emergency Department, hospitalized, or admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. She tries to do holistic medicines and treatments. She doesn&#39;t run to the hospital every time something happens. She tries to stay out of the hospital. She&#39;s fine now and she loves Pfizer. If she can get a medicine she needs that Pfizer makes she tries to get it. She tries to see every side of things. Outcome of seizures was recovered on 27Mar2021 and sore muscles was recovered on 28Mar2021; of remaining events was recovering.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and seizure cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

A 66-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6208) via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm 10Mar2021 at 12:30 (66-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included thyroid, and &#34;had stem cells put in her hip&#34;. Concomitant medications included ongoing thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID) for thyroid. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm 17Feb2021 at 14:00 (65-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received the second dose of VARICELLA ZOSTER VACCINE RGE (CHO) (SHINGRIX) for shingles and felt like we were getting the flu and the next morning was fine. Patient states she had stem cells put in her hip and was (medical office name) for an x-ray to see how it&#39;s doing. She showed a nurse practitioner her hand and nurse practitioner said patient needs to report that. Patient states it swells right under her finger, swelling under her middle and ring finger. The joint went stiff and the pain. She can&#39;t bend her fingers, it is mostly her ring finger. She couldn&#39;t straighten it out or bend it all the way down, it was like it was locked. Following her second vaccine dose she has had pain in the center of the palms of her hands and bottom of her feet. The pain is inconsistent as it comes and goes. The feet pain come and go not bad like the hands. The middle of the palm pain comes and goes and the joint on 1 finger never did get better, it is worse at night and a teeny bit better in the morning. She felt pain in 1 of her feet for a moment yesterday and not continuous like her hand. The left hand is not swelling, the center of her palm has a weird feeling, states she has never had shingles before but imagines that is what the palm of her hand would feel like, it is an achy pain. States she kept telling her husband she has pain in the center of her hands and on the bottoms of her feet and feels like she is about to have a break out and didn&#39;t. Patient states it has been a month since she had the 2nd vaccine. States the symptoms all started within 24 hours of the 2nd vaccine. On 07Apr2021, nurse practitioner put a lubricant injection (name unknown) into her hand where the swelling was. Patient was told it was a lubricant that might help, and it has helped some. It is moving a little better today after the injection but she still has pain. Adverse events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;swells right under her finger&#34; and included lubricant injection. The outcome of swells right under her finger, joint stiffness, and joint lock was recovering; other events were not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 17Mar2021 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 66 years old) (Lot Number: EN6205, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing anxiety (40 years or more), ongoing depression (46 years ago, at the age of 20), ongoing acid reflux (maybe 25 years), ongoing GERD (maybe 25 years), ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus (for 12 years), mild to moderate COPD since 2011, gastric bypass (a year and a half ago), and lost 120 pounds. Concomitant medications included bupropion for anxiety depression and omeprazole for acid reflux, both ongoing.  The patient previously received flu and tetanus on unspecified dates for immunization and both experienced hard red welt on arm (welt was hard and lasted for 5-7 days). The patient reported no side effects for 12 hours, but a little soreness at injection site on 17Mar2021 at 20:00 (8:00 PM). Her arm wasn&#39;t heavy, but she had an awareness of the soreness.  She has had life-long anxiety and depression. Several weeks ago (on 26Mar2021), her anxiety reared up, and it could have been due to a family situation. On the 9th day after the first shot, she was having a therapy appointment on the phone and talking about her anxiety, and she got a stiff neck, like an iron claw (26Mar2021 at 10:00 am). It lasted for a couple of 5 minutes and she laid down on the couch then on the floor.  Her therapist said to call 911. Emergency medical technicians came to her house and they said all of her numbers looked good.  She went to the hospital, and was in the emergency room for several hours, but she only remembers one hour of it.  She also had diarrhea and nausea on 26Mar2021 at 11:30, and it felt like Dumping Syndrome, that one can have from a gastric bypass. She was only aware for one hour at that point and blacked out (on 26Mar2021). With regards to nausea, she mostly saw bile in the bag, all she had that day was a protein drink. She was back home and the next day, she did not remember how she got home. She hasn&#39;t had blackouts anymore but feels it may be from heightened anxiety.  On 27Mar2021 at 09:00, she had no appetite, lost 6 pounds in a week, and was tired. She had headache lasted for days and days on 29Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. She is slowly improving but she still doesn&#39;t sleep through the night on 29Mar2021 at 16:00. It was like a feeling like she was resetting her surgery, like she didn&#39;t care about eating.  The also experienced back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica on 31Mar2021 at 16:00 and was constipated. She is using a stool softener and is back in her routine. She called her primary doctor and could not tell her what happened, and she went in a loop trying to get information and authorizations for her to make a determination of what had happened.  Her doctor felt like she should have an MRI. Her heart and all of her numbers looked good, as the emergency medical technicians said. Her primary doctor recommended her to get the second shot.  She had cancelled the second shot for this week, and she has rescheduled it for another date.  She was afraid that she will black out again, after the next vaccine, and is not sure if that is how her anxiety manifested. The main reasons she is calling is that she had no concerns of side effects prior to the vaccine, and a couple of her neighbors said they had read about side effects of the vaccine, but she was not worried.  When the patient started to read about side effects of the vaccine, she understood that on the 10th day, the vaccine starts to be in a person&#39;s system and that maybe is why she didn&#39;t have initial side effects, but then she had side effects several days later because the vaccine was in her body.  By day 10, the vaccine is in effect in the body and she is nervous. Her second vaccine is scheduled on 26Apr2021. The patient would like to know if there is any information on people that have had a gastric bypass. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The events resulted in emergency room visit (except nervous). The patient recovered from soreness at injection site on 18Mar2021; recovered from diarrhea, nausea,  felt like Dumping Syndrome on 26Mar2021; recovered from stiff neck on 26Mar2021 at 10:05am; recovered from constipation on 02Apr2021; and recovered from no appetite and lost 6 pounds on unspecified dates. The patient also recovered from headache with sequelae on unspecified date; and recovered from blacked out on 27Mar2021 with sequelae. The patient had not yet recovered from anxiety reared up; tired; doesn&#39;t sleep through the night; back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Almost immediately after taking the vaccine for covid19, I felt extreme dizziness (vertigo).  The nurse had me drink some water and eat some nuts. I had drunk some glucerna that morning for breakfast with my medication.  The RN had me wait for about an hour. I then called my primary care doctor who told me to go home and rest. He said that I did not need to go see him or go to a clinic or Emergency Room unless I felt worse. (I have progressively felt better).  I left his number and contact information  under the contact information above. However, I had received the shot from the Hospital site.  I am providing this as you were a little vague in your question about contact address. Anyway, my husband took my temperature about 6 pm. I had a temperature of about 93.8. I normally have a temperature of 98.6 F. He used a digital thermometer. However, I did not feel as if I had asthma. I did have a slight headache then and my arm was a little bit sore. Today (the 29th) my temperature is about normal. I do not have any breathing problems, but my arm is a little bit sore where I got the shot. I still have a slight headache, but it&#39;s not too bad. I don&#39;t need to take medication for it. There is no redness at the site of the injection. I should mention that one of the RN&#39;s did look at my fingernails and the color was normal which I assume means no problems with oxygen levels. I am only reporting this because of the extreme dizziness! I felt a lot better after about an hour after taking the shot, drinking the bottle of unflavored (still) water and eating the nuts. My A1C is back to normal today. (and remember I am not currently needing or taking any form of insulin but my doctor has my blood checked regularly and has for many years). I am only putting no on the item number 20 below because I still have a slight headache and a little bit of soreness in the injection site. Today the site of the injection  is not red either.

                                                No problem with injection site.  Developed what appears to be a rash (hives?) on my right side at my waistline.  Noticed two spots and at first thought it was bug bites.  Since Wednesday, several more spots have appeared in same area around waist from navel area around to back.  Spots are not large or itchy but have an occasional mild sensation like a twinge (mostly from the new spots).  Been self-treating  with witch hazel, hydrocortisone cream, fexofenadine and acetaminophen.   Note:  I am assuming this is a side effect from Covid vaccine because I have never before had hives.   I had a senior flu shot in October with no side effects.

                                                3 days following vaccine, experienced tenderness and discoloration in left hand. With it was tenderness in my hand and wrist, by the 3rd day, I woke with throbbing pain in my knuckle joint with swelling and redness. Since then, the swelling and pain has progressed to additional knuckles in my left hand and into my right hand. There has also been joint pain in my left shoulder that resolved. Yesterday my right knee began to hurt. I&#39;ve used ice packs and alternated between  ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the pain. The swelling has somewhat improved but has not resolved. The pain is still present. I&#39;ve had occasional join pain before but nothing like this and it has always  resolved. Not sure if this has anything  to do with the vaccine, but since joint pain was listed as a side effect, I thought I should report it. Have not contacted my physician yet.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899, reported as &#34;SARS-COV-2 then it says Pfizer EH9899&#34;, expiry date: Unknown), subcutaneous on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization (reported as &#34;To not get COVID 19&#34;). Medical history included hypothyroidism. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 25mcg, once a day for hypothyroidism. The patient got the vaccine last Tuesday (05Jan2021). When she got the vaccine, the gentleman was from military who gave the vaccine. The patient does not believe that he gave it intramuscular (IM), she believed that he gave it &#34;subQ&#34; because she had no muscle tenderness and &#34;skin a 4.5 by 7cm skin reaction&#34;, and it was nowhere near the deltoid muscle. The patient had a high degree of suspicion that he gave it &#34;subQ&#34; (subcutaneous). When asked for the anatomical location of administration, the patient stated that &#34;He gave it on my right arm but it was not into the deltoid, I think he gave it subcutaneously. I am not positive of that but missed the deltoid, it was lower, it was below the deltoid, it was in between the deltoid and the bicep and I am assuming it was subQ because none of my muscles were sore at all after getting the vaccine, accept that big red spot on my arm&#34;. Patient asked &#34;Now my question to you is because I looked through all your literature and I can&#39;t find anything about this&#34;. Since then the skin lesion within a couple of days it was up to about 4.5 to 7cms. It was still about that size however the redness has gone way down, &#34;the not redness&#34;, just pink, the swelling was almost gone. The heat coming out of it was almost gone. The patient mentioned that the actual skin region was much better, it was still about the same size though. Patient was not too worried about that and stated &#34;what am concerned about is what I&#39;ve also have is a low grade temperature elevation and some fatigue. If I got it on 3 O&#39;clock on Tuesday the 5th that would be day 9. Is the 9 days post injection for dose 1 to still have a low grade temperature elevation and some fatigue. Is that acceptable or does that indicate a problem?&#34;. Patient stated the she went to her internist and he had a look at it and he said &#34;I had no idea, he said that they just don&#39;t have experience like this. Do you have a phone number that I can talk to somebody?&#34;. The patient was about 5&#39; 7&#34; (height) and about 175 pounds (weight) approximately. The patient stated that fatigue and temperature elevation started one or two days after the vaccine (Jan2021). Patient reported that she still have it. The fatigue was much less but it was there and low grade temperature elevation was still there. There was no investigation assessment. The patient assessed that the events swelling, redness, skin lesions, temperature and fatigue were related to COVID-19 vaccine, also reported as &#34;Yes, because I never had that before and I am not taking anything now. So, it is like yes. It is definitely because that. The two main symptoms I am asking about are the fatigue and the low grade temperature elevation&#34;. Outcome of the events fatigue and skin lesion, redness, swelling and heat coming out was recovering, for low grade temperature elevation was not recovered.

                                                About one week post-vaccination, I noticed itching and when I scratched, I noted a lump where it itched. This was Feb. 11th at about 2pm. When I got home, I removed my shirt and noticed I had a red blotch and lump at the vaccination site.  It no longer itches, but I still have the red splotches and a slight lump under the skin.  I want to know if it is safe to get the second vaccine. I already plan to get it in the opposite arm.

But at 4:30 am  2/22/2021 I was awakened by intense  itching on my left arm and hand.  Over the next 2 hours the itching increased in intensity and progressed to my right arm and hand, over my upper back and shoulders, and along the back of my thighs and buttocks.        I took 2 Benadryl allergy tablets (25mg) and used Benadryl GEL extra strength on the affected areas.  This resulted in my sleepiness for the remainder of the day. Contacted my physicians office for an appointment to resolve the issue.

Low grade fever, pain behind collarbone on both sides. By 7pm, severe chills.  2/12: Called PCP and advised of symptoms. Went and got a Covid19 PCR test just in case. Negative 2/13-2/15: Still had low-grade fever (usually around 100*) which often didn&#39;t present until 2pm and then stayed until bedtime. Glands became swollen, bad night sweats. Pain behind collarbone worse when sneezing, coughing, yawning, burping, etc. Additional information for Item 18: Almost like a &#34;catch&#34; rather than constant pain. 2/16: Went to local medical center for drive-thru rapid Covid 19 and flu test. Both came back negative as did the PCR Covid test they also ran.  2/17-2/20: Symptoms pretty much the same....no fever in the am and thought I was finally getting better, then it would spike again around 1:00-2:00. Never over 101*. On the morning of 2/21, the &#34;catch&#34; around the collarbone had moved down to the bottom of my ribcage.  2/22: Contacted PCP again and made appointment for bloodwork, chest x-ray, and further tests. &#34;Sick and tired of feeling sick and tired!&#34;

She said she knew that from the flu shot, but that never hurt her, this thing was sore (sore arm) on 26Jan2021. She said she wasn&#39;t worried about that though, she just wanted to know if the taste would go away, and if it was normal. She said that there was nothing that said anything about diarrhea either, and she was not sick, she didn&#39;t feel sick, there was just the taste. Outcome of the events was unknown.

I informed the technician that I had allergies and had previously had anaphylaxtic reactions to foods and some medications.  I had noticed that the Pharmacy was not requiring people to stay after receiving the vaccine, so I told the technician that I would stay until I was sure I did not have a reaction.  No one came to check on me, and in about 15 minutes, I noticed that my scalp was starting to itch and my face felt hot.  I decided to go home, which was only a 5 minute drive from the store.  I took off my mask in the car and discovered that my face was very red and starting to feel tight.  I got home and took 1 Benadryl pill. By the time I got home, around 1:25 my ears were itchy and my lips were starting to swell.  I waited an hour and started to feel better, the color in my face was returning to normal, and I had no swelling of my throat, which I have experienced with food allergies.  At hour 2 I took a second Benadryl and went to sleep for 2-3 hours.  When I woke up, I felt better, my lips were still slightly swollen, but my face, scalp and ears were back to normal.

                                                Immediately after medicine went in my arm I felt a warm flush from my neck all the way to my toes (the same as when I have had radioactive dye),    during my 15 minutes of observation my hands and feet were cold and sweaty and I felt a little shaky.  I waited 20 minutes and went to the restroom and had diarrhea (very rare for me).  I went to my car and looked in the mirror and my face was bright red and  the whites of my eyes were red and my eyes were glassy.  I went back in to the observation area and was given oral Benadryl. and monitored for 45 minutes.  Right after I took the Benadryl my throat felt itchy (not sore - itchy).  My blood pressure was 157/62 when I first sat down but came down to 130/ 60 by the time I was sent home.  My bp is normally about 106/60.   I was really tired at home for the rest of the day so went to be early.  The next day I felt fine and my arm was only slightly sore.  The doctor at the immunization clinic told me not to get the 2nd shot.  I called my GP,  and he too told me not to get the 2nd COVID shot and wait until more information has come out about adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I did not have any difficulty breathing.  I don &#39;t know if the redness on my face went down my neck to my chest.  I didn&#39;t look.  I did not have a fever.

                                                Yesterday I received my 2nd Pfizer vaccine at 9AM. My first dose was a non-event. About 50 minutes after the jab, I broke out in hives on my upper thigh and stomach. By 7 PM, I felt really sick, my arm felt as though the strongest person in the world punched me, and by 8, I was shivering and wrapped in a ton of  blankets, by 10, every muscle in my body ached beyond its capacity and my fever was 101.8.  It got to 102.1. My head was weighed down with an unrelenting headache. Finally, an hour ago, my fever broke. I have Systemic Lupus and CRPS and do not vaccinate because my body is always attacking itself. But this year I got my first ever flu vaccine. Same results. So sick.

ITCHING WAS EXTRMEMLY INTENSE.  SEEMED TO BE SAME SPOTS BUT THERE WAS NO RASH OR REDNESS AT ALL, JUST THE ITCHING.  I COULD NOT SIT STILL OR LAY DOWN.  HAD TO FRANTICALLY SCRATCH THE SPOTS.  MORE ON TORSO... BUT A FEW SPOTS ON UPPER THIGHS TOO.  I HAD TO TAKE BENEDRYL TO FINALLY GET RELIEF.   DID IT THE NEXT DAY TOO IN THE AFTERNOON  OF 3/3/2021 AND THEN ANOTHER BOUT OF IT IN THE EVENING ON 3/4/2021.  IT JUST COMES ON AND WILL NOT END.  NOT DOING ANYTHING UNUSUAL AND NOT HAVING ANY OTHER REACTIONS.

I was taking additional insulin to try and bring it down and I wasn?t eating.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

A 67 years old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199) on 10Mar2021 17:30 at age of 67 years old at single dose in right upper arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included: last year February, she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, she has had acid reflux in the past. digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable). There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events (AE) following prior vaccinations. Patient had first Pfizer covid vaccine on 10MAR2021, approximately 10 days to 14 days after the vaccine her face swelled up, numbness and red on left side, went to see my  doctor, he treated her with steroid and antibiotic for sinus infection, at the same time she had some shortness of breath and pounding in my chest, and had and still have ringing in ears since then, it kind of flared up some digestive issues she had last year. If she back up to last year February, she had a bad sinus infection, went to see allergist, family doctor and ENT, all treated her for sinus&#39; before covid testing was even a thing, they didn&#39;t think of covid testing at the time. It ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity.  In March2020 her husband came home with covid, after that, talking to his doctor, she brought him meals outside of the door, it occurred to her that queried if this could have been covid. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable), they were still not sure if it could have been covid. She was supposed to get the second vaccine, she postponed it, the numbness and swelling of face is gone, next shot was tomorrow. Since this was a delayed reaction, typically one to three days would be a reaction to the vaccine. she didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine, asked if it could have been from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure that she was safe to get the second one. Response: Spoke from EUA factsheet for Recipients and Caregivers: LAB-1451-4.0 Revised: 06 April 2021: Sections: who should not get the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and what the risks of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE were. Spoke from attached VR Consumer- Pfizer cannot assess causality (i.e., cannot assess if what you described/are experiencing is associated with the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine). Your doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise you as your doctor/healthcare provider is most familiar with your medical condition, clinical history, how your treatment has been conducted and any relevant information to your specific case. Patient calling about the COVID vaccine. She states that she had the first vaccine 10MAR2021, and 10 days afterwards her face swelled up. She had numbness in it and redness. She went to the doctor and the doctor thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. So she was treated for that. She states that she did have a few other symptoms. To make a long story short, she was suppose to have the last vaccine last Friday. She postponed it for a week (postponed getting the second shot for a week). She wants to know what Pfizer thinks about her getting her second vaccine and her side effects. She says that somewhere between the 10th and 14th day, after receiving the vaccine the symptoms started and that was why she did not think she had a reaction to the vaccine. She has not had anything like that before, it was sort of a delayed reaction. She states she is better now. She had a few symptoms after the face things started and the only thing that she still has now is ringing in her ears. She states it all started around the same time as her face issues, or might have started a little after that. She confirms everything but ringing in her ears have completely resolved. She states that she did have some digestive disturbances, shortness of breath, and throbbing in her chest after receiving the vaccine. She asks if she can go back a little bit to explain. She states that last FEB2020 she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. She went to her allergist, then her family doctor, and then an ENT. She states that it was nothing like she has ever had, it was really bad. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, she has had acid reflux in the past but it was nothing like this. In March her husband had COVID and tested positive for COVID. She decided to get tested and she tested negative. She wonders if she had COVID earlier but at that time they were not testing for COVID. Her digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, and she was still on the medications her gastrointestinal doctor put her on. They are hypersensitive esophageal medication. She states that she has been exhausted all the time. The rest of the story she has told already. She states that after the face thing happened she started getting those digestive issues again. Her friend suggested that she call Pfizer, so she is doing that. She confirms that the vaccine card does not have an expiration date, NDC, or dosing information. She states it says 0.3 ml, but she cant see a point, so she doesn&#39;t know if its just 03. She states she got the vaccine to lessen her chances of getting a severe disease, in case she ends up in the hospital. Also, to keep herself safe from other people. She states she wants the second one because husbands works with the public and she wants to be protected when he comes home. She states that she has those gastrointestinal disturbances and is on amitriptyline 10 mgs for that. She states she also takes something for her thyroid but she has no major health issues. She states that she had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy as well as blood work done but she doesn&#39;t have any of the results because they are in her Beaumont chart where she actually got the vaccine. All of this was pre-vaccine so she doesn&#39;t know how relevant it is. The patient did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but visit to Physician Office. The only thing similar had a sister who reacted to a shingles vaccine, She has no information about her sisters reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of event ringing in ears was not recovered, for others was recovered.      No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 67-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6208) intramuscular, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 67-year-old, on 19Mar2021 11:00, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma and Allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number EN6203) single dose, at the age of 67-year-old, on 26Feb2021, for covid-19 immunisation and experienced slight ache in her left arm, headaches, and mitral valve disease.  On 20Mar2021, the patient had headaches off and on and the patient mostly woke up with them. The patient doesn&#39;t know if the headaches were from pollen in the air since it is Spring time or mold. On 24Mar2021 at 4am, the patient got out of bed because she had to use the restroom. As soon as the patient took the first step into the tile floor of the bathroom, the patient collapsed. The patient didn&#39;t fall, the patient collapsed on the file floor. Her head hit the floor. Her head was killing her when she was laying there. The patient used the restroom and went back to bed. The patient got out of bed because her head was killing her. The patient guesses she threw her right arm out to brace herself, because she noticed her right arm was bruised the morning of 24Mar2021 when she went to shower. The patient took Equate 500MG for the events head hit the tile floor of bathroom, headache, and right arm was bruised and used a wash cloth with cold water as a cold compress and applied it by her eyebrow, the corner of her eye was purple/bruised. It looked like she had eyeshadow on. On 24Mar2021, she was feeling nauseated. Thankfully, she had the next 2 days off  (Thursday and Friday) because she didn&#39;t feel so hot. On 26Mar2021, the patient called her PCP and was asked if she wanted to come in/ make an appointment. Since, the caller was planning to meet with the surgeon about her upcoming surgery on 29Mar2021, it didn&#39;t really fit into her schedule. She was undergoing all these tests, etc. It was determined her surgery was going to happen after receiving the second vaccine. The surgery is hopefully a mitral valve repair. The patient mentioned that her provider is aware of her experience with the COVID vaccine. The patient saw the surgeon on 29Mar2021, and she told him all about her experience. He advised the patient to call her PCP and schedule an appointment with them. She saw her PCP on 01Apr2021. She told her PCP what happened and her PCP asked why she didn&#39;t go to urgent care. The patient doesn&#39;t really know why she didn&#39;t, she just thought she was going to feel better. The patient thought she would work through the pain since Mar2021. Plus, she had everything going on with her surgery- like finding out she had to have the surgery and going under other tests. Her PCP wanted her to go to radiology to have a MRI of the head/brain done. She had the MRI done at 3:00PM on 06Apr2021 and the results were negative. Up until last weekend, she still felt &#34;headachy&#34;. The patient has headaches too because of stress knowing her surgery was scheduled in a matter of 2 weeks, so she didn&#39;t know if the headaches she was experiencing was because of the COVID vaccine, stress, allergies, etc. The patient was certain the headache she experienced the day after she collapsed, was due to the collapse. The patient clarified that she knew it was more of a &#34;collapse&#34; instead of a fall because all the furniture leading to the bathroom, like the loveseat, lamp, cedar chest, etc, were all intact with no marks. It was like all of a sudden she collapsed. Her bruising is all gone, but there might be a slight mark that is like yellow and green (because the bruising changes colors) on her arm. Her eye was okay. The patient will have her planned surgery on 15Apr2021. The events required physician office visit. The patient underwent unspecified lab test and procedures relevant to her upcoming surgery but no other testing in regards to her symptoms after the COVID vaccine. Outcome of headache was not recovered, the events corner of her eye was purple/bruised and right arm was bruised recovered in 2021, while it was unknown for the other events.

It was determined her surgery was going to happen after receiving the second vaccine. The surgery is hopefully a mitral valve repair.

                                                bit achy and she can definitely tell where the injection was administered; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumer. A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration, at the left shoulder on 29Dec2020 around 3:00-4:00pm at single dose for immunisation .  Medical history included ongoing Sjogren&#39;ssyndrome, Raynaud&#39;s disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, two other conditions which the patient cannot remember, was on blood thinner, immunocompromised or on medication that compromises your immune system-all of which apply to her.  Concomitant medication included hydroxychloroquine (PLAQUENIL), warfarin, aspirin all from about 15-20 years ago as a blood thinner. On 29Dec2020, patient felt like the vaccine has affected her a bit as she was feeling a bit achy and she can definitely tell where the injection was administered because sometime last night she rolled over and thought well she won&#39;t be sleeping on that left arm after getting the vaccine injection in her left shoulder. She was not sure if her feeling a bit achy is just the day, or related to the vaccine. Patient did not read the product paperwork until last night when she got home after having been administered the vaccine. She was given an approximate date of her second scheduled dose around 19Jan2021; that is not necessarily the date she will get the second dose; that depends on the next clinic date at the county health department. No plan to change dose unless advised to. The patient has not yet recovered from the events.

I applied Vaseline Intensive Care lotion like I usually to after shower and noticed my legs and feet were pretty red. I called my husband in to look at my back, nothing on back, chest or arms. Considered taking a Benadryl due to itch and redness but afraid it would make me sleepy at 4:00 pm. Then over a period of about 15 minutes total after stepping out of the shower, it was fading quickly along with the itching and completely gone within  20 minutes. The lotion helped the itching about 75% initially.

I took a 12-hour allegra about 12pm and a single 25 mg benadryl tablet at bedtime. The symptoms lasted about 3-4 hours before resolving.  They did not get worse from the immediate reaction. Recommended contacting my family physician for advice of what to do before 2nd shot which is scheduled for Feb. 15, 2021

This 68-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 12Jan2021 13:30 on Arm Left at single dose (lot: EK9231, Expiry: 30Apr2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Give her a follow up appointment for a second dose, that will be 02 Feb at 1:20 PM. Medical History included arthritis and had surgery for right knee replacement 6 years ago (2015). They are trying to figure out, she has water in her ear she has had CT scans recently trying to check for any problems that could be corrected surgically and that was all clean. She has had a mammogram, she was not sure about the mammogram yet but she thinks they would have called her if there was a problem with that. Historical vaccine included Just mild stuff with the flu vaccine for immunisation on occasion she has had similar reactions that were very mild with the flu vaccine and last year she had none of that at all. She says when she has had any other vaccine, she had no reaction other than maybe a slightly sore arm. No other products. She did have some mild side effects. She was really glad she got this shot. She said she had experienced some chilling on 13Jan2021, these are all very mild symptoms. She had a sore throat on 13Jan2021, some aching, like body aches on 13Jan2021 and joint tenderness on 13Jan2021. She just got chilled every once in a while. It was not very bad. She said the sore throat had persisted about the same, but the coffee helped. She was having some swelling at the injection site that was about the same as when it began on 13Jan2021. She was having some arm tenderness on 13Jan2021. She did not have any adverse reactions yesterday (12Jan2021) she was so excited to get it. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                Back pain; tired; whole body trembled; nervous; facial tingling; immediate pain in arm from injection; couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all; left eye twitching; Chills; Nausea; no appetite; whole body ache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for herself. A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Jan2021 5:15 PM at a single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing shellfish allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing iodine allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing Mitral valve prolapse (for 20 years), blood pressure high, and cholesterol. The patient had mitral valve prolapse for about 20 years now. They are just watching it now. She just saw the cardiologist, and had an echo done. If the symptoms worsen, they will proceed. Concomitant medications included diltiazem for blood pressure high and atorvastatin for cholesterol, both from an unspecified date and ongoing; she has been on these medications for 30 years now. On 11Jan2021, the patient experienced facial tingling, immediate pain in arm from injection, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all, left eye twitching, chills, nausea, no appetite, whole body ache, tired, whole body trembled, nervous. On 12Jan2021, the patient experienced back pain. The patient explained that on 11Jan2021, evening at 5:15pm, she received her first COVID 19 vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine was being given out at that time. She has shellfish and iodine allergies. So, they made her sit and wait 30 minutes after being injected. One of her daughters took her. On the drive home, a few minutes after leaving she developed facial tingling. At first, she thought nothing of it. She did have immediate pain in her arm from the injection. By the time she got home, she couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all. It was that painful. The next morning, she couldn&#39;t lift arm, and if she tried, she would be in pain. Also, her left eye started twitching right away also. That night she really noticed it. It was not a constant twitching. She thought at first it was because she was tired or from the pain in her body. But then she noticed the next day it was still doing that. It was still twitching. It is not constant, but it was here and there. She still had it on 13Jan2021, but so far nothing at the day of report (14Jan2021). She also had chills. She had on double clothes, and coverings on her feet and hands. The chills wouldn&#39;t go away. Her whole body trembled. On 13Jan2021, Wednesday morning, they went away. She experienced nausea and no appetite. Her whole body ached. It was so brutal. The problem was with her left eye. It didn&#39;t twitch constantly, but it got her nervous. She is pretty sure she is going to refuse the second dose. She has heard that the 2nd part is when most people have the worst side effects. So, she is not comfortable getting it. She also got back pain. It wasn&#39;t severe, but it was there. She is against getting the second shot. She stated that she is a medical assistant at a pediatric office. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got it (vaccine) because of her age. She was advised to get it as she was around patients. Work gave them the option. The inability to move her arm ended in the middle of night at 4 am 14Jan 2021. She noticed she could move her arm. Her second dose is scheduled for 01Feb2021 at 8:45 am. She does work in a pediatric office. If the second part of side effects are worse, then she doesn&#39;t want to take the chance. The eye has her concerned. Outcome of the events were as follows: facial tingling recovered on 11Jan2021, immediate pain in arm from injection recovered on 13Jan2021, chills recovered on 13Jan2021, nausea recovered on 13Jan2021, no appetite recovered on 13Jan2021, whole body ache recovered on 13Jan2021, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all recovered on 14Jan2021, back pain was recovering, while outcome for events left eye twitching, tired, whole body trembled, and nervous, was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

After 3-4 days, my hairline started receding slightly on the sides of my scalp in the front.  This continued each day and I had to increase my blood pressure medicine and double the dose because it was getting so high.  I was anxious and upset and am afraid to take the second dose because I feel that I will get a worse reaction, and am frightened.

Around 6:00 PM on 22Jan2021, the patient can feel her ear &#34;closing up&#34; and by Saturday-Sunday had lost hearing on the right ear - the same side of her arm she received the vaccine. The patient stated it was better on 25Jan2021 but still not 100 percent. The patient tried calling the emergency room and has read up and no one can give her any answers. She made an appointment this morning with her doctor to see what was going on, states not being able to hear messes with her equilibrium. The patient was supposed to have another dose on 12Feb2021 and wanted to know if she should. The patient currently still had partial hearing loss and was prescribed a Prednisone that she took for 5 days. Her arm did not hurt Friday through Sunday, however, on Monday, her arm was red, swollen, and growing. She was able to get partial hearing back after taking Prednisone. She had numbness in parts of the ear and was now able to feel parts of the ear, but she was not sure if the numbness will go away. The outcome of hearing loss was resolving, of other events was unknown.

Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.

My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Approximately 2 days after the second injection, a large red flat rash (about 3&#34; x 3&#34;) began to form on my R arm, around and beneath the injection site.  Shortly after that, an extremely intense itching set in and lasted for 48 hours or so.  The itching was extreme, and not helped by either Benadryl or topical hydrocortosone cream.  The itching was  worse than that produced by exposure to poison ivy.     I experienced a similar reaction to the second Shingrix (shingles) injection, although the red rash that occurred after this injection was a bit raised and welt-like, in places.  Itching was also extreme, and very difficult to tolerate.  It, too, lasted about 48-72 hours.    Interestingly, I did NOT have this type of reaction to my annual flu shot this year, nor have I ever had such a reaction before.    I&#39;d like to know what inactive ingredients are common to both the Shingrix and Pfizer vaccines, as I suspect that something like that is the culprit.  Also seeking advice about what to do when boosters are recommended, if they are, for Covid-19.

Saw opthmologist prescribed Acyclovir.  Over a couple days swelling dissapeared and burning, itching subsided.  The thing is, I had my second COVID dose on 02/10/2021,  10:00AM Pitzer Lot #9581.  On 02/18/2021 late evening, started to feel burning in left eye nose area again, next morning eye swollen shut.  Saw Dr, said I was having an allergic reaction and put me on prednesone and Amoxicylin.  No reduction of swelling and burning, blisters were forming.  Went to Urgent Care on 2/20/2021 and was prescribed Acyclovir again.  Swelling now gone and itching burning diminished.

                                                I got the shot at 10:30am.  My arm was mildly painful at the injection sight.

These symptoms resolved during the day Friday, February 19th.

I also noticed small, red blotches.   *By Sunday, February 21, 2021, there were more blotches that had spread across to my back and across my chest on the left side. There was severe burning, zinging pain that traveled across my chest, under my left arm, and across to my back. * Monday, February 22, 2021, I visited the Doctor who confirmed it was shingles.  She prescribed 1 gram of Valacyclovir (Valtrex) 3x daily for 7 days. *The shingles have now covered my entire left breast,  under my entire left arm area with a huge patch on my back. It has become extremely uncomfortable with much burning, stinging, and zinging that travels along the rash area and down my left arm.

A 68-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm on 25Jan2021 at 11:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included Influenza vaccine in Dec2020 and Balance of Nature Fruits as supplement since Jan2021 - she started taking Whole Foods brand Balance of Nature Fruits pills and has been taking them off and on for the last couple weeks. On 27Jan2021, the patient had a lumpy, red area on the opposite shoulder from where she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she discovered the lumpy, red raised up bumps area on her left shoulder that morning. She said the lumpy, red area is on the back of her left shoulder, neck and hairline area. She said her husband said the lumpy, red area is a couple square inches in size. She said the lumpy, red area is not itchy, but it is tingling, and stings sometimes. She also asked if what she is experiencing is a side effect of the vaccine. The patient declined any treatment for the events saying she didn&#39;t know what to do. The event &#34;lumpy, red area on the opposite shoulder from where she received the COVID-19 Vaccine/lumpy, red raised up bumps area on her left shoulder&#34; had not resolved while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

Patient has a call with him tomorrow so he will know about this incase Pfizer calls. Patient stated that she knows with a normal vaccine she might have an ache or something but this one hurt bad, maybe they pushed it in too hard or something she does not know.

                                                I received the vaccine at 9AM on March 1st in my right arm.  Everything was fine until 3 PM when my right arm started swelling.  I ran a temperature of 100.1, had fatigue and a headache, in addition to aches and pains.  By Tuesday morning my right arm from the injection site to the elbow was twice it&#39;s normal size.  My chest and underarm area were both significantly swollen. I had an 8:30 AM appointment on Tuesday with an allergist who advised me to take Benadryl, which I did. By Wednesday, my chest and abdominal area were both swollen.  I had a lymphedema therapy appointment because I have lymphedema on my left side due to node removal. The therapist measured both arms and they were both swollen, including my chest and abdomen.  The therapist advised me to see my oncologist as swelling in the Right Arm, (where i received the shot) was normal for COVID shots, but she could not explain the swelling in the chest or abdomen.  Other than that my lymphatic system was working overtime. I called my oncologist on Thursday March 4, and they fit me in.  Doctor examined me and he couldn&#39;t explain to me why I was swelling up the way I was.  He has only seen arm swelling in his breast cancer patients. He is referring me to get a PET scan and advised me to see a breast surgeon as maybe the surgeon would know more about the lymph nodes.

A 68-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 10Feb2021 10:30 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety. It was reported that the patient was &#34;physically fit. She was thin and was about 5 feet.&#34; Ongoing concomitant medications included escitalopram (reported as &#34;generic Lexapro&#34;) for anxiety, calcium, and multivitamins. The patient previously received flu vaccine in Oct2020. She also had her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20Jan2021 10:30 AM for COVID-19 immunization and felt a little soreness in arm and light headache the same day. Two nights later, her scalp felt on fire and had tingling sensation in her face for three weeks. A week after the first dose, her blood pressure went up to 210/101. She went to the hospital, they controlled her pressure and put her on a pressure pill 1 a day (amlodipine). She mentioned she had felt a weird sensation and noticed some spikes in her blood pressure. Her physician told her to take another 2.5 mg amlodipine if needed. After her second dose, she went to sleep with achy arm. she woke up that night with a tingling sensation from head to toe. Her whole body was tingling. It was a weird and scary on and off sensation. She stated it had improved during the past two days. The patient confirmed that she had no heart rate problems. She actually experienced high blood pressure instead. She never had numbness, instead she had a tingling sensation still present. She mentioned her 97-year-old mother and husband both got the two doses with no complication or reactions. The patient&#39;s cousin was &#34;pretty sure that it&#39;s Guillain-Barre.&#34; The patient stated the Guillain-Barre syndrome has not yet been confirmed. She had an appointment with a neurologist. The outcome of &#39;tingling sensation from head to toe/whole body was tingling/weird and scary on and off sensation&#39; was recovering, of remaining events was unknown.

Patient had the 1st dose on 05Jan2021, and was due next Friday for her 2nd dose, but she has come down with shingles on her opposite arm on 11Jan2021. She doesn&#39;t know if it has anything to do with the vaccine. Has it been reported before, and can she get the 2nd dose. Shingles was reported as worsened. She has shingles on the left arm, hand, wrist, and fingers; she was in a lot of nerve pain in Jan2021. The pain started 6 days after she got the vaccine; pain and tingling. Then 2-3 days later, she noticed some red marks by her elbow. She went to a clinic and was diagnosed with Shingles and was started on Valacyclovir 1gm tablet, 1 tablet 3 times daily for 7 days. The next day she called the doctor, and had a tele-visit and the doctor was able to see some lesions. She told the doctor how much pain she was in, so the doctor prescribed Gabapentin 100mg. She was told to start off with 1 daily at night to help with sleep because she wasn&#39;t sleeping because the pain was so bad, then after 5 days she can take 1 twice daily as needed. States that it hasn&#39;t been 5 days yet, so she was still only taking it once at night, and she was able to sleep over 4 hours at a time, which was great. She wishes she could jump ahead and start taking it twice a day already because she was in pain all day long, but she was following the directions. States that the pharmacist said she could take Tylenol in between, so that was what she is doing. States that she was getting more lesions, but they are faint and are mostly on the palms of her hands and in between her fingers. The outcome of the event Shingles was recovered 11Jan2021; for Nerve pain was unknown.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right deltoid on 06Mar2021 10:09 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis; famotidine (PEPCID) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis; methylprednisolone acetate (MEDROL) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis. The patient previously received H1N1 vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, lot number: UP006AA, expiry date: 15Mar2011) on 27Oct2009 and experienced anaphylaxis. Patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the suspect product. The patient experienced blood pressure was checked and it had skyrocketed to 204/110 (hospitalization (from 06Mar2021 to 08Mar2021)) on 06Mar2021, felt chest pressure on 06Mar2021 10:29, facial flushing and warmth on 06Mar2021 10:29, redness on her neck and chest on 06Mar2021 10:29, she was lightheaded on 08Mar2021, blood pressure had dropped to 95/58 on 08Mar2021 21:43. Clinical course: Caller states that she received her first dose of the product on 06Mar at 10:09am. Caller states that to provide some history, in Oct2009, she had anaphylaxis from the H1N1 Vaccine and in 2017, she finally found an allergist who specialized in medication allergies. Caller states that since then, any time she takes the Flu Vaccine, she pre medicates with a combination of antihistamines and a proton pump inhibitor. Caller states that in preparation of the COVID vaccine, her allergist prescribed her a Medro Dose pack and antihistamines and a proton pump inhibitor for preparation, starting three days prior to the vaccine, in order to prevent anaphylaxis. Caller states that 20 minutes post receiving the vaccine, she started to feel chest pressure, she had facial flushing and warmth, and redness on her neck and chest. Caller states that her blood pressure was checked and it had skyrocketed to 204/110. Caller states that she did not have anaphylaxis though. Caller reports that with her blood pressure being so high, they had to call paramedics, and the caller went via ambulance to the ER at about 1130am on 06Mar2021. Caller states that she spent 6 hours in the ER, and then she was put in the hospital for the next two days. Caller reports she was admitted to the hospital for her blood pressure because the ER could not get it below 185 systolic. Caller states that all her labs were negative for everything, and they checked heart attack markers that were all negative. Caller had an EKG and a stress test and those were both negative as well. Caller had blood work done, EKG and stress test that were all normal. But caller states that it took a while to get her blood pressure down. Caller states that she was talking with her allergist and he said that if she gets the second dose of the vaccine, it would need to be in a hospital setting, with an IV already in place, and caller does not think insurance will cover all that. Caller states that she did speak with an Infectious Disease doctor, who told the caller that she needs to get the second dose of the product for COVID coverage, but how would the caller move forward with getting the second dose, following what happened to her? Caller is wondering how much protection the vaccine provides after just one dose? Caller is also wondering, the hospital gave her at least two or three doses of Solu-Medrol, and caller is wondering if having received steroids in the hospital would reduce the efficacy of the COVID vaccine, and if so, by how much? Event Details: Caller had the vaccine, and the reaction started on 06Mar2021, and she was admitted on the same day. Caller was discharged from the hospital on 08Mar2021 around 330pm. Caller reports that the morning of her discharge from the hospital, her blood pressure had gotten back to 135 systolic, but before it was time for her to go down for the stress test, it was back to 159, and down while she was in nuclear medicine, it got to 160 systolic. Caller reports that the day she was discharged, she went home and got settled in, and she took her blood pressure and it was down to 128/78, but then that evening, things got spinning around her, and lights were flickering in her head, and she was lightheaded, and her blood pressure was 110/63 at 9pm and by 9:43pm, her blood pressure had dropped to 95/58. Caller states that it has not been a fun trip. Caller reports that the next morning, her blood pressure was back up to 139/78, but then later in the day she was lightheaded again, and by 9am her blood pressure was 111/69. Caller states that since then, her systolic blood pressure has been between 110 and 126. Caller states that there is nothing else she can think of. Caller states that she felt fine the morning of getting the COVID vaccine, she was looking forward to getting it, and she got herself on the list and made sure to consult with her allergist so that she would have prophylactic medications ready to go. Caller states that she does have a history of hypertension, but her blood pressure was 128/72 the morning of getting the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events Blood pressure high and Blood pressure dropped was recovering, of the other events was unknown. The reporter considered the event blood pressure had skyrocketed to 204/110 was related to the suspect vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and known drug safety profile, a possible contributory role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the reported event blood pressure increased cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

On 12Jan2021 at 18:00, about 8 hours after vaccination (as reported) which was administered in a hospital, the patient experienced a full-blown narrow angle glaucoma. She was told that she had narrow angle glaucoma before. She saw a doctor prior to this though, back in Nov2020, for a routine visit and everything was normal. She had not had any attacks and was not on any medication for it previously. That night of the vaccine, she had rainbow colored halos around both eyes. She called her ophthalmologist and spoke to the doctor who was on call that night. He wanted to see her the next morning. Her pressures were a little high and they started her on drops. She then saw her regular ophthalmologist that afternoon. She had been seeing him every 4 months for the narrow angle glaucoma previously and had been fine since her last visit in Nov2020. It seemed like a coincidence. She reported since she knew it would take a while for all of the data to come back and she has not gotten the second one. The specialist said it could be triggered from the vaccine. Name of the drops she put on was Alphagan P. She no longer has it. She believed it was 1%, one drop in each eye, twice daily. She was taking a sample of that and currently, was taking generic Brimonidine 0.2% ophthalmic solution, 5mL, one drop in each eye twice daily. The patient was also on pilocarpine hcl. She went to an institute for a specialist. Nobody saw if there was anything in the literature. She reported to VAERS. She was calling to see if Pfizer has heard if there were any other cases.  Someone did call her back and she tried to search the data base. She was not very tech savvy. She has not had any problems. Nothing like that before hand. No problem since then. She has no known allergies. The only other thing was weird was that on 12Jan2021 at 16:00, 6-8 hours later (as reported), both her hands and wrist got red and itchy, to the point she went outside and stuck them in a snow bank. She did not have an anaphylactic reaction. She then said maybe some transient itching in other places and mentioned some bumps on the back of her right leg that were itchy. She did not know if it was worthy of reporting. She used to be 5 feet. She shrunk and it occurred before the vaccine. It was age related. The next dose, she may get the Johnson and Johnson, something that does not have the MRNA in it. She did not have to go to the hospital, but saw 3 different doctors for appointments for glaucoma. She needed significant intervention based on that. It was the beginning of using eye drops, which she never had. When she went to bed, she still had the halo&#39;s and when she woke up, they were gone. So, they went away on their own some time during the night. Her pressures were still elevated in her eye though compared to normal. When she went in at 08:00, the visual check was not as good as it normally was.  She did not know, but guesses she was 20/40 and normally was about 20/25.  It just wasn&#39;t as good as it was prior. Now it was back to 20/25. She mentioned that she takes some over the counter stuff and lisinopril for blood pressure. She took ALEVE afterwards but she takes Aleve every day. About 4 pm, she also took TYLENOL. She could not take antihistamines or decongestant because they could trigger. She was looking at the vaccine to see if there was an ingredient that could have caused it and she did not find anything.  She wanted to make sure the TYLENOL did not cause it. She was just looking at other variables. That was the one thing that was not normal to her. She was just trying to figure it out. She almost never takes TYLENOL and may have gotten rid of it.  She then clarified that it was generic,  ARTHRITIS PAIN RELIEVER ACETAMINOPHEN. She only took one. Once you think you are itchy, then everything is itchy. She used a mirror to see the back of her leg and was able to see her hands. She did not see any other bumps or redness though. She did not do anything about itchiness or redness. It got her attention, but she did not talk to any doctor about it. It went away.  When it happened, she was concerned.  She did not know how to characterize it. Somewhere between not serious and medically significant. She did not seek treatment for it. She was unable to confirm seriousness of bumps on her leg as well but mentioned that it went away. She was unable to determine if it was going to get worse. She could not take BENADRYL because of her eyes. She could not even treat it and take an antihistamine. The action taken in response to the events for paracetamol was unknown. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The events &#34;angle full-blown narrow angle glaucoma/ she had narrow angle glaucoma before/had not had any attacks and was not on any medication for it previously&#34;, &#34;Hands and wrist got red and itchy&#34;, and &#34;Hands and wrist got red and itchy/ Back of right leg was itchy&#34; were assessed as serious medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the events &#34;angle closure glaucoma aggravation, erythema, and pruritus&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 68-year-old non-pregnant Caucasian female Consumer received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL3247), via an Intramuscular injection in left arm on 25Jan2021 at 15:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patients medical history included allergic to penicillin. The patients concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not undergo any investigations. The patient had not received any additional vaccines on same day of the COVID vaccine. The patient had not received any vaccines with 4 weeks of vaccination. The patient received other unspecified medication with 2 weeks of COVID vaccination. Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed of COVID-19. Post vaccination the patient was not tested for COVID 19. On 02Feb2021 at 14:00, 8 days late, the patient noticed a little bit of itchiness. The patient did not think much of it and the patient did not think it was anything really noticeable, but her husband told her that she had some mild redness. On 03Feb2021, the patient noticed 3 quarters of an inch area that looks like a mosquito bite where it gets bigger and redder as one scratches. The patient not scratching the area, but it looks the patient had a mosquito bite and scratched it. She confirms this was located at the injection site of her left arm. The patient explained that this area at the injection has not got any worse. It was the same. It just started; she did not imagine it was going to get any worse. The patient did not require any emergency room or physician office. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. While she was sitting on hold waiting to speak to someone, she was reading online and found a doctor that had the same reaction as her except it was with Moderna&#39;s vaccine, and the patient also found others that had what they call an 8-day reaction. From reading these articles, it seems she has this reaction because its building up her immune system. The caller just wanted to make sure this is okay and that she can received the second vaccine. Caller states what she read was that it was okay to receive the second vaccine but just to receive the second one in her other arm. Outcome of events was not recovered.

Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

So then i left it alone because I didn&#39;t now if that was part of a reaction. When i got home i still had the odor in my mouth. i drank cold water and it went away. I waited. I felt sore on my arm but it wasn&#39;t that bad but as the hours went on it started getting more sore and painful. My arm was sore up to my shoulder and the back. After that the pain started traveling towards to my chest and i started getting pain in my chest. i took Tylenol (1 500 mg extra strength at 11:15 PM). So i waited 15 minutes to go to sleep. i got up the next day and everything was the same, i started putting ice on it and gave it time. I took another Tylenol but the pain was in my chest again a little bit. The third day the pain didn&#39;t come back in my chest and from then i was alright. I also started getting an itch.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL3248, expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at 12:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient has a medical history of having covid infection in Aug2020 where her symptoms were low grade fever and headaches only. The patient also stated that when she gets a virus, she always gets this kind of rash. The patient is in an ongoing year -long antibody study where they check for antibodies every 3 months. The results of the 1st titre was 270 after her 10-day quarantine period, and in Dec2020, it was still 270. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she had a sore arm on Friday, the day of the vaccination, 15Jan2021. She experienced pain in her right arm which got stronger at the injection site overnight. Then on Saturday 16Jan2021 at 11:00 AM all her symptoms started. She developed a low grade fever that never went over 101.4, a little headache, dizziness, and body aches. She stated that it was weird because she rarely gets sick, but she felt like she had the flu. She is getting a low grade fever between 99.6 and 100, flu-like symptoms and was dizzy. Then on the night of Saturday 16Jan2021, when she went to bed she had a red rash on her chest and upper abdomen; it was diffuse not pinpoint, wasn&#39;t raised. The rash was across her chest, breasts, and above her belly button, but not on her back. The patient reported that she still has the rash, and that it has actually gotten worse; it&#39;s spread more across her whole chest which is typical. Since when she gets a virus, she always gets this kind of rash; it doesn&#39;t itch; it&#39;s just kind of there and it&#39;s always in the same place whenever she gets it. The outcome of the event &#39;red rash on her chest and upper abdomen; it was diffuse not pinpoint, wasn&#39;t raised/rash was across her chest, breasts, and above her belly button, but not on her back&#39; was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in the left shoulder area on 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included COPD (has it for lots of years) and nickel sensitivity. She does not have any reactions to her previous unspecified vaccines but had a normal reaction like sore arm. Concomitant medication included bimatoprost (LUMIGAN).  The patient previously received flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, both for immunization in 2020 around the end of Sep or beginning of Oct. The patient reported side effects regarding the COVID vaccine and said she was a little confused and unsure if she was having a problem or if she should see a doctor. On 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM, she had the first dose of the COVID vaccine and afterward she had a lot of effects which were mostly muscle and body aches in Jan2021. She also experienced some ongoing congestion in one nostril but saw this as just more congestion and that she was having to blow her nose more in Jan2021. She did the (app name) report but didn&#39;t report the stuffiness. She did report that in the first few days she felt like she was having the onset of pneumonia and felt tired and run down (Jan2021). Two days ago, she started feeling itchy (Jan2021) and she didn&#39;t know what it was, she didn&#39;t know if she ate something or what. Now she has developed a rash (Jan2021) which is ongoing until now. Her paperwork said the rash would happen right away if it was caused by the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if this is something she should be concerned about and if the rash could appear or started this long after she had the vaccine. Her second dose is due on 06Feb2021. The patient wanted to know if the vaccine contains nickel or any metal substances in it since she had compared her rash to her nickel sensitivity. The patient wanted to know if rash is a side effect from the vaccine and how long it will last. She didn&#39;t put rash down for the safety check either as she didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine. Today her rash, she is so itchy. She does have it on her neck and certain areas but not everywhere. It looks like what would happen after a bad fever. It is not raised but is like a fever type rash.  She did note that she had an increase dose of a medication eye drops (Lumigan; Lot: T and a 0 or O followed by 544, and NDC: 0023320503. Expiry: Jan2022) around the time the rash started but after getting the vaccine. Her head, neck and back are very itchy. She mentioned that she waited 2 days and did not put this event in the (app name). She would have reported it yesterday, but she didn&#39;t get one yesterday. She also noted that it was very dry there and cold and a person is going to get dry skin.  She does have an allergic to metal and wondered if that was in the product. In her neck area, it looks just like when she would wear a cheap necklace. No treatments received. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit.  The patient has no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient had not yet recovered from events rash/like a fever type rash and congestion in one nostril/stuffiness; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

However, it isn&#39;t on the list of side effects but I&#39;ve had hot flashes every few hours since about and  2 hours after my first dose injection.  For the most part they are mild but come on every 1 to 4 hours while I&#39;m awake.  I had a terrible one like I&#39;d never had before where I was soaked through my clothes almost exactly 24 hours after the shot the following day.  They are still occurring now 72 hours after the shot.  they are mostly bothersome and will hopefully subside in the next few days.  Other than that I only had the normal local tenderness on my arm.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL8982, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Jan2021, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and urinary tract infection (UTI). Concomitant medication included amlodipine; ciprofloxacin; losartan; metformin; metoprolol; insulin human, insulin human injection, isophane (NOVOLIN 30/70); insulin human, insulin human injection, isophane (NOVOLIN 70/30); rosuvastatin and unspecified antibiotics that was taken from 11Jan2021 to 15Jan2021 for UTI. On 24Jan2021, on the same day of vaccination, the patient broke out with some red rashes on chest and on face, on the bottom of face and got a lump on the back of ear and it was only on the left side were she took the injection. The patient stated, &#34;it&#39;s just on my chest, it&#39;s just red rashes on my chest and it has behind my ear that was the rashes I have. But it is on the left side only, it is not all over.&#34; The patient was wondering if it was normal to break out like that as it occurred on the same day she received the vaccine and asked what she should do. The date of the second dose was reported to be on 14Feb2021. No treatment was given for the events. The patient reported she does her blood sugar twice a day (unknown results). The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 69-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9264; expiry date: unknown) intramuscular in the left arm, on 01Feb2021 between 16:00-16:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical History included Right-sided Breast Cancer over 30 years ago. No lymph nodes were involved, so she didn&#39;t need chemotherapy or radiation. She had breast reconstruction and right mastectomy performed. She also had 2 hip replacements. Other medical history included nerve disorder and car accident. She has had bad nerves since she was 18 years old. She said she hasn&#39;t worked in over 30-something years because she worked so much to raise her kids by herself and send them to college. She said her psychiatrist and a doctor told her she had to stop working. She walks 5 miles every day and has no underlying conditions. Concomitant medications included an unspecified nighttime medication for her nerves and pain medication because she was in a car accident. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EK9231) in the left arm, on 11Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The patient did not have previous immunization with a Pfizer vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The vaccine was administered in a Field. The patient reported that she got her second Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 01Feb2021. After she got the second COVID-19 vaccine shot she was okay for a while, then she had a little injection site pain immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine injection. She said the injection site pain was gone, clarifying if she mashes the injection site, the injection site doesn&#39;t hurt. She was only able to have shots on her left arm because she had a right mastectomy, so she can&#39;t have anything on her right side. On 02Feb2021, the big boom hit, and it has been all day. She has been breathing well and has no temperature. On the same day (02Feb2021) the patient experienced run of pain that pops up here, and there, and everywhere. She had a headache, as well. She was concerned if should take anything for the pain. She does not want to do what is not right. She wanted to do things the way that Pfizer has suggested. She put heat around face, neck, and arms, but now the pain was going down her body. She has been microwaving rice in a bag and using the heated bagged rice to apply heat to her face, neck and arms. She had a physical recently with unknown results, but she had no recent blood work. The events did not require emergency or physician visit. Outcome of the event injection site pain was recovered on 02Feb2021, while for the other events was not recovered.

Upon wakening the next morning, the site was warm, red, raised and itchy.  It looked like a red hive, about the size of a 50 cent piece and upper arm was slightly swollen.  Third day  the redness spread across the arm, warm, sore and swollen.  The redness was going down into the elbow to wrist area.  My arm was quite swollen.    I contacted my PCP, and had a video conference that day.  I also sent photos of my arm to a chart website.   He saw my arm and ordered Prednisone 20 mg for three days; as he felt it was an allergic reaction to the COVID injection.  Also was instructed to continue with Benadryl, Tylenol and ice.  It took nine days for everything to subside.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9262, Expiration date: Unknown, NDC number: Unknown), intramuscularly in left arm on 26Jan2021 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included thyroid issues, back issues, she had done some reading and she has allergies to some antibiotics, one of them being sulfa, allergic to bicillins, she has a whole host of antibiotic allergies which she investigated prior to receiving the vaccine and she was told it wasn&#39;t an issue. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously took azithromycin (ZITHROMAX), levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN), omeprazole (PRILOSEC), levothyroxine and experienced allergy to all drugs. The patient did not receive prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient did not administer additional vaccines on same date of the Pfizer suspect. It was reported that the caller received her COVID-19 vaccine yesterday at 14:00. She had no problems at all. She was feeling some itching on her face, arms, head on 28Jan2021. She was wanting to know was there any kind of sulfa product in the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller confirms she had no problems at all with the administration of the vaccine. She didn&#39;t feel a thing. It was very organized. The caller states the itching began about an hour ago on 28Jan2021. Caller clarifies she actually received her first vaccine on 26Jan2021 14:00. On her vaccine record card, she sees EL and the third digit was either a 9 or 4. She was able to look at her husband&#39;s vaccine card and it looks like a different person wrote on his and she sees &#34;EL9262&#34; on his card so she assumes that was what was written on hers. Caller explains she has thyroid issues and back issues, but she considers herself to be in pretty decent health. Caller states she received her first Pfizer vaccine dose 2 days ago and today around 5 pm started itching in her scalp, ears, head, face, neck and a little bit in my arms and legs. No rash. Allergic to sulfa, also allergic to &#34;the cillins&#34;, caller states she did her research before she got the vaccine. &#34;Enquired was there any sulfa in the vaccine or not.&#34; No investigation assessment. The patient did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. No relevant tests. The outcome of the events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 69-year-old female patient (wife) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number reported as &#34;ELI283 or EL1283&#34;), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure (abnormal) and cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medications included blood pressure medication and cholesterol. The consumer was reporting on behalf of his 69 year old wife. She received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 30Jan2021. On 06Feb2021, she started to experience itchiness, a rash, and a big area of redness on her left arm which was the injection arm. He stated he heard that the second dose can cause more side effects and he stated they both experienced arm soreness after the first dose on an unspecified date. Consumer stated, first of all thank you guys for making this vaccine. He and his wife received the vaccine (unspecified vaccine) their first dose last Saturday, a week ago yesterday and had no reaction to it at all, their shoulder was a little sore but that&#39;s it. Yesterday night, last night his wife noticed that the arm where she had the vaccination it has like a rash and he knows this online that Moderna has something called COVID arm but it doesn&#39;t say anything about Pfizer. He meant it&#39;s not to bother it itches a little bit you put some anti-itch cream on it wasn&#39;t a big deal. He was kind of concerned about the next you know they got the next one coming on the 18th, so, does she should change arm, do it on the other arm. Consumer added that that would be fine, he knows you guys want to know if there was any reaction so that you can log it in and that was basically why he called. They were going for their next shot they were going to the hospital and there were professionals there so pretty much ask them what they should do. Should they change arm or nothing to worry about if they do it again that was not the problem he just wanted to let you guys know that there was some kind of reaction a rash. Consumer stated he just put Cortaid cream on it and itch went away. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work on 27Jan2021: doctor did for cholesterol, blood pressure reasons and everything was fine. The outcome was recovered for the event itchiness; and unknown for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021170691 same reporter and drug, similar events, different patient

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of NT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 08:30 (Lot Number: ER8727; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021, at age of 69 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies: Penicillin, Ampicillin, hair color product. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She was allergic to Penicillin, and Ampicillin. As a child, always reacted strongly to any vaccination she was given with a fever and flu like symptoms for a couple of days. With Ampicillin, she thought she was having a heart attack. Was told to stop Ampicillin immediately because she could get a heart attack. This was when she was 25 years old and she never went to the ER. She was allergic to a hair color product in the 1990s and it made her scalp itch really badly. Was given a cortisone shot, which she reacted immediately breaking out head to toe in hives. Has no NDC/LOT/EXP for the vaccinations she reacted strongly to as a child. Stated this was in the 1950s or early 1960s. Clarified she did not have a heart attack with Ampicillin, but it felt like she was having one. Has had cardiograms per her request and her heart and heart walls are perfect. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine at 8:30 a.m. this morning on 26Mar2021. Caller reports around 11 a.m., she experienced excruciating leg cramping going from her buttock down behind her knee and rolling to the inside of her thigh, states that the pain lasted 15 minutes. The patient reports the same pain occurred on the opposite leg around noon and lasted for 15 minutes, states that &#34;the pain was so excruciating that she could barely stand up and it was so agonizing it was unbelievable.&#34; The patient noticed that the inside of her thighs were a little red on the side, both legs from her thighs to her knees. The patient states that she has not been in the sun, and didn&#39;t think it was anything alarming, but this is abnormal for her, states that she received the vaccine in the right arm and her upper torso is fine and her head is clear, asked if anyone else had reported this reaction. She was planned to received the second dose on 16thApr in the early afternoon. The patient stated the COVID shot was already fogging her mind. The patient felt pretty good after first shot. Felt nothing. Fifteen minutes before leaving the diner she got a leg cramp. Was sitting in a booth and didn&#39;t think much of it. Attributed it to the way she was sitting. Around 11AM when she got back to her garage, she was in agony. It hurt from the top of her rear all the way down the side to the back of her knee and rolled to the inside of her thigh. She was in such agony and didn&#39;t know if she could get out of her chair and walk. By the time she reached her apartment it has subsided. An hour later, same thing happened in the left leg. She was laying in bed and texting because she didn&#39;t&#39; know if she would get any other reaction. This leg cramp was even worse. She was in tears. Got off bed to try and walk it off. Initial leg cramp happened in right leg. Was excruciating. Both times it lasted for 15 minutes. Both cramps were from her buttocks, all down to her knees, and rolled over into her thigh. Didn&#39;t know if that was a reaction. It is not typical of anything written on Pfizer&#39;s information or that she had heard. She was concerned. Heard about blood clots, but not with this particular product. Stated second leg cramp subsided. If it hadn&#39;t, she wouldn&#39;t have gone to the ER. Leg cramps was so excruciating. Originally thought it was coincidental and stated she will be 70 on (Date withheld). To say she has never had leg cramps before would be a lie. The way the leg cramps were timed was kind of weird. It was absolutely the same kind of cramp and location just on the a different leg. Weight: Gained 25lbs. Doesn&#39;t have COVID or any symptoms. Tested three to four months ago and was negative. Received first dose COVID-19 Vaccine today, 26Mar2021, at 08:30AM. First leg cramp began 11:00AM in right leg. Second leg cramp began Noon in left leg. Each time lasted 15 minutes. Not having leg cramps right now. Could barely talk when having leg cramps. Was worried about getting clots in legs. Otherwise she would think it was because she was getting older. She doesn&#39;t get leg cramps very often. Doesn&#39;t know when the last time she had leg cramps prior to today. Nurse technician at vaccine faculty stated caller&#39;s allergy history wouldn&#39;t be a problem and she only had to sit for 15 minutes. Received the COVID-19 Vaccine and hardly felt it. Waited for 15 minutes. She was fine until 11AM. She was fine now, but her arm might get a little stiff tomorrow. Arm was slightly tender. Surprised she felt something in her legs. Doesn&#39;t know whether to associate it with COVID-19 Vaccine or not. Has nothing to complain about in the upper torso or from the waist up. Wants to know if this is a reaction or coincidence. Stated she expected to have a stiff arm. The outcome of the event &#34;Cramps in legs&#34; and &#34;pain&#34; was recovered on 26Mar2021. The outcome of other events was unknown.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 29Mar2021 at 09:20 (at the age of 69-year-old) at hospital facility as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no relevant medical history. Patient reported that she has people in the family that have had heart problems. Concomitant medication included unspecified vitamins. Historical vaccine includes first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9990 or EM9890) administered in the right arm on 08Mar2021 (at the age of 69-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and had a little fast heart rate but not constant, little fatigue and site pain. The patient previously took steroid injections 2 years ago (2019) and had heart palpitations before. The patient further mentioned that normally after the steroids wear off, the heart palpitations go away. The patient reported that she did not have any problems following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she had a little fatigue and site pain for just a couple of days but that everything was fine. Patient reported that she felt a little heart palpitations for maybe a day or two and then it was gone following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. After she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, she noticed the heart palpitations again and a little shortness of breath. The heart palpitations and shortness of breath were nothing that she felt that she had to run to the emergency room or anything over. The patient reported that now it was getting difficult for her to sleep sometimes at night because of the heart rate. The patient also reported that she was trying to figure out that from this length of time between her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021 and time of call on 14Apr2021, could the heart palpitations be a side effect from the COVID-19 vaccine. Patient also mentioned that when she experienced heart palpitations before, a whole work up was ordered and she was referred to cardiology and that nothing was found during the work up after previous experience with heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that she has been fine, that she has been able to work and walk and that she gets her 10,000 steps every day. After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, she was tired and didn&#39;t feel like her normal self. The patient also reported that when the time had arrived to get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, about a week before, she may have had a little fast heart rate but not constant. It was also reported that following her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, the fatigue started about the same time as it did following the first dose, on the second day post-vaccine on 30Mar2021. Patient reported that she was kind of tired and just taking a nap during the day. The fatigue was still ongoing. It was also reported that patient was starting to feel better other than the heart palpitations. The patient reported that yesterday, 13Apr2021, she felt great and could do her normal routine, other than feeling chest pains and palpitations. The heart palpitations are not constant, but are more regular during the day than she was used to. The heart palpitations were really bad last night, 13Apr2021, and that she had difficulty sleeping because of heart rate (couldn&#39;t hardly sleep at all). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for an echocardiogram. The patient&#39;s doctor did an electrocardiogram (EKG) on her on 08Apr2021 and there was nothing there (normal). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for a stress echocardiogram. The patient also mentioned that after returning from the physician&#39;s office, her husband went back and looked at the symptoms from the COVID-19 vaccine information sheet. The patient reported that her husband thought that she needed to call to eliminate everything, that they are trying to figure out why the patient was experiencing the heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that 2 days ago she got on her treadmill to walk and went for 30 minutes. Patient reported that it normally takes her 5 minutes to recuperate, but that time it took her 20 minutes before she felt comfortable after her walk. The patient also reported that the site pain was nothing serious following both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The site pain began shortly after receiving the vaccine and went away after the second day following both vaccines. The shortness of breath probably started about 5 days after she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The shortness of breath wasn&#39;t enough that she felt that she needed to run to the emergency room. It just felt like when she would breathe, especially at night as she normally breathes with her mouth closed at night, the patient felt like she had to open her mouth to breathe because she can still feel the pressure in chest. The patient was still experiencing the heart palpitations. The heart palpitations are a little worse because they happen so often. Patient reported that initially, she would have a few heart palpitations and then go for hours with none. Patient reported that now, she was feeling the heart palpitations quite a bit. Patient reported that it feels kind of like a little pressure in her chest and then it&#39;ll feel like little flutters. The patient further reported that she experiences a little pressure in her chest when she experiences the heart palpitations. At times, the chest pressure would go away, but she always feels the chest pressure there now. The chest pressure has gotten worse over the past couple of weeks and that she was thinking that it would go away like the first one did. Patient reported that she went to the doctor last week and was given an EKG. Patient reported that the EKG was fine and that her physician was scheduling other tests to make sure it&#39;s nothing with her heart. The patient didn&#39;t think that the heart palpitations and shortness of breath were from the COVID-19 vaccine, but that her husband looked at the vaccine information paper after her doctor&#39;s appointment and said she should call Pfizer. The patient had not yet recovered from heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pressure while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

Patient was travelling with husband at the car when she experienced warm/hot cheeks, flushing and concerned with history of previous reaction. When patient arrived ( approximately 835pm), patient sat down on the chair. The redness started to extend to her neck and it was then decided to place the patient to the stretcher. Vitals signs were done in which the BP was 183/104 and 174/101 (845pm). The redness spreaded to her forehead and neck. Benadryl 50mg PO was then given (847pm). Patient BP was taken again which was 182/122 , pulse 80, RR 24 (855pm). Patient then complained about pressure in her throat, eyes (right eyes slightly swollen ) and face. It was then decided that epinephrine (859PM) be used but unfortunately the trainer box was removed so the epinephrine was not actually given. The BP documented was then 193/112 (0859PM). EMS  was then called as the epinephrine was administered per protocol. EMS arrived (0910 PM) and BP at that time was 230/112, pulse 70. Patient was started with heart monitor and IV. EMS then took her to the Emergency across the street with husband.

The patient stated on 16Jan2021, &#34;I had the COVID Vaccine on the 14th (14Jan2021). I had just pain on my arm, no side effects. But today I noticed that I had a red spot where I had the vaccine and it was itchy, so I had, but it is mild. It is nothing that&#39;s all over me, I have got a rash or anything. Just on the side it looks little red and itches and it still hurts and when I touch it, I do feel like a little bit of a bump, little bit.

A 70-year-old female patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (Vaccination site: left, almost her shoulder) on 14Jan2021 13:45 as COVID vaccine. The vaccine was administered at clinic. Vaccine not administered at military facility. There were no concomitant medications. Patient had no prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient previously took acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), ibuprofen and NSAIDS wherein she was allergic. This was years and years ago. When she took the products, she had silver dollar size hives from head to toe. Patient asked if there was any of this in the vaccine. The patient previously got shingles vaccine on 2019 (2 years ago) at the pharmacy wherein she had a sore arm and a bruise. The patient had no other relevant history. Patient reported she just got home from the emergency room. It was explained that on 14Jan2021 (yesterday) she got the vaccine. On 15Jan2021, her arm had been sore today since getting up but about 1pm today she looked like she had a sunburn all over her body. Her husband gave her 2 diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and rushed her to the emergency room. They told her that they can&#39;t say for sure but that was likely that it was caused by the vaccine. The soreness was about the same. Looking like she had a sunburn all over her body, that was gone. The patient further explained the sunburn looking skin felt like her skin was on fire and her clothes itched, they felt like she had sandpaper on. There have been no other treatments. She remarks she had to wait so long in the emergency room by the time they saw her it had resolved. Investigation assessment/relevant tests were not performed. The emergency room told her the Benadryl likely knocked it out. They offered Tylenol and an IV but she declined; she felt there was no reason since she was doing better. She was told to take 2 more diphenhydramine 25mg in 6 hours.  No physician office visit required for the events. She was supposed to get the second dose on 04Feb2021 but was told to ask if she should still get it. The outcome of arm has been sore was not recovered, while other events recovered on 15Jan2021.  Information about lot number and expiry date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took shingles vaccine for immunization and experienced shingles. The patient reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night and into 18Jan2021, she felt scratchy in her throat. She did not think anything of it because the temperature change was not unusual in the patient&#39;s state and so she thought it was that. But, on 19Jan2021, her throat was more scratchy and then her nose started running more. By Wednesday, 20Jan2021, her nose was like a faucet, non stop, clear and her throat was definitely scratchy and she was sneezing non stop. Her injection site was sore too which she totally expected. Now, her physician has given her a steroid pack and did a rapid test, which was negative but the following day they are doing a PCR test, so, she will see. She also stated that she can still smell but can&#39;t taste and that started last night, 20Jan2021. She asked if they were seeing these. And if this was listed or being reported and if she should get the second dose. She went on to state that &#34;I would not call my symptoms severe and I&#39;m having my PCR tomorrow, but when they mention to me that they have had other patients with this experience&#34;. She also asked if it can it give her COVID since her symptoms were similar to COVID and other people are having symptoms. She also reported that 4 months ago, she got her first shingles vaccination and &#34;it knocked me on my butt, I still haven&#39;t got the second injection but I got shingles&#34; and asked should she have gotten the COVID vaccine if she just got over shingles 3-4 weeks ago. She reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 and her second dose is scheduled for 30Jan2021 (17days apart). She did not have a question about the timing of the vaccine, only mentioned when her second dose was due and the it was 17 days after the first. She wanted to know if Pfizer was seeing a lot of this, and it could this her body reacting to the vaccine. She wanted to know what she should do with the second vaccine, if she should get it. She works at a school and has been making sure to wash her hands and everything. The outcome of the events Rhinorrhoea, and Vaccination site pain was unknown. The outcome of the event ageusia was not recovered while the outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082498 same drug/event, different patients

                                                My reaction began typically enough, with a sore arm and chills.  The chills subsided by the evening, but symptoms continued and migrated from there.  The arm remained sore for 3 days and then began to itch.  This itchiness continued on and off for the next 2 days.  My neck and shoulder were also sore.  The shoulder continued to be sore for about 4 days.  I had an intermittent headache, also  for 4 days.  The worst part though, is the nausea, which also comes and goes.  But it can last for many hours and now, even after 8 days, I am still experiencing this.  I can find nothing in the writings about this vaccine to corroborate this side effect and I am therefore worried about the second shot.

About an hour after is when her arm starting getting sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), lot number not reported, via an unspecified route of administration from 21Jan2021 to 21Jan2021 as SINGLE DOSE (first dose) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included none.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient is a 70/yo female who is very concerned that she &#39;took half of a Tylenol Migraine&#39; yesterday morning before receiving her first dose of Pfizer-Biontech Covid19 vaccine.  She stated she came home, started reading on the internet, and is worried now that the dose won&#39;t be efficacious.  She also reports a sore arm and wants to know &#39;if that&#39;s a good sign&#39; of immune response. She also stated that her doctors &#39;don&#39;t know, and told me to call you&#39;.  Got the first dose of the vaccine yesterday. About an hour after is when her arm starting getting sore. It got progressively more sore throughout the day. This morning it has improved but is still sore when she raises her arm. Treatment: Took Tylenol. This was before she read this article. The nurse was the one who told her to take Tylenol. She goes for her second dose on 11Feb2021. The patient got the first dose of the COVID Vaccine yesterday. Before she went to get her shot she was getting a migraine so she took half of a Tylenol Migraine. She read that if you take Tylenol before getting the vaccine that it can effect the efficacy, the patient was asking if this was true.  The outcome of the event was recovering.

                                                Low platelets; Rash on her body; Bruising; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus since 2011 (reported diagnosed 10 years from this report, ongoing congenital heart defect which patient was born with but did not find out until she was in her 50s; does not bother her too  much; one of the major arteries has a 90 degree angle vs. an S curve, mild multiple sclerosis; no longer has this as she has not had another relapse; she was diagnosed almost 30 years ago; she has never had another attack since she had 2 of them and was on medication that did damage to her liver, breast cancer; patient is a breast cancer survivor and issues with magnesium levels. There were no concomitant medications. On 28Jan2021 the patient had blood work done for her kidney doctor. They withdrew blood from her arm. They had a hard time stopping the bleeding afterwards. They finally got it to stop and put regular cotton balls and a band aid on it. By the time she was walking out she was bleeding out of her arm she felt in her coat. They were able to stop the bleeding again. This was at about 10 AM. Patient went home and afterwards was called back and instructed to go to the ER for critical care. Her platelets were low at 10,000 at that time. They got to the ER and they checked her platelets and they were down to 8,000. They administered some steroids; Prednisone. They decided to admit her after giving the treatment in the ER. After that her platelets came back to 11,000. The next morning on 29Jan2021 her platelet count was 7,000. They started administering the same drug through an IV. He thinks it was still a steroid. They did it in smaller amounts and overnight the next day her platelets were up to 26,000 on 30Jan2021. They continued the treatment during the night again and on Sunday they were 36,000 and they released her that day late on Sunday. They went back and did blood work yesterday on 01Feb2021. The local doctor said her platelets are up to 61,000. The patient was getting blood work every Monday and Thursday for 3 weeks. Th patient had blood work and platelets checked before the vaccine and they were normal. The patient was hospitalized from 28Jan2021 to 31Jan2021 due to the event. The patient also noticed rash on her body and bruising maybe on 21Jan2021 or 22Jan2021. The bruising was really bad on her left hand by her wrist. It was really dark. She was also bruised everywhere they poked her with an IV and bruises where they put the heart monitor on her and pressed down to stick it to her. The bruising is still all over her body. It has stayed about the same. The one on her hand is still severe. The other from where she has been poked are starting to clear up. Overall it was about the same. The outcome of event bruising was not recovered, low platelets was unknown while rash on her body recovered on unspecified date.

A 70-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot: EL3248, expiry 30Apr2021), intramuscular on 23Jan2021 08:15 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization (prevention because she has autoimmune). Medical history included Behcet&#39;s syndrome and Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, both are overactive immune system problem/autoimmune diseases, which were diagnosed 20 years ago; diagnosed allergies; compromised immune status; respiratory illness; genetic chromosomal abnormalities; endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity; and patient have had shingles before. Family history was reported as none. Concomitantly, she was just taking daily medications that were not relevant. There was no prescriber for the vaccine.  It was through a hospital. It was reported that vaccination was given at 08:15 to 08:30. Patient had no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). No additional vaccines administered the same date of the Pfizer suspect.  Patient had not had prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Patient received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. She stated, on Tuesday 26Jan2021, patient was hurting on the waist around the back. On Wednesday, 27Jan2021, that next morning, she went to see her internal doctor and they thought a kidney infection or not; he was not sure if she had a kidney infection or what was going on. Patient went home and it got worse and patient went to the ER (Jan2021), also reported as ended up going to the ER. They did a CT scan gave her medicine. They did a CT scan and said it was not her bladder or anything (Jan2021). They thought it was diverticulitis; nothing helped. They gave her medication and she kept getting sick (2021).  No further details provided on medication given. On Friday, 29Jan2021, early morning, patient went back to the ER, they did another CT with contrast it wasn&#39;t diverticulitis, but it was shingles, and patient have had shingles before, this was the 4th time. It was reported that when the doctor came in, he thought this was shingles and she has had shingles previously. She has had it about 3 other times and the pain was just off the scale (Jan2021).  Her blood pressure went up to 211/92 and they were giving her morphine for the pain (Jan2021).  She was questioning if she should get the second dose. She has two autoimmune diseases and it was an overactive immune disease.  She took the one vaccine and her doctor said to contact Pfizer being as it is kind of new and especially since she has the autoimmune issues.  She would like to know if it is safe for her to have the second vaccine.  She does not know if she will be over this.  She does not feel well (Jan2021).  She was afraid of taking it if it will be any worse (Jan2021). Patient felt all right until she had the vaccine, on Tuesday the problem started (26Jan2021). They were giving her medication for the shingles and for the pain. Patient stated that &#34;it set something off&#34;. Patient was still sick (2021), still taking pain pills. Patient didn&#39;t know how many days she has. Her second vaccine is on 13Feb2021. As sick as she has been, and her overactive immune system and if she still has the shingles those can last a long time, she doesn&#39;t want to go through what she went through. This was a lot of pain and with shingles they can last, 6 months or a year. The nurse called her back and told her to report to Pfizer. Patient was taking the medicine for the shingles right now. She doesn&#39;t know what will happen. She doesn&#39;t want to be sick. Patient asked for the efficacy after 1 dose and how much protection it has. She did fill out something because she talked with someone else.  She confirmed it was through VAERS and not with Pfizer. She said the pain around her waist was a little better because they gave her the medicine for shingles and she has pain pills. She said one was Valacyclovir and she could not remember the name of the other. Patient had required two trips to ER.  First one was on 27Jan2021 and went to internal medicine doctor and that night went to the ER.  They did CT scan and it was not bladder or anything. Second visit on 29Jan2021 and did CT with contrast and the doctor thought it was shingles since she had shingles three times before.  She has had them internally.  The doctor said it would not necessarily need to be externally break outs.  The next two times she did not break out.  She did not have anything around her waist. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events hurting on my waist around the back, kidney infection, diverticulitis, shingles, and sick. The outcome of the event hurting on my waist around the back was recovering. The outcome of the event kidney infection, diverticulitis, shingles, sick, blood pressure went up to 211/92, does not feel well, and &#34;afraid of taking it if it will be any worse&#34; was unknown.

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either.

Relevant medical history included anaphylaxis with insect bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took codeine and diazepam (VALIUM) and experienced hyperkinetic reaction. The patient stated that she received the vaccine on 14Jan2021, and that day 6 hours later, she had headache, fever, chills and body ache; and the next day on 15Jan2021, when she woke up, she had rash on legs, arms, chest and stomach, and she still had the rash. On an unspecified date, the patient had 3 days with out sleeping. The patient assessed the events as non-serious. The patient further reported that she was hyperkinetic and she has had that reaction many years prior reporting, before when taking codeine or VALIUM, one of the ingredients in VALIUM.

The patient had the appointment for the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, this coming Thursday and wanted to know if there would be a problem to get the second dose. She was afraid to get the vaccine the first time, because she had a history of anaphylaxis with insect bites. She carried an epi pen, and the vaccine provider had one too and the paramedics was there, and everything was okay; they were nice with her. The patient didn&#39;t have any problem until later. The patient spoke to her health care professional and he thought it was okay for her to get the second dose and the health care professional just told her to put a cream on her rash. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rash on legs, arms, chest and stomach, which included putting a cream on her rash. The patient was not recovered from the rash on legs, arms, chest and stomach, while the outcome of the events &#34;headache, fever, chills, body ache, and 3 days with out sleeping&#34; was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

I did have aches and pains and bad headache and chest pressure for hours during the night which I reported and which disappeared next day.  However, the site pain in my right arm continues and is pretty bad temporarily and also periodically.  Not a big deal but decided to report it.  Seems very odd since it&#39;s been so long.

                                                diagnosed with shingles (on Scalp); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 09:00 in left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included CAD (coronary artery disease), allergies: cosmetics, some topical meds, preservatives in eye drops and some perfume. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) at 40mg, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) at 81mg and fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA). The patient historical vaccine included varicella zoster vaccine rge (CHO) (SHINGRIX) and shingles vaccine (unspecified) for shingles, and previously took codeine and experienced allergies: Codeine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 03Feb2021 22:00, the patient experienced shingles (on scalp). The patient has received both the Shingrix Vaccine and the earlier Shingles Vaccine. So, it doesn&#39;t make sense. The seriousness criteria were considered as non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has been not tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of diagnosed with shingles (on scalp) included valaciclovir 21 tablets. The outcome of the event shingles was not recovered.

                                                Shingles; she can suffer with the pain; blisters; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number EL3249 and Expiration Date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at left arm (age at vaccine was 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed about 8 years before unspecified date, ongoing hypertension diagnosed about 7 or 8 years before unspecified date.  The ongoing concomitant medications was not reported Hydroxychloroquine from two years before unspecified date at 200mg tablet, one tablet twice daily, by mouth for Rheumatoid arthritis; Losartan from probably 7 or 8 years before unspecified date at 100mg tablet, one tablet, once daily by mouth for Hypertension; Chlorthalidone from about 7 to 8 years before unspecified date at 25mg tablet, one tablet, twice weekly, by mouth for Hypertension and other unspecified drug. There is no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Patient experienced Shingles on 26Jan2021. Patient can suffer with the pain in Jan2021. The blisters from Jan2021 had dried and they are scabs now, but patient still has pain. Patient is due for the second COVID vaccine this Wednesday, and she is a little hesitant to get it because she does not know if there is a connection between the vaccine and getting Shingles. Treatment was received for all events (taking medications). The outcome of shingles is recovering (Improved but also Persistent).

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

She added she was monitored for 15 minutes post injection but when back to work, at (Retail Company), where she started &#34;itching on the right side of her ankle and leg&#34; and it &#34;was red&#34;. She called the ER that same day who recommended her to take &#34;Benadryl 50mg&#34;, which &#34;helped smooth it over and put [her] to sleep&#34;. She explained she went back to work yesterday, Thursday, and &#34;last night [she] was itching&#34;. She specified applying some &#34;hydrogen cortisone cream which eased it, but it is still itching and red&#34;. She asked if she should take the second dose of the vaccine given her reaction to the first dose. She said she will consult with HCP. She went to orthopedic doctor on 10Jan2021 who gave her a Toradol shot and unknown injection in the knee; she thinks the unknown injection was a steroid or whatever they call it for the pain in her knee because she has bone on bone osteoarthritis. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 03Feb2021. She reported allergic reaction onset after that dose administered on 03Feb2021. She asked if she should still get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 related to this event. Onset same date as vaccine administration. Further described: they let her sit there in the (Facility name) for 15 minutes for monitoring and she had no reaction. She left there and went to work at (Retail Company). She got lunch while at work at (Retail Company) and sat in her truck eating lunch. That is when her right foot started itching right up by her ankle. She went on back into work. She told them she had to leave because she was itching so bad all over, her arms and stuff so she went back home. She also reported pain in the areas itching. She called the (Hospital name) and told the lady she was itching real bad and her ankle was turning red. The lady told her to take Benadryl, so she took 2 Benadryl tablets which helped the itching. After the Benadryl wore off the itching started again. She did not rest at all last night because of this event. She put some Hydrocortisone cream on the area because it is an anti-itch cream; the Hydrocortisone cream soothed it for a while, but then it started right back. She put a cold pack on the area because her daughter thought that might help, but the cold pack did not stop it, it just cooled it down. So she is seeing her Primary Care Physician today for this event. Outcome of the event pain was unknown. Outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot/ batch number: EN9810 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 (at 70 years old) at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient further reported that when she got her shot, she didn&#39;t read the paper, but it says, &#34;if you are on blood thinners&#34; and does that affect this? She takes blood thinners and other heart medications. She asked if any of her medications affect her shot, she has not taken any today and she wanted to ask about that. Her only concern is the possible blood thinner interaction with the vaccine. With regards to the second dose, patient mentioned they didn&#39;t schedule her yet because she had to check and see where to get the second dose. She wanted to be more educated for the second dose. The outcome of &#34;achy arm on the injection site&#34; was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Medical history included breast cancer from 1988 to an unknown date , ovarian cancer from 2015 to an unknown date , she has had lymph nodes removed from her right arm &#34;30 years ago&#34; from 1988 to an unknown date, pass out from unknown date to unknown date. Concomitant medication included olaparib (LYNPARZA) taken for ovarian cancer from Feb2020 at 150mg, 2 tablets in the morning and 1-2 tablets at night by mouth.She says she is a little person and couldn&#39;t tolerate the side effects of that, so she varies how many she takes based on her side effects. She says she is supposed to take 300mg in the morning and 300mg at night. She says how she takes it is, she takes 150mg or one pill in the morning, then one or two at night depending on how she is doing. Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1, lot no: EL9264, route left arm for Covid-19 immunisation. Past drug history included on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out. The patient reported approximately 15 hours after the shot, on 21Feb2021 she had muscle spasms almost to seizure amount of shaking, full body muscle spasms. She clarifies that her side effects didn&#39;t kick in until 02:30AM on 21Feb2021. She says at 07:00AM on 21Feb2021 she got up and went into the bathroom and passed out, and had a low blood sugar episode she supposed.  She crashed unconscious to the floor. She said that could be from the shot, but she is also a high risk patient, a cancer patient, and is on a maintenance chemo drug. She says on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out, so she doesn&#39;t know if that was related to the COVID shot or not. No testing had been done on high risk patients, so she thought maybe this could be a good heads up for something someone else may experience. Her side effects were on and off for several hours, the shaking and spasms would subside and then start again. She says that they went away, and then she got up and passed out, and her foot was all messed up, she doesn&#39;t know what she did when she fell, but she had it checked and it was not broken, it was all bruised and swollen, but it was not broken. She says this was her right foot. She says she thinks she fell backwards, and she thinks she caught her foot under the vanity.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN6206, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 10Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. Medical history included allergy to bees and spider. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine in 1974 and experienced pharyngeal swelling. The patient said that she wanted to report that she has had a reaction to the COVID vaccine. She received the COVID vaccine on 10Mar2021, that morning, and she had noticed a reaction that evening around 8:00 PM. It started out about the size of a quarter. She took Benadryl and then she went to bed. When she woke up the next morning, her reaction went from the injection site all the way up to the top of her shoulder. It was red, the size of a tennis ball and it was swollen. It is still a little bit red, but not near like it was. It does still hurt a little bit. She got her daughter to take her to the emergency room and from there she was placed on a medication and she has been on that medication ever since. She has no intention of taking the second COVID vaccine. Clinical outcome of cellulitis and vaccination site reaction was unknown while for the other events was recovering.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal. Outcome of the injection site pain was recovered on 01Mar2021, of the difficulty breathing was recovering, of the headache, chills, fever, dizziness, weakness, and felt sick was not recovered, while of the remaining events was unknown.

This 70-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6200, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 18Feb2021, 12:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). The patient was not pregnant. Medical history included colon polyps and diverticulosis. Allergies to medications, food, or other products included premarin, ambien and many seasonal allergies. Co-suspect medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN) for diverticulitis. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included acebutolol hydrochloride (SECTRAL), allopurinol, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) and amitriptyline. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9262, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 28Jan2021, 13:00 pm at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 70 years). No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 18 Mar2021, 4 weeks after second vaccine, the patient took Augmentin for recurring diverticulitis. For the last few years, the patient has taken the Augmentin once or twice a year to treat the problem (alternative to the flagyl/cipro regimine) and she have never had any problems. This time, on the 3rd day of the Augmentin, the patient broke out in large hives, (palm sized) and had swollen earlobes and a swollen palm on her right hand. The next day on 19Mar2021 she had swollen upper and lower lips. The patient took lots of Benadryl and Zyrtec, and by the 5th day her hives and horrendous itching went away. The patient does not know if the vaccine played any role in this at all. She just thought she should report since prior to the vaccine she never had a problem with Augmentin. The patient had absolutely no reaction at all to the Pfizer Covid vaccine itself after either of the doses. No covid prior vaccination and no covid tested post vaccination was reported. The outcome of all the events was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 70-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EP6955), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 22Mar2021 at 16:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EN6198) on 25Feb2021 at 15:00 on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and reported that her blood pressure went sky high and it continued to be high and her heart rate was up and caused her to go to urgent care. The patient also previously received a flu vaccine on an unspecified date and her arm was sore for 3 weeks and she felt like she had the flu for 3 days. The patient reported that after she got her second vaccine she had the normal, what people call normal reaction, of feeling sick and stuff on 27Mar2021 then she ended up in the hospital her blood pressure was way up, it was at 188 and she forgets what the bottom number was. She went in because she felt like she was having a heart attack there was a pain in chest like right where the middle of a bra would be. It lasted about 15 or 20 minutes. That is her experience with the vaccine, it is raised blood pressure and she is still dealing with it her blood pressure is still high. She tries not to be scared but the doctors at the hospital made her a little nervous that is why she spent the night but that is a definite side effect. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 27Mar2021 and was discharged on 28Mar2021. They wanted to keep her for 2 nights and do a stress test and she said no way she is not staying for 3 nights in that hospital, the nurses were outstanding they were the most efficient nurses but the hospital food sucked and she got no sleep. Also, on her right arm she has a hidden rash between her hand and her elbow under the skin there is a rash that popped up with the vaccine on an unspecified date in Mar2021. The patient also stated that her blood type is O negative and she does not know she heard that O neg people weren&#39;t going to get COVID and she has never got COVID before. The patient also reported that they drew blood 6 times in the hospital to see if she had a heart attack and everything came back negative. it just so happens she had a echocardiogram the day after the first dose was given and her blood pressure was elevated that day but everything was fine. She says it is not relevant but she tested for that out of precaution, her doctor asked her to do that every 2 years and just so happened to fall on the day after the first dose. The patient received treatment for the events she ended up in the hospital her blood pressure was way up, it was at 188, felt like she was having a heart attack and pain in chest. The outcome of the event she ended up in the hospital her blood pressure was way up, it was at 188 was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

He states that she complained of arm pain at the injection site that evening (4/14/21) and went to bed around 9:30pm because the pain was excruciating. He said around 2:00am, she woke up stating she couldn&#39;t breathe. This has happened before, so she went and sat up in the living room which helped her last time. For whatever reason, she then went into her bedroom where he said she fell out. He noticed foam coming from her mouth and called 911. EMS was unable to revive her. She passed away at home.

                                                hives; face swelling; itching; rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 71-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EH9899), intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 11:08 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing depression. Concomitant medication included atenolol (tablet, strength 50 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for blood pressure high, simvastatin (tablet, strength 20 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL, tablet, strength 40 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for depression. The patient experienced hives, face swelling, itching and rash on 27Dec2020. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. She got the first Covid 19 dose on 22Dec2020 and was fine, then on 27Dec2020 she had hives, itching, and face swelling for several days. Caller stated her lungs were clear and she was okay other than the extreme itching. The face swelling was what worried her. The hives and itching went away within about 36 hours. The face swelling kind of got worse for a couple of days before it went away. Caller verifies she recovered from the hives/rash/itching within 36 hours. She got a steroid shot and things like that and it went away pretty quickly. The face swelling was completely gone but did last for a good 5 days. She didn&#39;t know if this reaction was related to the vaccine. She wanted to call and let Pfizer know and see if there was any reports of anything else like that or similar to that type of reaction. She was not sure if that really matters or not except she was not sure about taking the booster. She was kind of leaning towards taking the second vaccine. She didn&#39;t have any breathing issues. She asked as far as the second dose after those side affects, was it recommended? Her doctor said she could get the second one and prescribed her an Epi pen and would give a dose of Benadryl at the time of the second vaccine. She may take some Benadryl before getting the second vaccine and have her EpiPen with her just in case. She hadn&#39;t seen her doctor about this experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She only went to an urgent care. The caller stated she went to urgent care twice. She received a steroid shot but doesn&#39;t have any name, NDC/UPC, Lot number or expiration date for any of the medication she received. She probably threw that paperwork out. She knew she wasn&#39;t given anything the second time she went to the urgent care. The second time she went back was because the face swelling was getting worse. She was prescribed an EpiPen and was told to take Zyrtec which did help. Everything had gone away. She would consider these events to be medically significant because of the face swelling, it kind of scared her. She made the comment she was taking high blood pressure medicine and cholesterol medicine, but other than that she was very healthy. She was not really an allergic person. She had not had any testing done since she received the vaccine. She did have bloodwork done prior but not since the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work prior vaccine with unknown result. The outcome of hives, rash and itching was recovered on an unspecified date of Dec2020 (within about 36 hours); face swelling was recovered on 01Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time gap between the vaccine and the events there is not a reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to the suspect product,  events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 06Jan2021 09:40 at a single dose as COVID vaccine. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications noted as on other medications but nothing new. She previously got the shingle shot for immunization then her arm hurt a few days. She had no other reaction to vaccines in the past. She received no vaccine on the day of or in the prior 4 weeks. Last Wednesday on 06Jan2021, the patient took the vaccine and has had a headache since; even touching her head hurts. She had a persistent headache that started the day after the vaccine and has continued since. The next day on 07Jan2021 was when the headache started. She took regular Motrin (lot OFE3249A, expiry: May2022) and Tylenol extra strength (lot: LMA051, expiry: Jul2019, perhaps not working anymore) sometimes but they didn&#39;t really seem to help. She felt the best when she was standing up or laying down, and she would rather be laying down. She asked &#34;Is this a normal side effect, am I dying? I am not a headache kind of person, I take a Motrin, it goes away and I do not have one for months. It actually hurts to the touch.&#34; Should she be worried? She did call the clinic about the headache and was told if it got serious to go to the emergency room, she didn&#39;t think it was that serious. It was just persistent. She could leave with the pain if it kept her from getting COVID but the fact it was persistent worried her. It was also reported that on 06Jan2021 with this shot her arm really hurt when getting it and that day but that was all (pain in the arm the shot was given), the next night there was no pain. Her and her husband both oooo&#39;d and ahhhh&#39;d with the pain in the arm but that was it (a very uncomfortable pain they experienced in their arm after receiving the injection). She asked how long a side effect lasts after the vaccine? She also stated that on Jan2021, they insist on giving the next dose in 4 weeks. Asked if the vaccine was given a week later would the efficacy be lower? The outcome of persistent headache was not recovered; of vaccination site pain was recovered on 07Jan2021; and of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021036651 same reporter and drug, different patient and AE

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EJ1686, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 11:00 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arm soreness from flu shot 2-3 months ago. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on her left arm on 31Dec2020 as she works with elderly at nursing home and she was of age. Two days after her shot, on 02Jan2021, she experienced little headache which lasted all day but was gone by the following day. On 12Jan2021, 2 days ago, when she woke up and got of bed with severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint which lasted for maybe 10 minutes. It was so severe she could hardly get out of bed. Currently, she had no joint pain. The right shoulder and right hip pain were so odd she thought, but it has also improved since. It&#39;s been 2 weeks and she never had this happen before. This lasted a little while, but thought it was from the cold weather since it&#39;s been 2 weeks since having the vaccine. She still has a bit of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose on an unspecified date. She mentioned this to her supervisor and was encouraged to call and she wants to know if this could be a side effect. The patient had no vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. She had the flu shot before in past and the area would be sore for a few days, but now with this Covid vaccine this arm was still tender. Also, she had gotten the shingles shot the same day as the flu shot but that was about 2-3 months ago, at least 2 months ago. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Covid vaccine. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the first administration. Outcome of event headache was recovered on 03Jan2021; severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint/it was so severe she could hardly get out of bed was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose was not recovered.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), intramuscularly on the left arm on 09Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes: diagnosed before 2000, the condition was controlled; ongoing blood pressure high: diagnosed about the same time as the diabetes (before 2000), the condition was controlled; breast cancer twice: first time she had breast cancer was in 2008, the second time was in 2017; and had surgery and lymph nodes were removed: four lymph nodes were removed on the side where the shot was done (left). There patient had no concomitant medications. On 19Jan2021, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes, lymph nodes were really itchy and the itching is worse/worsened in Jan2021. The patient received the COVID vaccine 10 days ago (also reported as almost 2 weeks ago) and experienced swollen lymph nodes. The vaccine was given to her in the same arm where she had her lymph nodes removed. She added that within the last 2 days, her lymph nodes on one side were swelling and really itchy. She added that &#34;it&#39;s itchy to the point she would like to rip her arm off&#34;. The patient was scheduled to have her second dose on the 30th. It was explained to her that she shouldn&#39;t have a problem with getting the second dose, but the vaccine was injected into her left arm and that was the side where her lymph nodes were removed and now it was itchy. The swelling and itching started first thing in the morning on the 19Jan2021, she woke up with it. The itching was worse, or she doesn&#39;t know actually. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s worse or its just annoying because it has now been 2 days of it. The itching and swelling hasn&#39;t gotten any better. Initially she was thinking it was a bug bite. She was thinking it would be better today, but its not. She wanted to make sure it had nothing to do with her breast cancer. The consumer wanted to know how long it took for the swollen lymph nodes to go down and should she take the second dose of the vaccine. She also wanted to know if she should take BENADRYL or apply any ointment on the swollen lymph nodes. The adverse event did not require a visit to the emergency room or the physician office. No relevant tests were done. The patient has not recovered from the events.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 19Jan2021 08:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. She was sick (COVID symptoms) all Dec2020 when she was with her sister who had COVID-19. She does not know for sure that she had COVID 19 because she was never tested. She recovered from that illness about two weeks before getting the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine first dose. The cough was all gone before she had the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the vaccine on 19Jan2021, two days ago and had not had a problem. She left there and went to the gym for 1 hour afterwards. Then yesterday morning she woke up and has been sick ever since with a cough and chills. She never tested positive for COVID but she was with her sister who had it during Dec2020. She had a cough similar to the one she had in Dec2020 when she was quarantined for COVID symptoms. She was not expecting anything, but it says you can have side effects if you have had COVID-19 so she was calling in about that. On 20Jan2021 she woke up at 02:00 in the morning with a cough; injection site pain which was not sore before; headache; muscle pains, chills; joint pain; fever, but not a high fever; feeling freezing cold; and nausea. She reported &#39;cold, chills, fever, ache&#39;. She felt a little bit better today on 21Jan2021. She was scheduled to receive the second dose on 15Feb2021 at 08:15. The patient would like to know whether her history of COVID symptoms from Dec2020 may have aggravated her post-vaccination symptoms. The patient would like to know whether there have been other reports of similar post-vaccination as hers. The outcome of the events cough, injection site pain, headache, fever and feeling freezing cold was recovering; event muscle pain, joint pain and nausea was not recovered; event chills was recovered on 21Jan2021; and unknown for the other events.

Red area in a circle around injection site.   Measures 2.1/4&#34; in diameter.  Went to MD.  He said could be a very delayed reaction or cellulitis..  Said I was the 3rd person in 2 weeks who had come to see him with this type of what he presumed was  a delayed reaction.   Said  he looked at CDC articles and could not find any reference to this type of reaction.  As a precaution I was prescribed Keflex for possible cellulitis. MD said wait it for a few days and take ATB if site gets bigger.  Also mark with a pen on my arm the current size of red area so could determine if it gets larger.  1 day later site was much bigger but slightly less red: now looked like a cloud shape, size now measured 2 1/2 &#34;  by 31/2 &#34; at the largest point.  still hot and red.  I never took the ATB.  Eventually all subsided by today 2-23-21.  Just minimal red area left.

                                                10 days later arm got red; soreness to her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has a question about the COVID-19 vaccine. She stated that she thought she had a simple question, and she called the COVID hotline, and the CDC and they just keep bouncing her around. She said she had her first dose of the vaccine on 16Jan2021, and wasn&#39;t bothered by it, she had just a bit of soreness when she touched her arm (unspecified date in Jan2021), but 10 days later, on 26Jan2021, her arm got red, so she is wondering if this could be a delayed reaction. She stated that she is not having bad effects, she is just wondering why it would pop up after so many days. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Today is fourth day of rash and it seems to be getting lighter in color and does not itch as much. I read an article about this symptom and it is reported as &#34;Covid Arm&#34; 8th day delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction. Should go away.

Rash appeared on 2/22/21, mostly on the tops of her feet and her face. A few very mild patches on her body. She has been taking Benadryl and has used Cortisone 10 on the itchy areas. She says what alarmed her was that her eyes felt dry and tight. Nose was also puffed up and felt a slight sensation in her ears and teeth. No tightness in throat or difficulty breathing. No swelling in lips or tongue or throat. She has no redness at the injection site.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: E13247) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included A-fib. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS). Had COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021 and everything was fine. Had a headache and a little bit of malaise on 20Jan2021. After two days was ok. On 21Jan2021, broke out in what she thinks was shingles. Not 100% sure if it was a major rash or shingles. Wanted to know if that was a possible side effect. Patient was taking Valaciclovir (VALTREX) for Shingles. Doctor suspected it was shingles, but it was possible she had shingles brewing before the COVID-19 Vaccine or the COVID-19 Vaccine brought the shingles out. Second COVID-19 Vaccine is scheduled for 09Feb2021, patient was scared and afraid of it. Doesn&#39;t know what to do. On 20Jan2021 she was very tired and had a headache. Next day was ok. On 21Jan2021 thought she had bug bites. Started itching. Then it began traveling and she realized it was not bug bites. She started experiencing burning. Went to two Urgent Care and her Internist. Was told it was basically shingles. Her internist was on the fence because she just had the COVID-19 Vaccine and wasn&#39;t certain. Caller stated it was ironic that she broke out after the vaccine. Caller&#39;s internist stated for any rash it would be treated the same with Valtrex. Internist stated chances were the rash was viral so if it&#39;s not shingles, would be treated with Valtrex. Rash and Itching: Wasn&#39;t very bad on Saturday, 23Jan2021, which was the first time she had someone look at it. On Sunday, 24Jan2021 it was full blown and really blossomed. Was initially treating rash as if it was bug bites. Was applying Benadryl tropical. On Sunday, 24Jan2021, started taking Valtrex. Outcome of the events headache, malaise, fatigue was recovered on n unspecified date, while unknown for the other events.

A 71-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 (at the age of 71 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation; and paracetamol (TYLENOL), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dose and frequency for an unspecified indication. Medical history included high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, tinnitus, vertigo, blood cholesterol. Concomitant medications included amlodipine for high blood pressure, lovastatin for blood cholesterol, meclizine [MECLOZINE] for vertigo, dipyridamole for tinnitus, prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis, and folic acid. On 21Feb2021, the patient experienced rash (hospitalization) and fast heart beat. &#34;If this is the reaction, I guess I shouldn&#39;t take the second dose, right? I just think that I am not going to take second dose.&#34; Both the events required emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work, electrocardiogram (EKG) and x-ray and everything came back normal on 21Feb2021. Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the rash which included hydrocortisone. The action taken in response to the events with paracetamol was unknown. Outcome of both events was recovering.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

A 71-year-old patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: Unknown) via an unknown route of administration on 12Mar2021 at 11:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in airfield where they build airplanes. Medical history included spleen removed many years ago due to enlargement from the blood disorder. Also had ongoing spherocytosis (States takes B12 and Folic Acid for this condition), ongoing sleep disorder, ongoing narcolepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome. She got pneumonia and respiratory failure after pneumonia vaccine and was hospitalized for 6 weeks. This happened years ago. She was almost died. So she avoids vaccines. Concomitant medications included ongoing methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) for sleep disorder and narcolepsy (20 years), folic acid for spherocytosis, cyanocobalamin (B12-VITAMIIN) for spherocytosis. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine on 12Mar2021 at 11:30 (Friday as reported). In the evening she started experiencing some reactions (caller states she got the paper with the side effects and it mentions that they are usually worse after the second dose of the vaccine); chills, hives, headache and extreme fatigue on 12Mar2021. She is still very tired (crippling fatigue) and her headache is not so bad. She felt fine until around 1700 of the same day, when she experienced chills, hives, headache, became very tired, couldn&#39;t stay awake and went to bed. The next day she still had a headache, was still tired, hives were gone. At this time, just the extreme fatigue is continuing. States that today she is so tired she cannot function. Also mentions that she did not get a vaccine card from the facility that administered the vaccination. States that she is sorry that she got the product because she has a history of chronic fatigue syndrome and wondered if this would trigger it; but that her doctor said it would not. Caller feels that it has, because she can&#39;t function and this is terrible. She was afraid to get the second dose if she felt this crappy after the first one. She had no soreness or anything from the injection. With this amount of fatigue, she is just exhausted. States she has not been seen by her doctor, did not expect her doctor to do anything. A visit to emergency room or physician office was not required for events. Events were reported as medically significant. Specific causality was not provided for each event by the reporter. The outcome of event hives recovered on 13Mar2021; for events headache and fatigue was not recovered; for other events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal assosciation, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events,chills, hives, headache, extreme fatigue ,somnolence and cannot function cannot be completely ruled out.

Patient received first dose on 17Jan2021 and second on 05Feb2021. It was reported that the patient has been having joint pain starting from 19Feb2021 and it fluctuates from one joint to another so if the patient&#39;s shoulder is affected, the joint pain goes to the other side and then to a different joint such as her knee joint. The pain was continuous, and it doesn&#39;t disappear. Reporter mentioned that it gets better with medication but it&#39;s still not going away. Regarding patient&#39;s treatment, it was reported that in the beginning, patient was taking ibuprofen but now the doctor switched it to naproxen (ALEVE) and also added hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen (NORCO). Reporter mentioned that sometimes not only the patient&#39;s joints gets affected, patient also experienced difficulty chewing, but it goes away and then comes back.

Reporter added that the eye floaters started more in the last one week. They do not know why this is happening, if it was vaccine related or not. The medicines the patient takes shouldn&#39;t be causing these, but they don&#39;t know if it was the medicine causing it or if it&#39;s the vaccine.

                                                cellulitis; fallen; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 27Feb2021 (Lot:EN6198, expiry:30Jun2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation; and potassium, via an unspecified route of administration, start and stop date, batch/lot number and dose were not reported for an unspecified indication. Medical history included ongoing non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Concomitant medications included atenolol taken for cardiomyopathy, magnesium (MAGNESIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, and furosemide, potassium chloride (LASIX &#43; K) taken for an unspecified indication. The patient was diagnosed cellulitis and was prescribed with cortisone and antibiotics, she was taking 2 antibiotics, named one as Bactrim and unable to name second one, possibly Cefaxin. She was prescribed with prednisone now. She was wondering if the prednisone would interact with the vaccine. Patient had blood work and everything was normal, including new blood tests yesterday. Went off a particular medication, had been on a high dose of Magnesium because she was taking Lasix and Potassium so this test was checking all of that. She hasn&#39;t heard back regarding the test yet but is not anticipating any problems. Patient wanted to know if she should take an antibody test to determine if she already gained immunity then she could take her prednisone. It was also reported that about 5 or 6 days before her second shot, which was this past Saturday, she went to her orthopedic doctor and got 2 shots of Cortisone, 1 in each shoulder. Patient had fallen a week before her doctor thought there was a hairline fracture not picked up on the first X-ray. Stated she was supposed to start prednisone and was reading the pamphlet. Patient wanted to know if this would interfere and if taking steroids after the vaccine will interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 71-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198, expiration date: 30Jun2021) at the age of 71-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder on 05Mar2021 at 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included neuropathy in feet caused Tamoxifen (chemotherapy), anal cancer stage IV, breast cancer, double mastectomy, chemotherapy, and lymph node in left arm. Concomitant medications included gabapentin, meloxicam, and vitamins. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date with the COVID-19 vaccine as well as within 4 weeks. The patient previously took tamoxifen as chemotherapy and experienced neuropathy in feet. The patient received her first COVID-19 vaccine on 05Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021, she experienced severe pain across the front of her stomach. On 19Mar2021, she said she has something, and it was a rash. She went to care facility on 20Mar2021 and was told she has shingles. The patient stated that the doctor just looked at her and said she has shingles, no testing was done. They told her it was ok for her to get the second shot, but she was worried about that. She experienced shingles since 13Mar2021, she still has it. She was supposed to have the shingles vaccine 4 years ago, but it was expensive. Her son heard on the radio that the shot may cause shingles, it may or may not be related but she wanted to let Pfizer know. The rash was starting to go away, and the pain was not, but the pain was far better. She ended up going to the doctor on 24Mar2021 with severe pain in her head since Mar2021, and she didn&#39;t know why. It hurt to touch and had shocks and her whole body would cramp up. Her daughter told her she looked like she had Tourette&#39;s, it was happening every 2-5 minutes. The doctor couldn&#39;t do anything and told her what she could take. It was an additional thing and the doctor said it was probably from shingles but she did not have a rash there. It was completely gone now. She received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8727, expiration date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder on 26Mar2021 at noon and stated that it was getting better then, and by 27Mar2021 it was gone completely. She was petrified this was going to happen while she was there to get the second vaccine and they would say she couldn&#39;t do it. The outcome of the event shingles was recovering and recovered on 27Mar2021 for all other events.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 71-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 10Apr2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS), tamsulosin, and iron. The patient got her first injection on Saturday, 10Apr2021 at 1:30 pm in the afternoon around 7 o&#39;clock the same day she started to itch, it was mild across her breast and stomach but her thighs and bottom legs were turning red, swelling, hives there too, and she rubbed alcohol (treatment) on this to stop the itch, that seems to helped a little bit, but the swelling was not that bad today but the redness was still there. She has scabs on her, blood was coming through, and slight bee stings all over and thigh on an unspecified date, she used hydrocortisone cream (treatment), she was lucky she have some of that here because she keep that when going or here but she rubbed that on last night and that was the only way that she was able to get some sleep. The patient doesn&#39;t think that she was going to get the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to experience that again. It feels like that today it was not that bad itching today but at 71 that was miserable yesterday so probably she would not get the second shot. She hopes that the first one can protect her to a point, but she cannot subject herself to that again, that would be senseless for her to experience that again and get a second shot. The patient also stated that her eyelids have been a little itchy too so hopefully you all understand it was 71 years old was suffering from that kind of misery second time. The patient was unable to probe the more question, patient was in pain and not willing to proceed. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Feb2021 at 15:00 (at the age of 71-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago, obesity, asthma with bronchitis as a child, allergy to other medications, anaphylactic reaction to sulfas twenty years ago (also reported as 50 years ago), muscle hurt/sore arm usually when she got a flu vaccine (unspecified) once a year, allergies to makeup and clothes (diagnosed at least 50 years ago), heart beats fast, low thyroid and borderline high cholesterol. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for 30 years for low thyroid, nebivolol hydrochloride (BYSTOLIC) taken for 25 years, rosuvastatin calcium, (CRESTOR OD) taken for 2 years for borderline high cholesterol and insulin (unspecified). The patient did not receive any other vaccinations on the same day or within 4 weeks of the vaccine. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) as pre-medication since she had allergic reactions to some things and would get this before the flu shot; as well as salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA) for runny nose and coughing. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 28Feb2021, and &#34;they&#34; wanted to give her diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) after the vaccine but could not since she was driving. After the vaccination, the patient was not feeling well for 2 days (as of an unspecified date) and thought she was getting better. On 28Feb2021, the patient experienced anxiety. She was more anxious when &#34;that stuff&#34; appeared on the news on day 4 and 5 after the vaccine. She took a small dose of clonazepam 0.5 mg, dividing the pill in 4 pieces as she never took the whole thing. She took it when she got extremely anxious and tried not to take it because it can be habit forming. She may take it 3 times a week or in the middle of the night. It helped a little bit, but she still felt panicky and upset. She woke up feeling anxious. She did not normally take these medications. The patient reported that she experienced headache (constantly several times a week) and left arm sore at injection site, itchiness/ itching all over body (not constant but still happening) from 28Feb2021. On Mar2021 (day 4), the patient experienced dizziness (comes and goes and was not constant like it was), was very exhausted, nausea (tapered off after 2 weeks), diarrhea, some cramping in stomach, brain fog (still struggling and forgets to take her insulin, not as bad as when she first noticed), body aches. At first, the body aches were a pain in the left knee and left elbow and then moved to various joints and muscles. The left knee and elbow pain persisted without ever going away, but also moved to different areas. The calf muscle in left leg pain is also constant. The patient experienced pain in the joints and stinging pain in left leg (below knee down to ankle) from 04Mar2021, runny nose (tapered off) from 07Mar2021, and on an unspecified date muscle pain, back pain, fever, neck pain, pain in left arm. On Mar2021 (two weeks after vaccination), the patient had a red circle around injection site not all the way filled in, but rim around where she got shot. On Mar2021 (3 weeks after vaccination), the patient experienced a weak feeling in arms and legs and other times when she stood up her body felt heavy (persistent but not every day). The patient spoke with her physician who did not believe the patient about the symptoms and recommended she seek psychiatric help. The patient had not received the second dose of the vaccine because her physician did not recommend it. She was upset because her physician told her she could not get the second shot.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at left arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included low sodium, Covid-19 in Nov2020 (She had felt sick for a week and on 13Nov2020 she went to the ER and they did blood tests and she could not eat or drink for 3 days. She stated that she had 4 different IV fluids going and one of them was sodium and the other was for nausea), blood did not clot properly, broke her back. There were no concomitant medications.The patient had a unique reaction after receiving the Covid-19mRNA Vaccine. She clarified that she never had a reaction to a shot before. She received the vaccine on 31Dec2020 and was fine for the first 20 hours. She said that the next morning on 01Jan2021 at 0600 she woke up cold  and could not get warm. She said that she spent the next 24 hours to where she kept adding clothes and blankets to keep warm. She stated that she was freezing and the she felt like the interior of her body was freezing even down to her toes felt cold. She also had injection site pain and the arm felt heavy and stated that the pain extended from her shoulder down to her elbow. She stated that the injection site pain was kind of delayed. She had aches and pains. She said that some of the pain went from the injection shoulder and spread to the middle of her spine. She had nausea and total loss of appetite and could not even eat. Her aches and pains after the vaccine were similar aches like she had with the Covid. She said that she had a terrible headache when she had Covid though. She stated that after the 24 hours of receiving the vaccine she had a little headache, but she took a migraine pill for it. She said that she was able to shed clothes, but she could not take a shower, but within 24-36 hours she was back to normal like it all never happened. She said that was when she figured out it was like her hemorrhaging with one of her childbirths. She explained that she had 3 children and hemorrhaged with each of her child births and was going into shock with one of them and felt this freezing sensation due to blood loss. She thought that her reaction to the vaccine was so bad that she was either not making blood or there was an interference. There was some kind of weird interruption. She said that her blood clots break down from minutes to hours after her child birth or with dental procedures. She had a PAI-1 deficiency or Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 deficiency. She said that there was also something deeper that her doctors had not figured out yet too. She said that her blood did not clot properly. She said that she did not bruise or anything, but she was not allowed to have internal surgery without a transfusion. She said that her doctor&#39;s started to figure this all out after she broke her back before. She went to a hematologist and had her counts checked regularly. She said that she was being studied by 127 different clinics. She gained 10lbs, but she was very physically active. This was her first dose of teh vaccine. She said that her doctors told her that she needs to be under 48 hours of observation if she gets the second vaccine. Her primary care physician recommended that she did not take another mRNA vaccine. She said that she was taking their advice and canceled her second dose appointment. She said that when she had Covid-19 they did a Chest x-ray on 13Nov2020 and she had low sodium. She said that they gave her tramadol at the hospital for her headache, but she had already taken 3 migraine pills that day. She had already had her flu shot and read somewhere on a website, that mRNA vaccines might cause unstable anticoagulation. She wondered if it could be possible that Covid-19 antibodies interfered with her injection? The outcome of events was unknown.

It was around 13Jan2021 or 14Jan2021. It happened in a matter of seconds and she thought she was seeing things, then it went away. It was red and raised and was gone within 5 minutes at the most. It was weird. She said that she thought it was a mosquito bite. The patient stated that her back was itching like crazy. She stated that she put alcohol on it and it went away. Her son sprayed her back with a fragranced alcohol and it started burning. She also had a slight dull headache in Jan2021 and she had never had that in her life.

I felt worse so I went to bed and slept 14 hours. I  felt better Saturday morning.  That evening I noticed a rash on both legs, from ankles to my knees. It is still there, though it  doesn&#39;t itch or make me feel sick.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 14-JAN-2021 at the 72 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included COPD so sometimes she would cough, kidney stent, rheumatoid (&#34;two&#34; Tylenol and 20 mg prednisone for &#34;her rheumatoid&#34;). The concomitant medication was clarithromycin (MACROBID) from an unspecified date to 12Jan2021. The patient got it on the 14Jan2021. She says she had been doing fine she didn&#39;t know now. She was a retired paramedic so she usually felt things out, she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching on 14Jan2021 but she did not think anything of it. Friday evening she had a good time eating some walnuts and she woke up about 2:30 itching that was Saturday morning before day, she took Benadryl and went back to sleep later then later on she was itching a little again in the palm of her hands and she just took a Benadryl and it went away. Then Sunday night, last night, she was okay so she decided to go to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl, they had no Benadryl and she only had old Benadry. Then about 12:30 she started itching on her bottom, itching on her arms and she was scratching. She noticed she was having some face soreness in Jan2021 but she was using some expired facial cream so she thought that was why her face was sore so she put some hydrocortisone cream on it. Since she was itching she decided to take a little of her nieces Benadryl, it is pediatric Benadryl. She was itching so she called her doctor and she heard him in the ER say they had too many people in there to tell her to go to the ER so she said okay. She hung up and called the pharmacy and they said it sounds like having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she told him she had the COVID vaccine but she doesn&#39;t think she was short of breath and she gave them her vitals her BP was 152/85(BP 157/85) that was high for her in Jan2021, but it came down, she took some Tylenol then it was 146/77, her pulse rate was 77 and her respirations were good she did not have shortness of breath or cough well she has COPD so sometimes she would cough. Then she got up and said let me go one over and get some Benadryl so she went by there got some good Benadryl and she thought she would call and see what they think about all this. She took the Benadryl at 10:25 and she is doing okay right now but she had whelps, she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching in Jan2021, it is on the left side of her hip, the cellulitis part of her skin that is mostly where she is itching in Jan2021. She remembers when she worked at the health department they would give Benadryl and Prednisone. She thought if the Benadryl does not help then she would call, then she decided she would go ahead and call to see what information they have. She says Pfizer is giving her alerts that she has been answering but she did not have the itching at that time. She retired from being a paramedic in 2009. She says she is 72 now but she woke up in 1985 and her lip was swollen like not totally swollen but her top lip was swollen more than the bottom in Jan2021. They gave her an Epinephrine shot and Benadryl and she is just wondering if this itching is related to the vaccine or if it is just an allergy that she may have come up on or something like to the walnuts or something. She says they went there and they gave the shot and they gave Benadryl but they are not sure. She said the doctor never figured our what it was that cause it and it never happened again until she did notice a little puffiness on her lip again this morning. She said the itching first started around 2:34 AM in the morning before light. It had improved since taking up to date Benadryl. She was supposed to get her second dose 04Feb2021. She didn&#39;t want COVID 19. She knew she just came off, she had a kidney stent and she had stopped taking 2 days before, she was taking Macrobid. She was not taking that right now. She took a lot of other medications but the Macrobid she was just on and it was stopped on Tuesday 12Jan2021, 2 days before the vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if the Macrobid would interfere with getting vaccine. The outcome of the event itching was recovering, the other events was unknown.

On Wednesday, I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours. On Thursday, my face continued to burn with redness and a rash.  I then started to get a low grade fever and it appeared my face was swelling and then we decided to go to Urgent Care.  The Doctor said my face was swollen and gave me a 1/2 dose of a steroid shot and a prescription for steroid pills.   I saw my Primary Care Doctor 2/8/21 and he said I should not get the second dose of the vaccine.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of 2 reports.  A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at the right upper arm close to the shoulder on 02Feb2021 07:30 at single dose as she doesn&#39;t want to get COVID again or give COVID to anyone else. Medical history included metabolic syndrome from 1994 and ongoing, it all started when she was 46 and it runs in her family and it was a genetic thing; ongoing diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed when she was 65, so 7 years ago; she had COVID in Nov2020 but it was just a very mild case and she just had a cough; and cardio artery problems. She takes a lot of medications and she has metabolic syndrome which includes cardio artery problems and diabetes, but she has taken all of those medications for a long time. The patient says she was calling to report a couple little concerns she has. She received her shot on Tuesday, 02Feb2021 at about 7:30 in morning and her arm started at about 2 to 3 in the afternoon and she noticed it was getting sore, but it was no big deal, she did not think anything of it, and on the second day she thought that was it and she was over it on 03Feb2021. She states her husband also mentioned that he had soreness in his arm after his vaccination. She says at three in the afternoon on 03Feb2021, she started feeling weak and shaky, but she didn&#39;t think much of that. She says this began around 3 to 4 when yesterday afternoon, 03Feb2021, she had a fever. She says she took her temperature and it was 100.4 and that all kind of was gone by the evening but when she woke up this morning, she was weak and shaky again. Today she got up and was weak and shaky and it never left, she was still weak and shaky. The patient mentions that she was diabetic so she can get weak and shaky when she needs to eat something, but she had just eaten, and she ate yesterday so she doesn&#39;t think it was caused by that. The patient says she thinks we should know that she was diabetic. She says then she could tell that she had a fever, so she took her temperature and it was 100.4 which for her was high. She states she didn&#39;t even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that&#39;s why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years. She says last night she took her temperature again and the fever had gone away in 30 to 40 minutes, so she thought it was over. She took her temperature again before she called this morning, 04Feb2021 and it was 99.2, which was still a little hot for her. She says for her that&#39;s a fever. She was 96 and 97 usually. The patient says she still feels like she has a little fever. She was not someone who usually has a fever and it can be just a little bit of a fever for instance like this morning when she was 99.2. Her eyes were still feeling funny and burning this morning and that was why she took her temperature this morning. The outcome of the event arm was a little sore was recovered on 03Feb2021; feeling weak and shaky was not recovered; fever and her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021162089 Same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient

                                                Too long to have muscle pain from a shot; Migraine headache; severe arm pain where the shot was injected; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9261; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration from 21Jan2021 to 21Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for an unspecified indication. Medical history included &#39;thyroid&#39; from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing at 100 ug, 1x/day for &#39;thyroid&#39;. Patient stated that she spoke with her physician&#39;s assistant. Patient received vaccine on the 21st of January, the first shot at her local place. The following morning at 4 in the morning, patient had severe arm pain where the shot was injected. So patient put a hot compress on it and took some paracetamol (TYLENOL). Patient mentioned that it didn&#39;t relieve for about an hour and a half. Patient meant the pain was really severe but finally it went away. The next day, it came back again and then the patient did it again and the pain keep coming back. Patient stated &#34;And now it&#39;s been tomorrow will be a week. And that&#39;s too long to have muscle pain from my shot&#34;. Patient also mentioned that second day after the shot, migraine headache started. Patient stated, &#34;Now I get them, but I only get them in the spring and I get them in the Fall. I don&#39;t get the migraine headaches in the winter time. I could only take Excedrin Migraine for the migraine, it&#39;s just over the counter medicine. And so I took that for the headache but those have not gone away either. When patient contacted her physician&#39;s assistant just now, it was reported that patient the physician&#39;s assistant is going to write a prescription for a muscle relaxer. Patient also reported that she is not going to take that second shot as she didn&#39;t know where to go to cancel it but she is not taking it. Patient mentioned she can&#39;t have pains like this. Patient stated that she can&#39;t tolerate pain to begin with, let alone have excess pain in her system. Patient added that she doesn&#39;t take medications. She is only on a thyroid medication (later confirmed the name as levothyroxine). Patient confirmed that the vaccine was Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. When probed for the due date of the next shot, patient stated &#39;February 11th at 12 o&#39; clock&#39;. Patient also stated &#39;I am not getting it, I am not taking the second shot. I didn&#39;t get you, I don&#39;t know what you said. I am not understanding you. I am not getting what you are saying. I am not taking the second shot, it is scheduled for February 11th of 2021, I am not taking it. Because they called and asked if I wanted to receive it and my age is almost 73. So, I thought I probably should give it a chance. But now with the reaction I don&#39;t want the second one&#39; and &#39;I don&#39;t know if there is something wrong with this phone or something wrong with the connection, I don&#39;t understand, I get part of it but I don&#39;t understand the other part. It blanks out, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, you are asking me something, but I don&#39;t know what it is&#39;. Patient also reported that the pain started the day after she got the shot, 22Jan2021. Patient is still having pain. Patient also confirmed that TYLENOL was the treatment for pain but it was not working. Medication for migraine was reported as EXCEDRIN migraine. Patient further confirmed EXCEDRIN Migraine did not help with the migraine and stated &#39;No, I still have it, it gives me some relief but then after wears off it comes back, the migraine comes back&#39;. Patient further added &#34;Okay, I am just going to rely on my physician assistant, she has got some medication ordered for me, a muscle relaxer. And I am going to try that and see if that will make everything go away&#34;.  Outcome of the events &#39;severe arm pain where the shot was injected&#39; and &#39;migraine headache&#39; was not recovered; outcome of the remaining event was unknown.

                                                aches; itching; kind of tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL9262, expiry date unknown) in the doctor&#39;s office, via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 at a single dose on the right arm as she was over 65, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus a long time ago since she was in her 60&#39;s, ongoing blood pressure, ongoing high cholesterol and cyst. Concomitant medication included ongoing losartan (manufacturer unknown) for blood pressure, ongoing pravastatin (manufacturer unknown) for high cholesterol, metformin (manufacturer unknown) for diabetes mellitus from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and ongoing sitagliptin (JANUVIA) for diabetes mellitus. The patient was also prescribed an unspecified antibiotic for a cyst which was taken 2 weeks before the vaccination. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced itching on 27Jan2021, the same day as the Covid 19 shot later in the day, after she got home. She didn&#39;t pay attention to it. The next evening she called her doctor and told him about it and he said it was one of the side effects of the Covid 19 shot and prescribed Benadryl. She started the Benadryl that same night, 28Jan2021. She should not have waited, she should have called the doctor the same day. She called the pharmacy and got the prescription, it&#39;s not that far for her. The patient stated that the the itching lasted a couple of days, it is gone, as of an unspecified date. She took Benadryl for the itching, it is the best thing for her. In all, she thinks she went through 2 to 3 days of the whole situation. The patient also stated that she took Tylenol for the aches and that got better. She had aches but the aches from the Covid 19 shot started on 28Jan2021. On the day of the report, she was a lot better. The aches went away but does not recall what day they went away. She feels much better that day. The aches were not severe. She added that the aches and itching lasted for 2-3 days and are totally improved, that they stopped on an unspecified date. State she was able to go outside that day. She added that she was kind of tired. She had to lay down one day because the itching and aches were bad. The outcome of the event kind of tired was recovering while the outcome of the other events was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number=EL3249), intramuscular on the right arm, at the age of 72 years, on 13Jan2021 09:45 at a SINGLE  DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included food allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient would like to know if the vaccine was derived from or does it have any products from Acacia. One of the reason&#39;s she was asking was because she knows it has Polyethylene Glycol in it. Her resources are limited. She was a retired healthcare provider and she taught graduate level nursing and has background in epidemiology and public health. The Polyethylene Glycol was in the vaccine, according to the prescribing information. Some forms of Polyethylene Glycol in some type of way are derived from gum acacia and she does not know if this is the case for the COVID vaccine. She did have 1st dose and waited 15 minutes. When her left eye felt tight and felt itchy, she took 2 Benadryl and then waited in car a little longer. She felt like she was going to go into what she has had in past 3-4 times relating to fish. She has had full blown facial swelling, intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch. Those times, if she had chopsticks, she would want to scratch inside her ear. She never had that with the COVID vaccine. They told her when she got the vaccine that if this develops further, she should go to her doctor or ER, but should not come back there. She did not want to go to the ER and sit there for 12 hours waiting to see if she was going to have a worse reaction, so she went home, took 2 more Benadryl, and went to bed. Eight hours later, she was fine and did not have hives. She then stated she completed report with Pfizer online and did not have a reference number for previous report. For those time when she had these episodes with the fish, she had extreme itching and hives. The worst allergy she had, her fingers looked like they were webbed. She was treated with Adrenaline, Cortisone and Benadryl by injection and that would usually stop the reaction, but it usually takes 3-4 days for the swelling to go down. In later years, if there is a piece of fish mixed in with fried shrimp and she inadvertently eats it, she knows it immediately. She will take Benadryl immediately. She will have facial swelling and swelling around her eyes. The Benadryl will contain it. She will be disfigured for 2 weeks, with bags of fluid in her cheeks. She is going for her second shot tomorrow. She can self treat with Benadryl. In 1994, she had a very positive wheels from an intradermal scratch testing for Acacia and codfish. The patient had an onset of burning and itching, periorbital. She took 2 25 mg Benadryl tablets. She has itching in ears and throat. After my 15 minutes waiting, she left. She had various hot spots of burning skin, legs and arms. Left eye felt like past episodes of itching, about to swell. Her skin had feeling of about to break out in hives. Facility said to go to provider or ER if got worse. She chose not to go to ER, and wait and be miserable for hours on end, while waiting for full blown body hives all over. She took two more 25 mg Benadryl and went to bed. She had intermittent burning skin, various areas, for several hours. About 8 hours later, was resolved. The patient was about to receive 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine. After the 1st dose she experienced an itchy feeling in throat, rotating heat in arms and legs, slight bag fluid under left eye and it felt to her like she was going to have an allergic reaction but did not. She took some Benadryl and after 8 hours she was fine. The patient stated after the first dose of the vaccine she had itching, severe tightness in her left eye that felt like it was going to swell up, and hot skin for several hours. She took two Benadryl while she was still in the waiting period and perhaps that blunted the reaction. She had hot flashes on the drive home. She took two more Benadryl at her daughter house (100mg total after taking 4 that day). She didn&#39;t feel good and felt she was on the verge of getting hives. She had episodes of hot skin and itching and after 8 hours it was over and done with and she was fine. She stated she is nervous about the second dose but stated they have what they need if she has an immediate reaction and it is worth the risk of getting vaccinated.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of left eye felt tight and felt itchy/severe tightness in her left eye (eye pruritus), intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch (ear pruritus), onset of burning and itching (skin burning sensation), skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over (urticaria). The outcome of the event onset of burning and itching and skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over was recovered on an unspecified date while other events were unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9262, expiration date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at left upper arm around 19:00 or a little later at single dose (at the age of 72-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included bad knees and got injections for this and recurrent cellulitis of legs (cellulitis was not active at time of vaccine; but anytime her leg swells with bad knees she had a little episode with the cellulitis down around her ankles on both legs but left leg was more predominant. She had been keeping it at bay), mineral supplementation, bad knee pain, blood pressure medication (abnormal), urine output control (abnormal), dehydrated and dizzy. Concomitant medication included lisinopril as blood pressure medication, potassium for Mineral supplement, solifenacin succinate for urine output control, paracetamol (TYLENOL 4) for bad knee pain. She had taken potassium before and it calmed it down: she was little dehydrated, little dizzy, so was drinking some Pedialyte, water, and taking potassium. The patient had it once before but it kind of snuck up on her again. The patient called to ask if anyone had reported any type of blood clot on the same side of the body that the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. She questioned if she might have a blood clot in her left leg after having been administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She had recurrent cellulitis in both legs prior to Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The doctor thought the cellulitis in left leg may be acting up and that she might have an infection in that area of cellulitis. She reported pain in the left leg when she rested her leg on a pillow; but did not feel any pain when she was standing and walking. The pain became a little too hard for her to bear so the doctor prescribed her Cephalexin 500m capsule every 12 hours-she was on the 3rd capsule now. Onset date for the events was approximately 03Feb2021 or 04Feb2021. The events were better since started Cephalexin. Second dose date scheduled for 22Feb2021 but did not give her time. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Follow-up (23Feb2021): New information received from the product quality complaint group includes confirmation of lot number (EL9262) and new expiry date.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

                                                Itching terribly; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 (lot number: EL3249 and expiry date unknown) at a single dose and then the second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 13:30 (lot number: EL9261 and expiry date unknown) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. She got the first shot on 19Jan2021 and about a week and half later, she started itching terribly for about 48 hours and was off and on, mostly at night. She got her second dose of the vaccine Tuesday, 09Feb2021 13:30, and she started itching terribly Tuesday night, around 19:00-19:-30 and she had been itching since. It is ongoing but has gotten better because she has been taking Benadryl. She called the place where she got the shot done and they said it was not a side effect, to call her internal medicine, doctor and she called them and they told to call Pfizer because they do believe it is a side effect. She is trying to clarify if itching is associated with the product. Outcome of the event was recovering.

A 72-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206) at left arm on 08Mar2021 09:30 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteoarthritis, nodules on thyroids and allergy to Aspartsme. No covid tested post vaccination. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication included pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PANTOPRAZOLE 40). the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient previously took Sulfanomide (Sulfa drugs) and had allergy (swelling), codeine and had allergy (nausea). The symptom that has made patient concerned enough to report the possibility of a side effect is: she had her shot this morning and between about 8:55 and 9:15 this evening she had 9 or 10 episodes of what feels like her heart quivering for several seconds followed 3 or 4 times by very slight pain, just below her right breast, she has never experienced such a thing before. (she took baby aspirin around 9:20 in case she was having some kind of heart thing). It&#39;s 9:45 pm, and the quivering episodes haven&#39;t happened for the last 30 minutes, so maybe they&#39;re all cleared up. Earlier, within 30 min of getting the vaccine, her ears started feeling like they were stopped up and her nose started feeling stuffy. Then as she was driving home she felt flushed and looked in the mirror and her face was red, she took one Sudafed in case it was allergies, and those symptoms improved quite a lot. Adverse event start date was 08Mar2021 10:00 AM. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Unknown if treatment received for ears started feeling like they were stopped up and nose started feeling stuffy. Outcome of what feels like my heart quivering for several seconds followed 3 or 4 times by very slight pain was recovered. Outcome of felt flushed and face was red was recovering and outcome of other events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                approximately 48 hours after receiving the first Pfizer Covid vaccine I noticed a small area of redness on my left clavicle near my shoulder, it was red and itchy.  Just thought it was dry skin and used some Eucerin lotion.  Over the next 3-4 days this redness spread across my chest and down toward my breast.  It became more red, itchy and irritated and started spreading up my neck. This went on for a few weeks and just thought it was dry skin irritation.  When the rash became more raised and looked almost like hives I checked in with  our clinic Family Practice doctor as my regular provider was out of the office.  It was about time for my second Pfizer Covid vaccine and I hesitated to get another shot with this rash getting worse.  Dr.  has started me on Mometasone Cream twice daily along with Benadryl and or Zyrtec for the itching.  The rash is fading and tolerable as of 1/21/21 but still remains.

                                                Started with join pain for a few days, started taking one Aleve a day. The muscles became extremely sore. Joint pain increased, involving shoulders, hands, legs, arms, knees and hips. Left hand began swelling on January 23rd and continued so I could no longer see my knuckles and it ballooned and it was hot and very painful. The knees were so bad it was almost impossible to stand from a sitting position and walking was stiff. Could not sleep laying down because pain in shoulders and knees would increase.   I went to the doctor on the 26th.   he prescribed Prednisolone for one week and I am scheduled to see him next Tuesday February 2nd.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed 15 years ago, maybe; High cholesterol diagnosed 20 years ago, she doesn&#39;t know, reflux diagnosed 20 years ago, maybe more, prediabetes and allergy induced asthma which she carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year. Patient reported that she was tested and they don&#39;t know for sure, but she reported that she may have allergy induced asthma as she has to take, carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year, in the fall when leaves are falling down, the leaves get moldy, and she was driving in her car, or walking in a wooded area, she gets tightness, takes her inhaler and was fine, that&#39;s the extent, no other circumstances; fall or she had where a plant was blooming outdoors, she gets tightness, and she took her inhaler, and was good for the next year, so sitting in the environment and nothing further materializes, if she takes the inhaler three or two times a year, considering what other people have, she thought this was insignificant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she got vaccinated this Friday and had nothing but a sore arm afterwards, on 16Jan2021 and was fine all day, evening, all day Saturday. She just had soreness at the site, she had no redness at the site of injection, but the weird part: she doesn&#39;t think anyone would believe, 33 hours later, at midnight, she was still up, on her way to bed, and all of a sudden she experienced extremely excruciating stabbing pains in her arm with the shot, it was stabbing, excruciating, and immediately at the same time, she had shivers/shivered and had a splitting headache, was freezing and had to put socks on, and had noticed very slight difficulty breathing, and since it was midnight, she didn&#39;t want to wake up her husband, she dozed off, and was up at 0530. She had body aches, slight, it was the least, but the stabbing stopped in her arm. She slept from 12:30 to 05:30, and the shivering and aches stopped, but the headache was still on, so she took a pill for the headache. She took the thermometer that marked 100F orally; she stated that the fever was higher in the night and she assumed with the shivering, she had a greater fever than 100. Also, the oximeter indicated 133 pulse and 86 of oxygen saturation. By 10:00, it all had resolved. She has an oximeter, and since she still had the feeling of difficulty breathing, she put it on, but her pulse was 133, that was when she was feeling better. It was reported that all symptoms were gone except for rapid pulse, it was 133 and the slight breathing, and her 02 saturation was anywhere between 86-88, it varied, and by 10:00, all issues resolved, her heartbeat was down to normal, her breathing was above 94, or whatever, everything was fine, and has been fine since then. Maybe she had fatigue on Saturday and Sunday, on Sunday was like after the flu, after you finish, you have fatigue and was a little out of it, this was on Sunday. On an unspecified date, the patient stated that she was shrinking and weight varies. Patient stated that the only thing she does have, says she has a cough, but because she needs a drink, she was not sick and she gets to drink water. She felt like the reaction she had was in the limit of a severe allergic reaction due to the rapid heartbeat and her difficulty breathing. She would like to know if there was information about these side effects reported so she can determine if she was going to have the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of events states she was shrinking, weight varies and cough was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was recovered on an unspecified date.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can&#39;t take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

Did a telemed appointment with her physician who told her to take one dose of the Epi-Pen, Benadryl, Prednisone, Ventolin, and Singulair.  These medications have worn off, and wants her to take even more doses of the Prednisone, Benadryl and the inhaler.  She is still having symptoms, but improving.  She does not itch as badly.  Her arm is sore.

                                                On Feb. 12th at 2PM symptoms started with lower back pain, pain in abdomen and stomach, cramping, chills, ear ache, pain level 8.  Felt sick all over, like having the flu and then whole body ached, not just GI track.  Left arm injection site was red, sore to touch, swollen (slightly).  Doctor couldn&#39;t get vaccination needle into arm muscle the first time and so had to try a second time.   Intense cramping of GI track started up again 8:45AM on Feb. 13th.   By 4PM Feb. 15th fever 102F, chills, felt freezing cold and had to wrap myself in a heating blanket.  Pain level 10, especially in pancreas. Fever broke around 2:30AM Feb. 16th and later when I was up at 8AM I felt very weak, faint, pancreas ached.  Pancreatic pain lasted another 3 days.  Pancreatic pain stayed around level 5.  On Feb. 17th took ibuprophen.  Pain level reduced to 1.   This was the only time that I took pain medication between Feb. 10th and 17th, because I am conservative about using Ibuprophen, Tylenol, and have a high threshold for pain.

                                                Tingling of fingers and numbness of left cheek.  Did not get any worse after 30 minutes. Extremely tired and sore arm that day.  Day 2 - tired easily, no stamina.  Dizzy and nauseous after showering at3:30 pm.  By 10:30, both hands were red and itched.  Sometime in the night woke with a very sharp, painful headache.  Did not last.  No real problem again until Saturday.  Nausea at 11:20 am.  Sunday I sat all day doing taxes - no symptoms noted.  Monday after walking - rapid heart rate and very tired after what is normal activity.  By 4:30 I was tingling all over my body.  Tuesday night my ankles are swollen for the first time in years.  Only happened that nigh.  Wednesday morning, the tingling is very strong in my calves. and I had a sharp pain in the area of my Achilles tendon.  I believe that the vaccine has exacerbated the neuropathy (undiagnosed) of the bottom of my feet.  Today I am reporting because I fell for no reason getting out of a chair, and the tingling is in my legs, arms, shoulders.  I had not heard until today that the vaccine could affect the nervous system.  The effects are the worst they have been and it has been one week since I had the vaccine.  Should I get the second shot?  Due March 11,2021.

Also had a headache for most of the day on the second day.   Four days following vaccine I started to notice the injection site was getting itchy, then on day Five it was increasing and started getting red, swollen, hot and itch increased.  Day Six it is still itchy, red, hot and swollen.  Red site is about the size of an orange. As of Day Six, No fever, headache or other symptoms and knee has returned to normal discomfort.

                                                I developed a rash (in the evening and continued all night).  The instructions I received was to seek medical attention. I went to  Urgent Care at 8 AM on Feb.25.  I was instructed to take one tablet Claritin and then 2 Benedryls in the evening.  By 5:30 PM on Feb 25 I was extremely uncomfertible and took two benedryls.  Still could not sleep and at 11:30 PM took 2 more benedryls.  When I woke up at 7:30 AM on Feb 26, the rash was gone and has been gone since.  I was also instructed not to take the second shot.  (Which I will not)

It goes down the shoulder and down the arm; tooth ache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EN6198, via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm (shoulder) on 03Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, blood pressure abnormal, thyroid problems, fall (fell a couple of years ago), and trouble with her shoulder (prior to getting the vaccine). She reported that she did have some trouble with her shoulder prior to getting the vaccine. She fell a couple of years ago and the doctor&#39;s x-rayed it and thought it was pulling away from the bone. They didn&#39;t have to do surgery. She was completely over that and it had resolved before getting the vaccine. Patient has no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included metformin hydrochloride, sitagliptin (JANUMET) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been taking it a long time over 20 years); glipizide taken for diabetes, start and stop date were not reported (been taking it a long time over 20 years); losartan taken for blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been on it about 10 years, her blood pressure is in between and it doesn&#39;t bother her a lot, it is not really high or low); and thiamazole (METHIMAZOLE) taken for thyroid problem from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been on it about ten years). Patient was calling because she had her first Pfizer shot about three weeks ago. About three days after on 06Mar2021, she developed pain in the right shoulder where she got the shot. It has been bothering her up until this time. She also had a pain over her heart area. The pain over her heart area occurred when she was breathing it. That has gone away. She had her second shot today and she was trying to explain to the doctor what happen to the right shoulder. He said the shot had to be in the other shoulder and he put it in the left shoulder in the bone. It hit the bone. She hollered because it hurt so bad. He said no one ever jumped like that before. She jumped because it hurt. She still has the pain in the right shoulder, but she doesn&#39;t feel anything in the left where she got it today. She clarified Pfizer shot as COVID19 vaccine. The pain in the right shoulder travels down the right arm. It goes down the shoulder and down the arm in Mar2021. She got first and second dose. She got the first dose of COVID19 vaccine on 03Mar2021. Pain in the right shoulder: it felt like her toothache has something to do with the pain in the shoulder. The toothache came on a little later (Mar2021) than the pain in the shoulder. The tooth ache is still ongoing, but it has improved. Pain over heart area: It started at the same time as with the pain in the right shoulder. The pain over the heart stopped about a week ago. She thinks she has recovered completely. She didn&#39;t have anything done for the heart pain. She got the second dose today, 25Mar2021, lot number: ER8733, Expiry date: unknown. The outcome of the events &#39;pain over her heart area and pain in the right shoulder travels down the right arm/it goes down the shoulder and down the arm&#39; was recovered, event tooth ache was recovering, and events &#39;pain in the right shoulder where she got the shot (vaccination site pain) and pain in the right shoulder&#39; was not recovered.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccine (because she&#39;s 74 and high risk). Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included irbesartan oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date (maybe 3 years ago) and ongoing at 300 mg once daily (150mg, 2 tablets once a day in the morning) for hypertension as blood pressure medication. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on Monday (11Jan2021) morning (AM) at 10 at the county (public) health department. She had no problem at all until yesterday Tuesday, she experienced mild swelling; the swelling happened in the upper left arm (swelling of left arm) which started on 12Jan2021, this was also the same side that she got her vaccine on, the left arm. On 13Jan2021 she woke up at 4AM [also reported as thirty (30) hours after the shot] in which she started to have severe chills (horrendous chills), could not get warm under the blanket for an hour and a half. It lasted a long time. Her severe chills did stop, she used an electric (heated) blanket. This morning on 13Jan2021 at 8:30, she woke up with the fever, which she was able to reduce with acetaminophen (did take two acetaminophen). Her fever was also gone. She was a little concerned because she thought her breathing was deep too on 13Jan2021. She did some relaxing breathing which helped. It lasted a long time. The patient also experienced a drop in blood pressure on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running the past few days at 133/80 on 11Jan2021. Today (13Jan2021), she took her blood pressure and it was at 93/50. It went to 87/56 after drinking some salty soup on 13Jan2021 (the bottom number in the blood pressure was going up a little, and the top number was going down a little). Her blood pressure has been normal 133/70 on Jan2021, but this morning it was 90/50 on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running normal the last couple of days like 133/90 on Jan2021. She was shocked it was lower. She knew they talk about dizziness and weakness, but she didn&#39;t experience that. She was concerned about that sudden drop in blood pressure. She did some research and started eating some salty soup and stuff (has been drinking salty soup). Her bottom number went up to 53 on Jan2021. She was concerned about that drop there. She was wondering if that was a side effect of the vaccine (result of the vaccine). She asked if drop in blood pressure was a concern. She had no positive test for Covid before the vaccine. She never had any tested, she&#39;s been pretty isolated. She had no antibody test. She has had no issues with vaccine in the past. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe chills/could not get warm, fever, her breathing was deep, and drop in blood pressure. The outcome of swelling of left arm/mild swelling and drop in blood pressure was not recovered; of severe chills/could not get warm was recovered on 13Jan2021 05:30 and fever was recovered on 13Jan2021; and of her breathing was deep was recovering.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 (in the morning) at a single dose as COVID-vaccine, she got it as a protection to her because she&#39;s elderly with underlying conditions. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included unspecified five prescriptions which she has been taking for a long time (nothing new). She has had no reaction to medications. Her diet was her normal diet. The patient experienced both cheeks were very rosy red on 14Jan2021 21:30. She wanted to know if experiencing very rosy red cheeks, on both sides, after receiving the Covid vaccine was a normal side effect. She received the first dose of the COVID Pfizer vaccine yesterday morning on 14Jan2021, everything was fine (good) at 7:30 p.m. Then at 9:30 p.m., while she was brushing her teeth, she noticed that both cheeks were very rosy red (her cheeks were rosy red). This morning, her cheeks appeared to be skin tone (skin looked normal). It was gone now; both cheeks were her normal skin tone and everything looked normal now. She didn&#39;t eat anything unusual the day of the vaccine. She was wondering if she should go back on 15Feb2021. She was going to ask her doctor and was going to notify her primary care doctor as well if she experiences any redness today or tomorrow. Investigation assessment was noted as no. The outcome of the event was recovered on 15Jan2021.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had her first COVID19 vaccine dose. Immediately, on 16Jan2021, she felt very cold and unwell. She also experienced dizziness, headache that started right after the shot, extreme fatigue that started later in the day and fogginess that started right after the shot. Strong chills was not going away almost like a feeling of ice in her veins. She is taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for these. The events were not improving. She was just surprised, she was ok with a day&#39;s worth, but it was hanging on dizziness (not enough to fall down), but she has to hold onto a rail to go upstairs which was not normal. She doesn&#39;t feel like she is real anchored. Headache was described as very bad and is not changing. Foggy brain was described as she was not able to focus very well. She was not able to get work done on Jan2021 due to extreme fatigue and foggy brain. She also experienced arm ache at the site on 06Jan2021 for which the patient expected. It is reducing some, the ache is not as bad as it was while the other things seem to be growing and it is still there. She had to be set aside when she took the shot, because she had these reactions after she got the shot. She had to be watched because of her almost immediate reactions. The patient wants an advice on what to do now, if there is any help for the side effects, and if this will go away. It was very disturbing and interfering with ability to do work. Outcome of the vaccination site pain was recovering while of the remaining events was not recovered.

                                                My mom only had site soreness after her covid vaccine on 1/21 which resolved within a couple days. However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

I have been wearing layered clothing.  There was a large (about 3&#34; diameter) pink spot around the point of injection.  I suspect this slightly raised pink spot has been there since Feb. 10, I only noticed it today.  My arm is not sore, the pink spot is slightly raised and not warm to the touch.  It doesn&#39;t concern me at all, however, I received a text from HD asking if I had any side effects, so I decided to respond.

I had to consciously engage muscles to gulp or get more liquid to get it down.   The problem is improved now at day 15.

Upon looking at it, I seem to have a rash about size of a half dollar where the injection was. It is red and extremely itchy. I have put some cortisone cream on the area. Upon searching the internet, I discovered it looks the rashes that have developed with Moderna but no mention of Pfizer so I thought I&#39;d let you know.

                                                I had some of the listed side effects. i.e., pain and redness at injection site and fatigue. However, by Feb 21  noticed swelling under my armpit on the left side as well as somewhat swollen nodes in the left side of my neck. The swelling under my arm became worse over the next two days. When I raised my left arm I felt considerable pain. Over the next 2 days I also had swelling in my left forearm near bend in my elbow. I also had a rash the size of a patch above the injection site.  I looked this issue up online and found reports that approximately 16% of women who had received the 2nd Covid shot experienced swelling under the armpit. I contacted my doctor by e mail .  I switched from taking tylelnol to advil.  All side effects are gone except there is still a little swelling in armpit.  I contacted my Doctor and will see her on March 15th if the swelling is not gone.

The patient also took Prolia shots for arthritis. The patient experienced headache, nausea, pain at injection site and hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold on 16Mar2021, passed out, weakness and disorientation when walking on 17Mar2021, a little tired on 18Mar2021. The clinical course included: The patient was calling about the second vaccine that she got on 16Mar2021 (Tuesday). She was calling about the after effects. They were quite huge. She had a headache, nausea, weakness, and disorientation when walking. Stated she obviously had pain at the site of injection. Stated some of it was her own fault, and at first she felt fine. On the same day that she got her second dose of the covid vaccine, she had a glass of wine and was not too hungry. She ate a little that evening. The next morning she passed out. Clarified that she had two glasses of wine, not one. Caller&#39;s daughter was a doctor. Caller referd to her daughter as doctor daughter. Stated that she told her daughter about what happened. Her daughter told her it was because she was dehydrated. Her daughter told her that it was called vagus something or another. Her daughter was not there with the caller. Her daughter called it vagus something, she does not remember. Her daughter told her that it had to do with inflammation and her immune system. Caller stated she also has arthritis. Her daughter told her that she was stupid for drinking wine after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine and not eating a full meal. Whenever she passed out and fell, she did not hurt herself but it was a wake up call. She realized she was vulnerable. She was calling because she did not know why no one told her to drink a lot of water after receiving the vaccine. She got a Prolia shot in July and the nurses told her to drink a lot of water. She was asking why the nurses who gave her the covid vaccine are not saying that to people. Her daughter told her to call the doctors office about this, and she told her daughter that it was over with now, she&#39;s 95%, she was a little tired on 18Mar2021. She was unconscious for 15 seconds per her husband. Her husband was shouting her name, and she did not hear anything. She wanted to call and report that the nurses should tell people to drink water. One more thing, her daughter told her that the covid vaccine was slowly released. About 10 hours after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold. She got the vaccine about 10AM, and about 10PM at night is whenever her hand got cold. She had pain at the injection site where she had the first dose of the vaccine too. She had more pain at injection site after the second dose of the vaccine. It was not awful, but only if she pressed on it. Clarified that she gets Prolia shots twice a year for her arthritis. Luckily whenever she started to get dizzy, she braced her self, whenever she fell, she did not fall from an upright position. She was crouched over, and fell against trays that fell with her. Her doctor daughter told her that inflammation was because of her immune system. One other thing was that she has been stung in the past and had extreme reactions from yellow jackets in the 90&#39;s. She thought her immune system was sensitive. One other things related to her autoimmune from 3 years ago. She moved to a city in 2012. Everyone told her after 5 years she would develop allergies. In 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms. It was not just like a topical thing where she scratched and itched, it was under her skin. She went to a dermatologist and he took a biopsy, but the results just said eczema. She went to an allergist, he finally found a space on her underarms where he could do a test. The test showed that she had mild allergies to mold and juniper. Juniper is a tree that they have there, she has one in her back yard. Her allergy was very mild. She tried everything, and in 4 months it went away. Now she just latherers her skin with coconut oil. Her diagnosis that this autoimmune issue was related her immune response from the yellow jacket reaction is a self diagnosis. A doctor had never told her this, this was coming from her own self. Clarified that she is calling about the second dose of the pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Headache: It was not a bad headache, it was more like pressure all across the top. Whenever she went to sleep, the headache started. She got the second dose of the covid vaccine on 16Mar2021. She had a little bit of a headache this morning. A cup of coffee with milk made it better. Nausea: It started whenever she did not want to eat dinner. She could tell her stomach was not right. The nausea and headache started together about 12 hours after her vaccine at 10:00 PM. Weakness: She noticed weakness on the next day whenever she got up to use the bathroom. Clarified as the early morning of 17Mar2021. Her weakness was about 90 percent resolved. Disorientation when walking: Clarified that her disorientation was in reference to walking only right before she fell. She was not mentally disoriented. Mentally she knew that she was not doing well. Second dose: pain at injection site: The pain only lasted for about 2-3 hours. It was now absolutely minimal. She would have to press on it to feel anything. Her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold: She got the second dose of the covid vaccine around 10:00 AM, and noticed her hand was cold about 5:00 PM., about 7-8 hours later. Whenever she went to bed, she was cold. She thought that it resolved by the next morning. The morning after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine, she passed out: She passed out about 8:15 AM. The outcome of the events headache, nausea, weakness, pain at injection site was recovering.

I was anxious as I have anxiety disorder! But my face was RED and TIRED looking. I asked staff what wrong. No swelling at that time! 4:40 PM.  That nite, my heart started POUNDING HARD all night, not stop. Ativan not help. I slept, weird dreams, wake up and still heart pounding.  8 am --- got up and hands, arms, extremities SWOLLEN!! Heart still pounding,  Felt like allergic to MSG or nitrates or preservatives or too much salt. Felt weird.. Not faint-- just weird. Tired from the pounding heart. Not fatigued.  I did have sore arm, but it was NOT an issue.  My hands, toes were red.

                                                About 1pm after receiving the vaccine I broke out in hives 2 on my left arm, around 3pm in hives one on my face, about 4pm I got 2 hives on neck. The next day I broke in 2 hives one on each leg. Then I broke out 2 (hives) on wrist. Today 01/26/2021 2 more hives one of wrist and one on the back on my hand. They start out little red circles about the size of a dime, then grow to the size of quarter or dollar.  On 01/21/2021 I went to the ER (Virtual Hospital). They looked at the hives, and told me it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave me Benadryl. They also gave me the number to VAERS to make a report.

Last night and maybe yesterday it broke out into rash around her stomach and her back below the waist no actually above the waist. She was just trying to figure out if it is from the vaccination or if she should go to dermatologist. Patient stated she did see where it can cause rashes. In fact, it did not cause all over your body but since this is one specific area. She thought maybe it was something known and they could tell her what she need to do. Possibly the 15th or 16th.  She knew she had it on 16th but she may got a little bit of. It started on 15Jan2021.  Patient stated she had not done anything for the rashes. She didn&#39;t know what to do.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Noticed my left arm was sore at the injection site and now my arm is red and a bit swollen from my shoulder to my elbow, plus a little itchy but no rash.  Was taking Tylenol and icing it until my friend told me not to ice it.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Feb2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 75-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included reverse total shoulder replacement on 26Jan2021, cardiomyopathy from an unknown date, and type 2 diabetes mellitus from an unknown date.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received her shingles shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and flu shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both in Oct2020 for immunization and had no reactions.  On 05Feb2021 at 16:00, the patient experienced hives and itching. On 05Feb2020, the patient had blotches, blistering, swollen hands, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands. The clinical course was as follows: She had absolutely no problem at the time of the injection, no soreness with it she was fine and then she had welts starting with 2-3 then all over her body, that were itching terribly. They stared on the left wrist, both hands. The patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL); but it did not help. The patient then went to the emergency room (ER). By the time she got to the ER, the hives moved up to her abdomen and she was covered in big blistery looking raisings and few small raises on her trunk and arms. The hives were concentrated from her fingers to her elbow, and then there were other blotches on her elbows to her fingers that were real concentrated. She stayed at the hospital for 3 hours, but she was not admitted. At the ER, she received pantoprazole (PROTONIX), diphenhydramine hydrochloride, hydroxyzine (ATARAX) and prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient also stated that her hands were so swollen after getting the dose of the vaccine that she couldn&#39;t get them closed and she had cracking creases with serous fluid coming out of both hands. The swelling went down a little bit the next day; but she still had the blotches. She said the itch was tolerated. However, the blistering started again. Her doctor put her on a sliding scale of prednisone and diphenhydramine at 25 mg every 6 hours. The clinical outcome of the swelling hands was recovering; while that of the blotches and blisters were not recovered. The clinical outcomes of the hives, itching, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands were unknown. The patient assessed the events to be medically significant as she had never experienced anything like this.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At 9:30 A.M. on 2/23, I noticed that I had a slight headache.  My left arm was, as I had expected, painful and red near the injection site.  As the day progressed, I became aware of more reactions: chills, body aches, increasing headache, arm pain, and changes in my temperature (I usually have a temperature of 97.6, but measured 96.6 and in the evening, 100.4).   I felt listless and nauseous by dinnertime.   By the morning of 2/24, nothing was improved, so I took 2 Tylenol, which I repeated 7 hours later and 7 hours after that.  By the morning of 2/25, I began feeling better and stopped the Tylenol.  My symptoms gradually continued to improve through 2/28.

I noticed about 4 days later (Jan2021) like I started feeling you know flu like symptoms but they were mild, if I took two an Extra strength Tylenol it went away. You know what I mean. So that one for about may be one, two may three days and that was it. I was very lethargic. The only thing I did notice that on both my legs from the ankles of about midways I have you know my leg, the lower part of my leg, I have little bit rash, a redness. It does not itch, it was not hard to the touch. My body temperature was normal. It was little red or pinkish to a little bit of red. Now, I noticed tonight that I have few spots on my right forearm. Like I said we have shot on 22nd, everything was fine, no immediate reaction or anything else and everything is okay. I just you know I feel fine but is this normal?&#34; The patient stated, &#34;No, they are healthy and safe about 20-25 minutes. Everything was fine and then let us go and I said couple of days later it hasn&#39;t progressed, it is very, it is on both of my lower legs from ankles midway up my legs and I noticed couple of spots on my left forearm but it hasn&#39;t gotten any worst and it hasn&#39;t gotten spread on any place other than right forearm.&#34; The patient also stated, &#34;You mean the rash or any other the symptoms.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248, NDC/UPC number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 12Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine facility type was reported as the &#34;doctor&#39;s office/urgent care.&#34; Relevant medical history included high blood pressure, but it was controlled blood pressure/hypertension; asthma, for which she was not taking medication at the time of the report, because it was under control; non allergic rhinitis; pre diabetes; and a little overweight. The patient further stated that she had just general medical history, which she had everything under control. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and metformin. The patient previously took to iodine, doxycycline, erythromycin, and azithromycin, for which the patient had known allergies to all of it. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID-19 prior vaccination. She was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient stated that on 12Jan2021 at 10:30, she had adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine; she had severe allergic reaction within about 30 minutes and then they call the paramedic she ended up and they gave her a shot, which she did not know if it was prednisone. It was further reported that she took her inhaler too as they said she was wheezing, which she didn&#39;t really feel in her lungs. The patient just felt that what happen was she went to the car as they said to wait 15 minutes as written, and she always follow the rules and the whole thing they said, she waited 30 minutes, so she went down side of her car then she figured that she could just drive off drive home. So, she was in car sitting or waiting for the last 30 minutes and all of a sudden she felt right through her chest like through her right side kind of going into her left; it was weird like she could feel going into her body, then suddenly her heart start beating really fast, and then she pulled down the vizor and looked in the rearview mirror and her face was all red, so she go back to the site. That&#39;s how she transpired and then, that&#39;s how the reaction was. It was further reported that the patient waited 15 minutes in the office, then went to car to wait additional 15 minutes, and suddenly felt strange sensation in her chest and her heart started beating very rapidly. She pulled down the visor in car and saw her face growing red and swelling slightly and her breathing was becoming labored. She had read on side effects on information she was given on departure stating symptoms of an allergic reaction. She returned to the facility at which time she was treated. The adverse events (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had no investigation assessment. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included that the patient was given a shot of 125 mg of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL), but another report said they gave her prednisone so they were kind of conflicting in the report, but it was a shot, and also cetirizine (ZYRTEC) and famotidine (PEPCID), and her inhaler for wheezing. The patient recovered from all the events on an unspecified date.

The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

Medical history included hear disorder, sulfa allergy, allergic to iodine, being shrinking she was 5&#39;4&#34; the last time she looked at it but she has shrunk, she was not sure but she thought she was currently shorter than 5&#39;4&#34;. The patient would like to know if it has sulfa and iodine in BNT162B2. Concomitant medications included insulin, blood pressure medication and heart medication. The patient received first dose of vaccine and experienced a rash and itching on 02Feb2021. The patient was broke out, she had a rash since she had the shot, it was like there were ants all over her back, head, legs, under her breast and under her arms in between legs. The doctor gave her Hydroxyzine for the itch and she just wanted to know, she was leery of going to get the second dose, she wanted to know was the second dose going to make it worse. The patient was scheduled to go for the second one 22Feb2021. She said the first day she got it she was fine, there was nothing, she was waiting for something to happen then she started with the rash. She was taking her blood pressure medication and insulin but she noticed that on the inside of her, on the top of the head was itching, it was the next day, and then toward the evening under her arms were itching and then between her legs and ankles and it was her right arm that she got the shot in and it started blotching. She showed it to the nurse at the office and she told the nurse maybe she was getting Ebola. She had blotches on her arm, it was only the arm she got the shot in. She still had the blotches she still had quite a few. She can still see them but they were getting lighter. Under her breast was still bugging her. She confirmed the itching and rash began the next day, after the first vaccine dose. It had improved since her doctor gave the pills to stop the itching. She was able to sleep, before she couldn&#39;t sleep she had to get up and take showers but since he had given the medicine it was improved and she had used salve, it was Cortisone but her under the bra it still itched where it was pressuring. She was going to have a labs taken to see if there was anything different. She took insulin and heart medication since forever and she even stopped to see, she said it was probably a bad thing but she stopped taking her heart medication to see if it was interacting, she stopped taking her insulin and her heart rate went up, everything was still the same, now she went back and started taking the insulin and heart medication again. Outcome of the event maybe she is getting Ebola was unknown, of the other events was recovering.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 75-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 (age at the time of vaccination was 75-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, osteoporosis and overactive bladder. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The previously had first dose (first shot) of BNT162B2 for covid-19 immunisation and had sore arm. It was reported that she is getting red bumps today (on 07Feb2021) on the part where she got injected. The consumer stated after second shot also, I had no symptoms except for sore arm on an unspecified date in Feb2021. The only thing that I noticed which was from second shot and which was really crazy is, once in a while I get this pain in my pointer finger in my right hand and that was it, it comes and it goes. But today, and in the last couple of days I noticed a little weakness in my right leg, but today when I went to work somebody said what is that big red bump on your forehead and I looked and there was a big red circle, there was a bump, like a real bump on my forehead. I didn&#39;t hide it, I didn&#39;t even think if it was allergic as I only had a banana before I went to work and a cup of coffee which I have lot of time. I am wondering if this bump that I have on my forehead which looks ridiculous and it is a big red bump, like a tumor bump, it feels like kind of sore when I touch it, is from the vaccine because I haven&#39;t had anything but the vaccine.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Main thing I am concerned about is the big red bump on my forehead.&#34; Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;I never had that before, it is very slight. The main thing was the bump on my head that came today and I didn&#39;t have it when I left the house. I didn&#39;t hit my head or anything. I just took two Tylenol and an allergy pill in case if it was some kind of allergy.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                cellulitis; Bacterial skin infection; right arm where I got the injection turning all red and swollen; arm swelling; bursitis; Muscle pain; joint pain in elbow; the bruise have been flamed; Feeling hot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6207) at the age of 75-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetic type 2 for probably 13-14 years, sleep apnea for 20 years (2001), arthritis in 2005 (probably 12-14 years), and blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure). Concomitant medications included metformin, sertraline, alprazolam, sitagliptin (JANUVIA), oxybutynin, insulin glargine (LANTUS), lisinopril for blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure), and cortisone for arthritis. The patient received the vaccine on 13Mar2021 in the afternoon and within 24 to 30 hours, the next day (14Mar2021), her right arm, where the vaccine was administered turned all red and swollen and her elbow also hurt. She went to the emergency room because she felt it was a reaction to the vaccine. They told her that it was a bacterial skin infection, an adverse effect of an initial encounter to the vaccine, arm swelling and bursitis caused by that, muscle pain and join pain in elbow and then she guessed it was like cellulitis. They gave her ROCEPHIN at the emergency room and then a couple days later, it wasn&#39;t getting any better and it was all the way down to her wrist. She went to immediate care center and received an antibiotic. She was also given 2 more prescription of antibiotics and told that it had to be administered with the antibiotics to get rid of the reactions. It has finally pretty much cleared up with the antibiotics if they hadn&#39;t put her in an immediate care and put her on intravenous medications. They were really concerned because it was going to get into sepsis or something. At first, the patient thought that it was just inflamed, then it was skin infection and then adverse effect from the initial encounter of the vaccine. She had been on the antibiotics for 10 days when it finally cleared, but the elbow was still sore and it hurts a lot, but the fluid was drained by an orthopedic doctor. She was given 2 different types of antibiotics plus a shot into her buttocks. It&#39;s a little sore because she was informed that &#34;the bruise have been flamed&#34; on Mar2021. When she went to emergency, first they give her 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched antibiotic to DURICEF and to BACTRIM DS, and advised to continue monitoring and if swelling and redness was progressive or worse, then go to emergency room again. She went to emergency room on 16Mar2021, the medicine given was doxycycline and then she was seen by an orthopedic physician today where the fluid was drained from her elbow but swelling and redness was progressively getting worst and she was feeling hot on Mar2021. So, she went to the immediate care. Overall, consistent to cellulitis of right upper arm strongly includes to go to the ER but the patient had something else and had to go right then. And then, she was given 1 gm ROCEPHIN and then switched to DURACEF and BACTRIM. She came back to the ER on the same day. It was kind of 2 things, like the redness and skin infection which currently was cellulitis. Doxycycline was what they told her to get, that&#39;s what they gave her at the emergency room, doxycycline hyclate. And then said to follow-up with her primary care which she did and that was on 17Mar2021. She looked at it and then they told her to see an orthopedic surgeon and she saw him on the 18Mar2021. They just thought that the antibiotics, that&#39;s why he gave her 2 different prescriptions plus the shot in the buttocks because he said if this will not be cured with the antibiotics, she&#39;ll end up in a hospital. And then it was raft and it took her 10 days to recover. And he marked little black dots to show where wasn&#39;t and if it goes beyond that then call us because it was spreading. The outcome of the events bruise and feeling hot was unknown, not recovered for joint pain, and recovered on 24Mar2021 for all other events. The events required emergency room visit/ physician office visit.
