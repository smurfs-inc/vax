                                                No symptoms or pain with initial injection.  I came home about 2 hours after the injection and took one 200mg ibuprofen and one 500mg acetaminophen and put an ice pack on the site briefly.  Later that afternoon I developed pain at the injection site that progressively got worse over the course of the evening so bad that I could not raise my left arm of touch the site.  I put an ice pack on again and that night I slept with a heating pad on.  I would rate the pain 8/10.  When I woke the next day the pain was still there, but not as severe.  I got in the shower and let the hot water beat on the injection site and that seems to help a lot.  The pain gradually lessened over the course of the day to a 2/10.  By the following day (3rd day post injection) the pain had completely subsided.  There was no redness or swelling at the site and I did not have any other symptoms other than the intense injection site pain.

This 60-year-old female nurse (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 to 23Dec2020 at 0.3 mL single on left deltoid to prevent getting the COVID vaccine, for protection. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed in her mid twenties, in the 80s, she had asthma when she was a child, then it stopped and resurfaced in her mid twenties, ongoing eczema diagnosed years already, a long time ago and unspecified allergies with medications.  There were no concomitant medications. She received the vaccine on 23Dec2020. She has a lot of allergies in Dec2020, and had some side effects, and she got through it ok. Her side effects were some swelling of arm, a rash developed, like 5cm x 4cm at site of injection, chills and shivers, and a bronchospasm cough on 24Dec2020. Arm swelling event started 24 hours later, no more, it was stable for 24 hours, and the 3rd day, went down, was a little raised, the next day was flat but still red. She had recovered completely. The 4th day was a good day. The patient stated she had some allergy shots she had to go through before, this was no different. Rash was no more, it was gone by 27Dec2020. She was still able to go to work. Chills and shivers started 24 hours later, and took for 48 hours intermittently, she had since recovered completely. The patient stated this was all nothing different than getting like the flu shot. Bronchospasm cough event only took another 48 hours, the difference was, even when she calls it bronchospasm, it was close to when she had an asthma attack, but no chest tightness, shortness of breath, she just would cough, spasm in Dec2020 and stop. She had recovered completely. The patient stated she had no symptoms at all before the vaccine, she was healthy, she made sure nothing was going on, that she was not tired, had no cold, she took no medications for this, as she wanted to know how her body reacted and if it can handle it. They says it was ok to take paracetamol (TYLENOL), but she did not, but the second dose she would, now that she knows and she was comfortable through it. She did have some mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores that came up in Dec2020, but nothing to run to the hospital to the doctor for. Clarifies this occured after she received the vaccine. The outcome of the event allergies, mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores were unknown. The outcome of rash at site of injection was recovered on 27Dec2020. The outcome of other events was recovered in Dec2020. The causality between Pfizer COVID vaccine with some swelling of arm, rash developed 5cm x 4cm at injection site, chills and shivers, bronchospasm cough was related (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection).

A 60-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration (Deltoid Right) from 26Dec2020 15:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic pain and insomnia. Concomitant medications included hydrocodone and temazepam. The patient reported, &#34;On 26Dec2020 I got my first immunization for COVID and today (30Dec2020) I woke up and the back of my hand was swollen and itchy on the same arm where the injection was&#34;. The patient further stated &#34;It never have happened before I don&#39;t have any reaction at the injection site but it was kind of odd that it kind of showed up on the back of my hand, it feels like an allergy kind of thing.&#34; The patient tried the Voltaren Gel to try and get the inflammation down, but it didn&#39;t help, and she took some Benadryl it doesn&#39;t seem to help much. The patient&#39;s next shot is due on &#34;12Jan2021&#34;. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                At 4hrs post vaccination experienced extreme muscular pain between shoulder blades. The following week, as far as I can recall, I began to have tingling from the right shoulder blade down to my hand. I thought I may have a pinched nerve and went to the walk in clinic to be seen by the nurse practitioner that is in the same office as my primary. She examined me and thought it sounded like a pinched nerve and said I was swollen in the area of complaint. Cervical and thoracic x rays were taken (normal) and was told to take Flexeril and steroids. Pain was getting worse and primary told me to  begin taking  Meloxicam and have physical therapy. I have been doing both beginning 1-11-2021. Pain continues with no  improvement. Do not know if my symptoms are caused from the Covid shot, but just seemed to me that it was quite a coincidence that muscle pain began on the same day as receiving the shot.

A 60-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) via unspecified route on left upper arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 05Jan2021, 12:30pm at 60-year-old. Medical history included: ongoing diabetes type 2; ongoing gout; went through menopause 10 years ago (2011). She had pulmonary emboli 3 years ago (2018) and had some scar tissue but not on oxygen though she did get short of breath. No relevant family medical history. The only reactions she has ever had was 15 years ago (2006), she had a CAT scan and experienced hives the next day due to the contrast medium. She thought it had since been changed as she had had it twice since then and was given diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) but experienced nothing again. Concomitant medication included: ongoing dulaglutide (TRULICITY) for diabetes type 2 and ongoing oral medication (unspecified) for gout. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1685) single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 19Dec2020 around 12pm and 2 pm. The patient previously got the flu shot (unspecified) every year, 3 years ago (in 2018) she got the shingles vaccine and had also had the pneumonia vaccine (in 2018) but never experienced anything from those products. The patient previously took allopurinol for pulmonary emboli and had had no reoccurrence. She took warfarin for short of breath. The patient had flushing on 05Jan2021, she was hot and turned red like a cherry. She had an episode where she felt really hot like hot flashes or almost like she was flushed. Her face was red as beet and her arm and hands were red, this lasted about an hour and she took ibuprofen (ADVIL) for it. It seemed to be resolved but had come and gone through the night. She was up checking on her puppies so that was how she noticed. She had taken her temperature and it had been 97.6-98.1 which was normal for her, but she was still getting the hot flashes and flushing. She felt feverish and it was not a rash, she just felt flushed. After the vaccine, the patient reported soreness in the arm on 05Jan2021. The patient was experiencing tingling in hands and feet (mostly in feet) on 05Jan2021 and they feel cold. Tingling started about 45 minutes to an hour after the dose. The first time lasted 3-4 hours and then went away. It came back in the middle of the night for a couple hours and then again this morning. This morning it had been going on for 2-3 hours and was still going on right now; it started about 6:30am-7am. They feel cold but her feet were really cold. She had socks and slippers on, but they didn&#39;t seem to get warm. She went on to explain that her hands and feet have profusion. During this she had checked her pulse ox (oximetry) related to her cold hands and it had been 92-95% (on unknown date) which was good. She had also checked her pedal pulses even though they were cold, and a little they were a little on white side, they blanch although might be a little slow but nothing alarming. The patient had a little headache on 05Jan2021. Other than that, the patient felt fine. No emergency room or physician office visited. No relevant tests. Action taken for BNT162B2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events flushing, hot/ felt really hot, soreness in the arm, tingling in hands and feet (mostly in feet) and they feel cold was not resolved; outcome of the other events was unknown. Causality assessment between the Pfizer product (BNT162B2) and the events (tingling, flushing, soreness in the arm) per the reporter was reported as related.

A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on the arm left on 05Jan2021 around 12:00 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient used to get legs cramps when she was pregnant with her twins, but it was only one leg. The patient stated she delivered six children, was in car accidents, and had surgeries. And the patient stated the pain from the COVID-19 Vaccine was beyond any other pain she has experienced. The patient needed glasses to read patient card. And stated her eyesight was going. The patient was pretty healthy. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. And the patient did not receive additional vaccines on same date that administered BNT162B2. The patient experienced deaf and couldn&#39;t hear on 06Jan2021 09:00, leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out on 05Jan2021 19:00, dizzy on 05Jan2021, nauseous on 05Jan2021, threw up twice on 05Jan2021, things started looking funny on 06Jan2021 09:00, pain through whole body and tremoring on 06Jan2021 10:00, bruise at injection site on Jan2021. All the events (except for event bruise at injection site) were reported as seriousness as life threatening. Clinical course: the patient worked nightshift. Laid down that afternoon to take a nap and got up around 10:00. Around 05Jan2021 19:00 PM had sever leg cramps in both legs where her toes were curled out. Leg cramps after vaccine wouldn&#39;t go away and it was in both legs. Just wouldn&#39;t go away. Around 05Jan2021 21:00 PM it went away. The patient was dizzy, nauseous, and threw up twice on the night of 05Jan2021, and going into 06Jan2021. The patient went to the couch in the hotel room and started going deaf. She couldn&#39;t hear anything on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Things started looking funny on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Woke up at 09:35. Hour after that there was pain through her whole body and everything was hurting at 10:00 AM on 06Jan2021. The patient was tremoring at 10:00 AM on 06Jan2021. Couldn&#39;t reach the phone to dial 9-11. Thought she was going to die. Last until about noon and then started to go away. Doesn&#39;t know if it is safe to take the second vaccine. Doesn&#39;t know if these are thing that should have happened to her. She started to get real concerned. Went into hotel room and started feeling dizzy again. Stopped haring things. Funny feeling in her ears. Was seeing things, got dizzy, and everything got dark. Everything lasted until 12:00 PM on 06Jan2021. Everything was good now. The patient had a bruise where injection was in Jan2021. Stated it was nothing compared to what she went through. Woke up around 10:00 AM. Then went back to sleep and got up around 18:00 PM. She felt fine. Her whole body was sore from the muscle spasming. The outcome of the event bruise at injection site was unknown, of the event leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out was recovered around 05Jan2021 21:00, the outcome of other remain events was recovered on 06Jan2021 12:00.  The reporter considered (method of assessment: Global Introspection) that all the events were related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: All the reported events were possibly related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship. However, it is worth noting that the 60-year-old female patient had car accidents history and had surgeries. All the events started when she worked nightshift, including leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out, nauseous, threw up twice, pain through whole body, tremoring and transient deafness. Patient did not get rest after vaccination may a risk factor to the onset of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears.

Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches. After the first one, it took 10 hours for the shivering to start. This time it was very similar. The shivering started about 10 hours later, at 9pm on 11Jan2021.

Nausea started at 11:00 pm on 11Jan2021 and got worse at 03:30 when she got up to go to the bathroom around midnight. She felt like she could vomit and felt better, but she couldn&#39;t. Her thighs were burning at 03:30 on 12Jan2020. It was persistent weak and burning. She can barely walk. The areas that have hurt like when you get the flu, she was having now in the same places, so she thought it was from the shot.

A contactable Nurse (patient) worked in outpatient mental health reported that a 60-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 16:20 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine administered at hospital and not military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included ongoing Graves&#39; disease (the patient had her thyroid irradiated away for Grave&#39;s disease 25 years ago). Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine 1.25 mcg once daily by mouth Graves&#39; disease taking for 25 years. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. The patient received her Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 04Jan2021. Since then she started to experience a genital itch immediately; a rash that was across her body; eyes were swollen and itchy; new itchy rash 13Jan2021. She felt okay going home then she started to have itching around the genital area. She thought she might have a yeast infection but she didn&#39;t have any other symptoms for a yeast infection. Her vulva became swollen from 05Jan2021 and itchy from 04Jan2021 and she noticed rash around her body. It all started in the genital area. The next day the rash spread down her thighs and she noticed an itchy place on her face, but you couldn&#39;t see it. Her thighs were inflamed and she noticed patches of angry whelps on her hips as well as a itchy rash area on her tailbone that seemed more like shingles; size of a quarter; raised, itchy, rash, that felt like it was radiating out. Then she noticed the rash on her face on her cheek, general swelling on her eyes and itching on her eye lids. Now the genital itching was less and most of her symptoms were improved but her eye was driving her crazy and it was more swollen on the outside. She tried to treat her eyes with eye drops Dry Eye Relief (manufacturer Similasan; no UPC seen, lot number: 15942; expiration date: Sep2022, ingredients include Belladonna) but it didn&#39;t help. They were still itchy and weepy. The eye drops were not working. She also treated the rash and itching with Benadryl at night and it improved the symptoms overall. She took Tylenol (UPC 300043760; lot number: PMA003; expiration date: Aug2022) and Bayer Aspirin (81mg; lot number: NAA93E1; expiration date: Feb2023. No UPC code on bottle) every day for general arthritis symptoms, but they didn&#39;t touch her dull headache she has had on and off since the vaccine. Before she got the vaccine, she had a little tag on her vulva, it was tiny. Now after experiencing the itching, swelling, rash on her vulva, the tag was gone. It just took a layer of skin right off. It was not uncomfortable but the whole layer of the skin was gone. It was very uncomfortable while it was happening but now it was okay. When she noticed these symptoms, she tried to call occupational health and a institute but didn&#39;t get anyone. She also contacted her HCP but had not heard back. It seemed to her like a lot of side effects and a lot of itching. She didn&#39;t have it in her throat, but all that itching seems a lot like an anaphylactic reaction. She was curious whether we would recommend her to take the second dose since they say the reaction to the second dose was worse. She had multiple COVID tests that have all come back negative. A friend tested positive so she had a test; and she had a test when she traveled. The events did not require a visit to physician or emergency room. The patient had reactions: itching, rash, swelling, welts, shingle like rash on tailbone, genital area, hips moving to her face, itching and inflammation, in eyes as well. She wanted to know if the 2nd dose was recommended. It was &#34;like an anaphylactic reaction but not in her throat.&#34; itching around the genital area, vulva started from 04Jan2021, vulva was swollen started from 05Jan2021; Rash vulva started from 06Jan2021 to 10Jan2021; rash down her thighs started from 07Jan2021; Raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles started from 06Jan2021, whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy from 07Jan2021; itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see started from 06Jan2021; raised itchy area on her left cheek and eyes started from 07Jan2021; Headache dull started from 06Jan2021. The events Headache dull, itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see; whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy and raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles were reported as non-serious by the reporter and other events were considered as medical significant by the reporter. Investigation assessment for the events was reported as No. The outcome of the event anaphylactic reaction, inflammation in eye, welts was unknown, outcome of the event Rash vulva was recovered on 10Jan2021; of Headache dull, swelling eye was not recovered, of other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Upon waking around midnight, I had developed a 102.4 degree (F) fever, total body ache, headache, chills, and cough. Most symptoms lasted approximately 24 hours.

The &#34;rash&#34; measures approximately 4.5 cm x 7 cm.

A 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes from about 3-4 years before, and an allergic reaction to the dye when testing heart - couldn&#39;t remember the dye put in. She was allergic to that and sent to the ER because her throat was starting to close up about 3 years before. Concomitant medications were none. Patient received the Covid vaccine and developed rash on 24Dec2020 that was worsening and she asked if there was any recommendation on whether this was it going to get worse. Patient received the vaccine and was very worried because she was really itchy in back and her legs were all rash and in her back. She was starting to itch really bad. This was after 2 days of the vaccine (on 24Dec2020). She didn&#39;t take note until it came to her back and her friend checked her back and told her there was a rash. She asked if this could be related to the vaccine. She asked was this a severe reaction and should she receive the next dose. Her second dose was scheduled for 08Jan2021. She did not know at this time if she would get the second dose as scheduled or not. Onset of rashes started on her legs; she thought it would go away; but the rashes had worsened; they were now on her back and were getting really itchy; she had a friend look at it who told her she had patches of rashes on her back. She reported that she was going to contact her doctor about this information because she was scared about the rashes. Outcome of the events was not resolved.  Lot/Batch and Expiration date has been requested.

A contactable other HCP (Patient) reported for a 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (lot: EK92331), intramuscular at left arm on 04Jan2021 (approximately between 18:15-18:30) at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included supplements. The patient experienced soreness and swelling at injection site, malaise and feels tired on 05Jan2021 08:00. She was scheduled for second dose a day later for COVID vaccine so after the 21 days to get her second dose. Patient is a Dental Hygienist. She received the first dose on 04Jan2021 and is scheduled to receive second dose on 26Jan2021. She should have it scheduled for 25Jan2021. There is no prescriber. She received it at a local hospital through her employer. They did not offer her the 25Jan2020, and said next day is 26 days. They told her there would not be any problem being a day late. She called back with a concern and had evening appointment with the intention of being 3 weeks later. She did it while she had 2 days off work in case she had a reaction. She was told it was not a big deal to get it 1 days later. She asked if she could go to a different location and they told her no, it had to come from the same batch and lot to receive second dose. She is just concerned about doing it a day before she has to go back to work because there are worse side effects with second dose. There is a 4 day grace period from what she read of of 17-21 days and not over 21 days. She is not sure if that is true though. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

The patient&#39;s medical history was covid at the end of Apr/May2020 with shortness of breath, seasonal allergies and allergies to &#34;some anitbiotics.&#34; The concomitant medications was reported as none, received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced soreness at site, redness and swelling, fever, nausea, general feeling of unwell 3 days. Patient stated, &#34;I had covid at the end of April/May with shortness of breath. I thought I would have less reaction from the vaccine. I know someone who was out of work for a while week after the vaccine.&#34; States that she read that the 2nd dose is supposed to have worse side effects than the first. If she had bad side effects from the 1st dose, will the 2nd be worse? Also asking if the side effects are the immune system reacting or just an allergic reaction. Patient was anxious about getting her second COVID shot on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that she had all the side effects listed, for three days. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t mind the side effects at the time, she had fever, soreness at the injection site, nausea, and a general feeling of unwell, but Patient stated that she could not work like that. Patient stated that her question was, statistically she has read that the side effects from the second shot are supposed to be worse than the first shot, but she was wondering, if she had bad side effects from the first shot, will her side effects be worse after the second, or will they maybe be lessened because she already had bad side effects. Patient reported that she did fill out the VSafe significant because she had to work on the third day after her shot, which was Christmas Eve, and work, was so busy and she did not feel well. Patient stated that she does have two days scheduled off work after her next injection, but it is the third day that she was worried about because she does not want to work feeling like that. Patient stated that the arm soreness started that same day (21Dec2020). At first, Patient reported that the arm soreness resolved, but then she states that it is still a little sore to the touch. So Patient confirmed that it is ongoing but improved. Patient reportsed that the fever started the day after the injection, 22Dec2020 and it has resolved. Patient reported that the last day she recorded a fever was on 24Dec2020. Patient  stated that she woke up on 24Dec2020 and her temperature was normal, so she went to work and she did not feel so well at work, but they were so busy that she barely noticed, and then when the Patient  went home that night, she took her temperature and it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient reported that the nausea started on 22Dec2020, which was mild at times, but then she got to where she did not want to eat.

I fell forward and sustained bruising to my right cheek and temple.  I will be reporting another report regarding the second dose with adverse reaction that is the same but required EMS and Emergency Room visit. Approximately 3 hours after injection I was getting ready for bed (as I work nights). I was talking with my daughter and I stood up and remember waking up on the floor. Bruising to the right cheek and temple. I did not seek medical attention and went to bed. I had no further episode but remained dizzy for several days.

Unusual taste in mouth (that happened after 1st dose as well). Small wave of nausea. Sensation of heat in chest. At 1301 on 1/20/2021, 50 mg of IM Benadryl administered to RD (Lot # 080010, Exp 8/20/2022) by NP. At 1320, arms were less flushed, however b/l pins and needles persistent in both arms and feet, with &#34;tingling&#34; still in lips. Pt will wait until symptoms improve further to d/c to home. NP checking in continuously.

                                                Due to hx of allergic reactions, pt was told to wait for 30 minutes in observation prior to vaccination. At 1208 on 1/20/2021 pt received 2nd dose of COVID Pfizer vaccine. Immediately after vaccination, pt experienced unusual taste in mouth, flushing, and feeling of heat in chest.  At 1232, pt noticed flushing on arms and feelings of heat and pins and needles in both arms, hands, chest, both feet, and back. Sensation was persistent, so at 1301, 50 mg of IM Benadryl administered to RD by NP. By 1320 flushing on arms and chest subsided, feeling of pins and needles persisted but was not as severe as initial reaction. By 1345 flushing on arms returned, pins and needles sensation worsened again in all locations noted prior, spread to scalp, and tingling sensation occurred on lips. Pt communicated with Dr advised to stay under observation, but transfer to ED not medically necessary. At 1415, pt was advised to go home with supervision of partner and monitor symptoms from there.

                                                I had an immediate reaction to the covid vaccine within 30 seconds after the injection.  I felt a warm sensation after the vaccine in my deltoid muscle then felt it go up both my ears, around my head.  I then felt the same warm sensation in my abdomen, followed by buzzing of my entire body with light headedness.  I could breath, I could talk, but I had an urgency for others around me to know that I wasn?t feeling well and something was not right.  I asked my colleagues if someone could take me to the ER for monitoring.  They immediately put me in a recliner and elevated my legs.  This did not relieve my symptoms and asked to go to the ER.  I got to the ER and laid on the stretcher with continued increased buzzing sensation especially in my finger tips and arms.  My vital signs were 148/88 and HR 88 (elevated from my normal of 100-120/60-70, HR 60s).  The buzzing turned into a sensation in my arms that rumbled erratically.  I thought something bad was about to happen and that my blood cells would burst. Then I also felt icy cold in my arms and my gut.  Next what happened were teeth chattering shivers.  All these symptoms occurred in a matter of minutes.  They started an IV, drew blood, gave me Benadryl and ran IV fluids.  My vitals did not reflect what I felt inside, but as symptoms let up, my VS returned to normal.  As quickly as the symptoms started, they eventually calmed down and I was able to leave the ER in 1.5 hours to go home. I was very scared.  The ER doctor thought I had a hyperimmune response to the vaccine.

                                                Slightly sore left deltoid, cleared up in a few days.  16 hours after shot, experienced the dramatic sensation of tilting while sitting on a couch.  Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

I rested, slept and hydrated the remainder of the day. Did not go to work today.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3302, NDC number/expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm (also reported as upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; the patient was a healthcare worker and was trying to protect herself. The vaccination facility type was reported as a drive thru site. Relevant medical history included previous neurological problems, which included history of underlying migraine with paresthesia/chronic paresthesia (ongoing) and tinnitus. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no other vaccine received on the same day of the Pfizer suspect or 4 weeks prior. She never had any problems with vaccines in the past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as none. Initially, the patient was asking if there were any reports of paresthesia, serious neurologic adverse events, tinnitus, hearing loss, or abdominal tightness in the studies for the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccine. After the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021, she experienced an exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus. She also reported experiencing some abdominal tightness on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient reported she was scheduled for her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, but had concerns because she was still experiencing tinnitus and it was &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss&#34; on an unspecified date. The patient further reported that she was due for the next dose the following day at the time of the report (03Feb2021). She had previous neurological problems and did not know if this did exacerbate things or not. She had migraines, tinnitus, and paresthesia and was wondering how many other patients with neurological problems reported this and was this a common side effect or adverse event reported. One doctor told her not to get the second dose and another one told her to get it and she wanted to know what she should do. The patient had headaches/migraines on the evening of vaccination on 13Jan2021 that were fairly mild and 3 days after that on 16Jan2021, they got bad and was accompanied with nausea with increased tinnitus. The migraines and nausea had gone, and the chronic paresthesia was the same as she always had, but the tinnitus was a lot louder and worse. The patient also mentioned that her migraines usually go away, but this one had lingered. The AEs did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. There were no investigation assessment. The patient recovered from the event &#34;nausea&#34; on an unspecified date, she was recovering from the event &#34;exacerbation of migraine/ headaches/migraines,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exacerbation of paresthesia and tinnitus/increased tinnitus, while the outcome of the events &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss and some abdominal tightness&#34; was unknown. The reporter assessed the events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; as serious, other medically important conditions. The relatedness of drug to the reactions/events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; was unknown as per the reporting pharmacist (Method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 61-year-old female had relevant medical history included previous neurological problems. The reported neurological events and partial hearing loss were more likely due to pre-existing conditions, and less likely related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  Event nausea was likely due to the first dose of bnt162b2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Persisted through night and spread down into right side of neck to left arm ache. Throat became red and right, then left side of tonsil became pus filled. Chills but no fever. Fatigue every day.  Took 2-3 hour naps every couple of days and slept 8-10 hours through the nights.  Headache off and on for 10 days.  Throat remained red, becoming most sore late afternoons, voice hoarse. On and off drippy nose.  On the 13th day I felt normal energy level in the morning but today, my 15th day at nearly 3pm, my normal energy is waning and throat becoming sore again.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Blood pressure high diagnosed a couple years ago. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) for COVID-19 immunization on 29Dec2020 and unspecified flu shot last fall, she thinks in Sep or Oct2020, but she has never had problems with those. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient called and said she had reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 12 hours after her second dose and wanted to report it. She said also this past weekend, on Sunday, on 24Jan2021, she started to develop a localized rash that has like a border to it. She added that she got her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021 at about 01:30 PM in her right arm. She said that she woke up the next morning, 20Jan2021 at 03:00 AM with a high fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and rapid heart rate. She said that the high fever that started the temperature she took was 103 initially, she says she took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and it came down to 101, and the next day it was probably 100 most of the day, then it broke that evening. She said the Tylenol, the dose was the extra strength, unknown if it was 500 mg, they were capsules. She says she normally doesn&#39;t keep it around, the in-house nurse suggested it so she went and got a sample thing and took a couple doses, she doesn&#39;t have it with her as she is at work and is not at home. She said that the nausea and vomiting subsided after the first day or second day, she had the on and off fever and slept most of the day both days. She said that she doesn&#39;t have a fever now. She said that she doesn&#39;t have her exact heart rate from when she was having the rapid heart rate, she just felt it in her chest. She added that the only reason she said anything was because she called in sick last week on an unspecified date in Jan2021. She said that the rash started developing after that and it is now probably the size of a 16 oz or 60 oz cup, unable to clarify number with caller, she said that it is definitely big but it doesn&#39;t bother her, though she is concerned it is there. She clarified that it is a couple inches in diameter and kind of looks like the state of (State Name), on her injection arm which was her right arm. She said her arm is not sore now, it was after the shot on an unspecified date in Jan2021, if she pressed where the injection was it is still a little sore. She said that the hospital said to report it. She said she also has a concern if she should she get another shot if they decide this is needed for more than two vaccinations. She said that she knows they are still gathering information at this point, so she thought she should better turn in, hopefully there will be solution later on. The outcome of the events localized rash, dizziness, heart rate increased and sickness was unknown. The outcome of the events fever, nausea and vomiting was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021 while the outcome of the event vaccination site pain is recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (, Solution for injection, Batch/lot no: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 15:00 in the left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously did get a flu shot in Nov or Dec2020. The patient developed a bad rash, hives, all over her body and itching on 10Feb2021. She reports, her feet were incredibly hot over the next 3 days on 07Feb2021. What started off as a few bumps kept increasing up to 3 days later. She was unable to sleep from being so itchy. Her doctor said it was an allergic reaction and prescribed an antihistamine after which it left in Feb2021. She was due for the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021. The patient did not had any investigation assessment. The patient states that there was little information out there to compare the experience she had. Wanted to call to make Pfizer aware of that and maybe get some more information out there. Has printed out the fact sheet and assumes she should not get the second vaccine because of what happened the first time. Wants to clarify what happened and share with Pfizer this information since she can&#39;t find much information for people who have had a delayed reaction. Went to get the vaccine on 04Feb and doesn&#39;t consider herself an allergic type person. Has no allergy to foods, medicines, only gets poison ivy and bug bites like most people. By Monday, the 4th day (08Feb2021) after getting the vaccine, noticed a couple of bumps on the wrist and does not know where else and didn&#39;t think of it as anything else. Thought it was a bite or she touched a plant and then it went away. It was not much. In the evening of Tuesday she had a bad reaction and on the 10th (10Feb2021) she had rash, hives, and itching that just moved to different places over the body. Her feet were so hot on the 3rd day and had to plunged them into cold water and used Epsom salt off and on and it helped some. This happened only for 2 nights and the reason she didn&#39;t go to the doctor, it went away. Again, mentions the first night she had a couple bumps and didn&#39;t think much about it. The second night, it was all over her body, the rash, and she took Epsom baths that helped, but she didn&#39;t get much more than an hour of sleep. She tried to take pictures of her thighs and backside, but unable to take good pictures, not a selfie person. The next morning she had her husband take pictures in case it went away and she went to the doctor they would have pictures to show. Her husband thought it may be shingles. Called the doctor on Thursday and had pictures to show her since the rash went away. Again, mentions the reaction was so bad on Wednesday. The doctor didn&#39;t believe areas on pictures of her back were shingles since shingles does not come and go away like that and that she must have had an allergic reaction to something. Provider didn&#39;t believe it was from the vaccine. Was given a prescription for Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg and was informed if areas didn&#39;t improve or returned she may need to see an allergist or immunologist. After the appointment she didn&#39;t get much sleep and woke up at 4pm in the afternoon and felt a little off, it could have been in her head or maybe she was paranoid, but she wasn&#39;t going to wait for the reaction to be full blown over her body and took one Hydroxyzine HCL and went to bed at 7:30pm and didn&#39;t do anything since. Got up and the reaction/rash, hives, itching was all gone after taking only one. It&#39;s like an antihistamine or Zyrtec. No further details provided. Later mentions after getting the first vaccine on the 4th, the next day she had arm soreness up until that Monday when the rash started. No further details provided. Says as far as recommendations were concerned for the paper she printed, the fact sheet. It says pretty much listed, she shouldn&#39;t have the second dose if difficulty breathing, swelling in the face and throat. The only thing she had was the rash on the neck, not the face. Paperwork also lists heart beating fast, or severe allergic reaction. The patient had no emergency room visit. The patient visited the physician office. The outcome of the event hot feeling in feet was recovered on feb2021 and rest of the events was recovering.

                                                starting developing hives on back of my neck and head  6 days after the covid vaccine was administered. The hives progressed to my ears, arms, abdomen, groin, and upper thighs. I started taking Benadryl the first evening the hives started and continued benadryl for 2 more days. The benadryl did not stop the progression or  help much with the intense itching.  Had a telehealth visit via the telephone with Dr on Monday Jan 4. He ordered  Atarax prn. I also started taking Pepcid and Zyrtec. Today I still have hives that are developing but at a much slower pace. The itching is much improved.      DO I TAKE THE 2ND VACCINE?

A 62-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 28Dec2020 at 14:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included environmental allergies, she has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume, blood pressure (abnormal) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn&#39;t have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn&#39;t know if it was later that day. She can&#39;t remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn&#39;t have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn&#39;t want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn&#39;t as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn&#39;t hurt as bad, but she can&#39;t remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She&#39;s been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don&#39;t give it to her anymore. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn&#39;t want to get the next one and have a worse reaction. She is not sure if she should be worried. The events of swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm were assessed as medically significant. Outcome of the event of &#39;swelling of fingers&#39; was not recovered, the other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event joint pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

                                                My body had started itching  and I didn&#39;t know why.  I had not eaten anything new or changed any shampoo or soap. Finally on Thursday night I realized maybe it is the shot that is giving me all the itching. My whole body was flushed I kept scratching my arms and legs, especially  around my ankle, knee, under arm and goin area.  I took an allergy pill  and called Kaiser and spoke with an advice nurse. she   mentioned that taking an allergy pill will relief some of the itching.   I fell asleep around after midnight normally I go to bed around 9:30.  I also called pfizer and explained and the person took all my information and symptoms.

A 62-year-old female patient started received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for an unspecified indication. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  As reported, patient asked, &#34;should I get the second injection of the COVID-19 vaccine since I have this cough that will not go away?.&#34; This female nurse, who was also the patient, reported receiving her first injection of the PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE on 18Dec2020. She started to develop a cough after the injection that did not improve and had worsened by the end of the second week. Treatment has included cetirizine (ZYRTEC), dextromethorphan (ROBITUSSIN),Guaifenesin (MUCINEX) and albuterol inhaler. A chest x-ray showed some inflammation on the lungs and she was given a steroid inhaler, which has helped. She has received two COVID-19 tests at different time intervals, and both were negative. She was scheduled to receive the second COVID-19 vaccination on Friday but was uncertain if she should receive it given her cough was not improving. She had a bad cough, and other symptoms just before her injection (pending clarification). But her general practitioner (GP) put her in a steroid inhaler. She talked to her GP but can&#39;t give her complete advice as to whether she can still take the 2nd dose or not due to her situation. She said she had very slight pain in her arms after taking the vaccine, and felt a really bad headache on 18Dec2020. She would like to know if she still needs to continue the 2nd dose of vaccine or not since she still has a cough. Patient asked if there was any guidance on getting a second dose and what if test was a false positive and she really did have COVID-19?. Outcome of the event &#34;She started to develop a cough after the injection that did not improve and had worsened by the end of the second week&#34; was  not recovered while &#34;A chest x-ray showed some inflammation on the lungs&#34;, Slight pain in her arms and Bad headache were unknown.   Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                Almost immediately after the injection, I noticed a metallic taste. It was mild enough that it did not interfere with the taste of foods or drinks. It was noticeable whenever I had not had anything by mouth for a while. This lasted for 2 to 3, maybe 4, days.  Soreness at the injection site, and stiffness of the arm, began the evening after the injection.  Warming applications and moving the arm relieved these symptoms.  They were gone the next day.

This case was also received from Pfizer sponsored program.  A 62-year-old female patient received the 2nd dose (at the age of 62-years-old) of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot# not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in Feb2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung and back problems (back pain). It was reported that the patient normally took an inhaler (not steroid inhaler because she didn&#39;t want to interfere with immune response), and other things. The patient previously took prednisone which started at 40mg for 2 days, 30 for 2 days, 20 for 2 days then goes down to zero for back pain (stopped taking 4 days before the second dose of the vaccine). The patient received the first dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE (Lot# not provided) on 29Jan2021 (at the age of 62-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s 2nd dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE was administered a week ago (Feb2021) Friday. It was reported that she got very ill initially which she said joint pain in hands and headache noted in Feb2021 (Saturday) which wasn&#39;t so bad. On Saturday afternoon, she reported shortness of breath, coughing with extreme pain (painful cough) and described a feeling of bugs crawling in her lungs, bugs front and back, and itching, and no one else reported it.

The events (joint pain in hands, headache, shortness of breath, coughing with extreme pain (painful cough) and itching) were medically significant as she was unable to go to work. It was also mentioned that since the patient stopped taking the Prednisone 4 days before the second dose of the vaccine. The patient had an exacerbation of pain (it came back). The patient was also wondering when can she start the inhaler and steroid for the back as she has lung and back problems. Outcome of the events were unknown.   Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on data provided, the reported events are assessed as possibly related to BNT162B2. This case will be reviewed upon receipt of further information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 or not prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 at 2nd injection cannot be excluded for the reported events based on the known safety profile and the plausible temporal relationship.

This 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Feb2021 at 12:00 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was unknown. Concomitant medications were none. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks or other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced fever 103 white posture on knee that turned into cellulitis and lymphadenitis. The patient had IV antibiotics twice within 5 days of vaccine as treatment for events. The patient still had swollen from groin area down to knee. AE resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had no covid prior vaccination, no covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event cellulitis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2 based on the information provided. The event onset date is not reported, therefore the drug-event temporal relationship is not clear. In addition, the BNT162B2 vaccine was administered in the arm but the reported cellulitis was at knee area. It is very unlikely that the cellulitis was related to BNT162B2.

                                                Soreness injection site; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: unspecified product and adverse event. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program. A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 23Dec2020 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Medical history included penicillin allergy and anaphylaxis to a penicillin type drug. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took ampicillin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) from an unknown date to an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced drug allergy.  On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced soreness at injection site. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The clinical outcome of the soreness at injection site was recovered in Dec2020 after about 48 hours. The reporter considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the soreness at the injection site was related to the vaccine.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                On Friday, January 15 at approximately 6 PM while seated in a reclining chair watching television I started to develop hives below my right gluteal fold. Over the next six hours  approximately 300 hives appeared on my skin. They were very itchy. At approximately midnight my lip began to swell and being a certified registered nurse anesthetist,  who lives alone, I knew it was time to head to the ER. Prior to going to the ER  I  cleaned the lesions With alcohol, took prednisone 10 mg PO,  and applied hydrocortisone cream.    In the ER, I was given Benadryl 50 mg PO and Pepcid 20 mg and observed for one hour. The hives remained but there was no respiratory compromise. Approximately six hours later the hives were still increasing in size and number, were unbearably itchy and my swollen lips had not subsided.  I took Claritin 10 mg PO and returned to the same ER and was given Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, prednisone 20 mg po and observed for three hours. The hives did not decrease and again there was no respiratory compromise so I was sent home on prednisone And a H-1 blocker.  Of note, both my palms and lips have been bright cherry red.     I finished a five day course of Macrobid on January 13 at 10 AM.    Final diagnosis:  Alergic  reaction

At approximately 3:30 pm I started having a lot of pain in my legs (calves and feet) at first it was extreme pain that led to tingly prickly sensations. I went home, went to bed, was up all night in bed groaning because of the pain, and when I tried to stand, was unable to. I crawled to my phone and called my sister (who lives next door) who ran over. She has a wheelchair and took me to the hospital.  I was unable to walk alone for four days and the pain was not as extreme after 5 days. I am now 3 weeks out and still have numbness in my legs.

She was given the vaccine in her left arm. The pt did not have any rash or hives noted.  The PA spoke with the pt and 50 mgs Benadryl was given p.o.(@ 1450).  The pt stayed to be observed and after an additional 40 minutes  (@ 1531) she said she was feeling better and was going to her unit to work (eve shift). The pt. spoke to her Nurse Manager upon arrival back to her unit and was sent home instead of working. Her unit was called at 4pm and we were informed that the pt went home, as she was concerned of being too tired to work.

                                                Vaccine was administered on 12/30 at around noon.  I felt fine that day but was aware that a previously diagnosed but inactive area of contact dermatitis on my right knee was flaring up - becoming very pruritic and active.  Over about 48 hours it became red, blistered and eventually weepy.  The area had been biopsied in September of 2020 (&#34;spongiatic dermatitis&#34;), treated with topical steroids and for the most part resolved.  I saw my dermatologist on 1/6 - repeat biopsy was done (&#34;severe allergic reaction&#34;) and it was treated again with topical steroids and is resolving.  On 1/12 I began experiencing generalized pruritus.  I have patchy erythema, dermatographism, and a few scattered solitary urticarial lesions.  There are no respiratory symptoms - specifically no shortness of breath, cough, bronchospasm, swelling of mouth, lips or tongue.  No joint pain.  No fever.   I took zyrtec 10 mg with minimal improvement.  I contacted my dermatologist today who feels this is an Id reaction and suggested reporting the reaction to VAERS.  I have also contacted my primary physician and have a telehealth visit scheduled.  The biggest question is whether to have the second dose of the vaccine, as I am a physician actively seeing sick outpatients.

This 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 06Jan2021 13:00 on left arm at single dose (Lot # EL1284) for COVID prevention. Medical history included ongoing arthritis in some form probably since 2011 (reported as ten years ago, as of 07Jan2021), ongoing Osteoporosis had it probably at least since five years ago, maybe longer, ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus had it probably since 2016 (reported as five years ago, as of 07Jan2021) High cholesterol this is managed or lowered with medication, and was diagnosed in 2001 (reported as probably 20 years ago, as  of 07Jan2021) her whole family has it.

She says that the first time she got the injection in her right arm, but the second time her right arm was still hurting, which she has arthritis over there also, this time she got the injection in her left arm. She says that the soreness or sharp pain under her left ear could be or not be related. She experienced soreness to arm injection site. She says that the area below her left ear doesn&#39;t feel swollen, it just feels like not a sore throat, but every so often she has a sharp pain, and it could be that she slept on it wrong. She says she was wondering if that goes away fast or is connected, like a possible side effect. The patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine 06Jan2020 13:00 and reported to have a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear on 07Jan2021, sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes. She read that swollen lymph nodes were a side effect and is asking if that area is a lymph node and would that be considered a side effect and is asking how long it will it take before it goes away. She is wondering since side effects said might have lymph node swelling or something. She says in her arm where her shot was given is sore, and also kind of right below her left ear, which she thinks that is where a lymph node is. She says every so often she has a sharp pain there that goes away, and she wanted to know if this could be a part of it, since she is guessing that is where a lymph node is, or wondering it this is something even related that could be a side effect. Treatment included she took Tylenol Rapid Relief Extra Strength a while ago, dose queried but not provided. EXP: Jul2022, LOT: SJA072, this is not on the bottle, it must have been on an outer box which was discarded.

A 64-years-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), intramuscular on deltoid left from 30Dec2020 to 30Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included contact dermatitis. There were no concomitant medications. The reporter stated that the patient had mentioned that she had contact dermatitis for several months now and before taking the COVID-19 vaccine, it has settled within a month. 6-12 hours after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, her contact dermatitis had worsened dramatically on 30Dec2020. She was prescribed high dose topical steroids by her doctor. She also developed generalized itching and isolated hives on 12Jan2021. She is trying to avoid systemic corticosteroids because it might affect the vaccine. She is also taking antihistamines but she said these interventions don&#39;t seem to be working. Stated that it has not responded to anything. The patient also stated stated that she has not taken steroids because her second dose is due in a week. Stated that the doctors do not think that it is due to the vaccine but due to reactivation (immune system reactivity) of something that had happened. Stated that they are treating it with high dose topical steroids, pepcid and hydroxyzine. Wanted to see if there was information on this sort of reaction and if they had guidance on the second shot. Had the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine. Outcome of the events urticaria and pruritus was not recovered while outcome of the remaining events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported generalized itching and isolated hives occurred 13 days after the first dose of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2.  Based on the reasonable temporal association, the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events and the administration of the suspect. However, the pre-existing contact dermatitis might have provided alternative explanation towards the onset of the events.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9262, expiration date was not reported) given at 64 years of age, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies. Concomitant medication included thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID), aluminium hydroxide gel, dried, magnesium carbonate (PEPCID [ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE GEL, DRIED;MAGNESIUM CARBONATE]), and metronidazole. The patient was not pregnant. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor was she tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. It was reported that less than one hour after receiving the vaccine on 25Jan2021 at 04:00 PM, the patient developed itching inside her mouth and throat, and on her hands and legs. The itching stopped with BENADRYL. Four days later on 29Jan2021 14:30, she developed swollen and blistered lips. The outcome of the events was recovering and were reported non-serious. Treatment received for the events included steroid injection five days after the vaccine. The events resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit then emergency room/department or urgent care.

                                                I developed a severe rash that traveled throughout my body after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  It started 3 days after the dose as a rash and within 12 hours it spread to hives and then covered my entire chest, back, neck, arms and face - my ears became swollen.  Over the course of several days, the rash spread down my torso and down my legs.  The rash turned black and blue in certain areas.  It was very itchy.  I was seen at Hospital ER, seen by a dermatologist,seen by an allergist and seen by my primary care phsyician.    I was treated with prendisone,  Hydroxyzine, Benadryl and Zyrtec.   I was required to get blood work to check my platelets and liver.    Doctors report that this was an allergic reaction.   After the one week the rash subsided, and at this time although it is not fully resolved,  the rash does not make me uncomfortable.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm (at the age of 64 years) on 24Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes (borderline about 15 years ago/started taking a medication a year ago for her high sugar numbers/had some blood tests, her A1C was normal, her diabetes was the same way it always has been); hypertension from 2012 (diagnosed about 9 years ago); sleep apnea from 2020 (uses a C-PAP machine/diagnosed approximately a year ago); Epstein Barr from 1995 (diagnosed when she was 39); high cholesterol (sometimes she didn&#39;t take her medication for that); cataract and cataract surgery in Jan2021 (had this last month/they used anesthesia/didn&#39;t know which type/had some eye drops for this). Concomitant medication included an unspecified high blood pressure medication (she thinks she tried a few times). The patient called about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and she had questions and side effects. She did get one shot, and was not due for her second for a couple weeks. The patient felt sick since she got it, some side effects have been less, some stayed the same or got worse. Her skin was burning up, her arms, her face, her stomach, her back, and her chest were burning up. She has done no treatment, because she didn&#39;t know what to do to treat it and it was difficult to be able to get in to see a doctor. The burning skin has probably gotten worse. She also had nausea and no appetite, though she has gotten a little better, it has been at least a full week or so. She had a headache and a bad sore throat also. She got home from getting the shot, probably maybe 5 or 6 hours after getting the shot. The patient&#39;s weight was 145-150lbs. The outcome of the event skin burning sensation was not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

                                                As the needle was being inserted and while the vaccine was being injected, I immediately felt intense pain like none I&#39;ve had during any prior vaccine administration . The needle was inserted very high on the arm about 1/2 inch below the shoulder.  About 4:00 pm that afternoon, new pain developed in the same shoulder, along with very limited range of motion, gradually worsening during next few hours. By 9:00pm the pain was excruciating, like there were multiple knives in all directions in my shoulder. By then I could not lift or move my arm any amount in any direction without excruciating pain.  I suspected a severe inflammatory response. This pain level continued for the next 2 days.  On the 3rd day the pain was a little less severe and I had slightly more range of motion, but was still unable to lift my arm without pain. On the 4th day (Feb. 18) the pain was a little better but I still had severe sharp pain if I lifted my arm in certain directions. I began to suspect a torn muscle or tendon. Today (March 5, almost 3 weeks after the vaccine), the pain and limited range of motion are the same as Feb. 18.  It is relieved only by complete rest of the arm, and easily aggravated by any basic activity (grocery shopping, dressing, etc.)  I believe my shoulder was injured by improper administration.

                                                Rash; Welts; she had a very sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient herself). A 65-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as Pfizer Covid Vaccine, lot EH9099 or EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in her left deltoid on 22Dec2020 09:32 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included broken toe for 3 weeks. This was from her taekwondo and doesn&#39;t complain. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect drug. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date with Covid-19 vaccine. There were no concomitant medications. On 24Dec2020, she broke out in a rash on different parts of her body. She said the rash would come and go. She said she then had welts appear on different parts of her body and the welts would come and go. She said on the 3rd day, she had rash and welts together only on her trunk. She said on days 4, 5, and 6, she would have either a rash or welts come and go on different parts of her body. She clarified she had the rash and welts on her hands, wrists, ankles, and body. She reported that the rash and welts were serious-medically significant. On 22Dec2020, she had arm soreness and was just inconvenient and uncomfortable. She said she was not saying that what she was experiencing was related to receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, but she doesn&#39;t know what else can be causing the rash and welts. She said she hasn&#39;t changed anything she has been eating or doing. She said she was worried about taking the 2nd COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She used Hydrocortisone 1% cream, Equate brand (reported to be expired) and took an oatmeal bath. She also took Benadryl and brand of Zyrtec called Wal-Zyr. Her height was 175cm, weight was 63kg. The rash and welts recovered on 30Dec2020; arm soreness recovered on 23Dec2020.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events rash and urticaria cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 17:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidaemia. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), ezetimibe (ZETIA), rosuvastatin, fexofenadine, ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin a [retinol], vitamin c [ascorbic acid], tocopherol (VITAMIN E), thiamine (VITAMIN B1) , vitamin b2 [riboflavin], niacin, vitamin b6, folic acid, cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12) , biotin, pantothenic acid.  Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received the first dose of Pfizer vaccination on Thursday, 17Dec2020 at 5 PM. I began to have an adverse reaction on Friday, 18Dec2020 at 11 PM and then until the Saturday, 19Dec2020 until after dinner I had (Incomplete sentence). You want me to break it down like what the time and what the affect was? Okay 11 PM on Friday 18th my hands swelled up, they were red and they were itchy. I couldn&#39;t get the itching to stop. Hand cream or cold water they finally subsided with cold water and I was able to get sleep. Then I woke up Saturday, 19Dec2020 at 6 AM then was my hands, my feet swollen, red and itchy. Itching was just like, I did not know what to do about it. Used cold water and that rested for about 4 hours. After that stopped I had a rash on my arms, my leg and my abdomen and it just came out of nowhere. It was red like a bubbly rash like a size of pea. You think I looked at I thought what I was going to do. I went I got a cool shower another 4 hours that subsided not completely but enough where it wasn&#39;t scary anymore, it was bearable. Closer to dinner time I had Lymphadenopathy under both arms, red, swollen then I took another 4 to 5 hours to subside. During this I have sore arm that was slightly swollen. The arm was swollen, the shoulder was swollen and the clavicle area was also swollen and that&#39;s my reaction. I work in healthcare and I was just at a point I went to work, I reported the incident and I filed a VARIS report. I talked to my administrator she said I should call Pfizer, let them know. I spoke to my primary doctor, to let him know. I just wanted to report this to someone.&#34;Registered Nurse stated, &#34;My work place. It was offered in &#39;(Name)&#39; hospital (not clarified).&#34; Treatment: Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I took Tylenol. I took it three times and that would have been a &#39;1000 mg&#39; each time (Not clarified).&#34;When probed for the Causality, Registered Nurse stated, &#34;Yes.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

However, this morning, her arm is still the same. Caller wanted to know if she can still continue to take paracetamol and use the icepacks and just give it some time or what. She knows the redness, swelling, warmth are some side effects but she wanted to just follow-up to see if she can continue to take the paracetamol. Caller verifies she received her first vaccine on 06Jan2021. Last night, 07Jan2021, around 9 pm, she started to get the warmth, redness, and swelling. She states her arm looks the same as it did last night. However, her arm is beginning to itch (08Jan2021). It wasn&#39;t itching last night. She explains the vaccine was available to her. She took it because of her age and knowing she works in the medical field, she is around a lot of young people and patients, and also for her family and friends. She knows some other people who have had COVID and she didn&#39;t want to take any chances.  None of additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect.

                                                Second COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 - The patient is  received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine at Hospital.   Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine I lost complete hearing in my left ear. I waited until the next morning to see if hearing would return. It did not and I contacted my doctor at the Clinic and was referred for an audiology test on Thursday at 9:30am followed by a appointment with an ENT. My hearing loss was profound and I was started on high dosages of steroids for a 14 day course of action. I also had a head MRI done on Monday February 8 with no significant findings. My hearing has begun to improve but at this point is not back to normal and it may never be the same. My biggest question is whether or not I should take the second vaccine. I also have a significant bruise at the injection sight that I still have 10 days later.

I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: L9261) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 27Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Sjogren&#39;s syndrome from 2015 (sees her Rheumatologist/ do blood work once a year to make sure her inflammation levels are okay), ongoing rosacea; dry eye syndrome (related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome); spasming, burning and twitching (last 2 medications she was on in November and January she had similar type reactions in her muscles); arthritis flareup from Oct2019 (in her left leg, she saw her neurologist who did tests and they came back normal) and sinus infection in 2020. Ongoing concomitant medication included ciclosporin (RESTASIS) for Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) for blood test: deficient and ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION) for dry eye syndrome related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient previously took prednisone from Nov2020 and experienced weirdness in her legs got strong enough to keep her up at night and bad flare up for her leg symptoms; metronidazole for flare up or Rosacea (0.75% as needed, which she has used daily for last few weeks), meloxicam in Nov2020 and pantoprazole in Jan2021 and had bad flare up for her leg symptoms (symptoms subsided as soon as she stopped taking the medication after about 5 days); ibuprofen, acetaminophen and pepcid for her stomach. She had the vaccine, her first dose, on 27Jan2021, about a week ago. The first two days she didn&#39;t notice anything and then she had weird sensations in her legs on 28Jan2021. The second night she had a weird sensation in her legs which was similar to what she had experienced with the two medications she took in November and January. On 30Jan2021 the sensations spread through her body, she describes these sensations as twitching, burning, cramping, and tingling. She clarifies the sensations moved to her arms which did not happen with the other medications that she tried in November and January. Monday night, 01Feb2021, she was up all night and couldn&#39;t sleep and says she called the family doctor yesterday and he called in a prescription for Gabapentin 100 mg. She said she took the medication last night and she did sleep last night, but she was unsure if it was from exhaustion from the last few nights from not sleeping or the medicine, but she did sleep better and her symptoms were a lot less last night. Patient said she wanted to report this and that her concern is with the second dose; will she have a worse reaction, is there anything she can do or take and should she be concerned about it. She said the events gradually increased, they started mildly and then became significant. She felt the sensations a little bit in the day time but they start big time in the night when laying down. These sensations experienced in her legs started the second night, 28Jan2021, and then spread to her arms in the last couple of days which had not happened with her other incidences (with the medications mentioned above back in November and January). Clarified that the sensations spread to her arms on 29Jan2021, but the worst nights were 31Jan2021 and 01Feb2021. She said they were bad nights. She said in regard to her sleeping, starting on 29Jan2021, she was restless, she had trouble getting sleep and trouble getting in a comfortable position. She woke up frequently. Saturday the sleeping was a little worse, but she did sleep. She said on Sunday, 31Jan2021, and Monday, 01Feb2021, she hardly got any sleep. The sensations spread to her arms and it probably started a little on Saturday night, but Sunday and Monday it was very noticeable. She started Gabapentin; it was one a day before bed. The leg symptoms were still there last night. The sensations in her arms were not much at all.

She clarified on 30Dec2020 she took Naproxen, Ibuprofen, and Tylenol for her symptoms, and nothing helped her.

She said at the moment the petechia rash shows up on her leg, she knows she is going to have a muscle spasm in that area. She said last night she had 2 petechia rashes show up on the lateral side of her right ankle. She said the petechia rash started to burn, and her right leg calf muscle became heavy. She said she could tell her right leg calf muscle was going to start to spasm, so she took some coconut oil and applied the coconut oil to her right leg calf muscle and massaged her right calf muscle. She said she had 2 areas of petechia last night (23Feb2021). She said the first time the petechia was noticed was when she went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021. She said the petechia has been persisting since that time. She said prior to being admitted to the hospital she never had dry skin or itching, but now she has dry skin and itching.

                                                Felt very much like I was going to faint.  Had nausea and without proper breathing and fighting through it, I would have passed out.  And I was driving.  The pain during the injection was one of the most severe I&#39;ve ever had.  It was injected in the top part of my shoulder where there is nothing but bone.

First noted a painful, firm, pea-sized pink area exactly 24 hours after receiving dose #1 of the Pfizer vaccine (1/15/21, 6:15PM). Within 24 hours this enlarged to ~ 4cm, remaining firm, red, tender, subdermal. It is gradually reducing in size as of 1/22/2021 (1-week post-vaccine), now ~2.5 cm, but still very red and painful. No fluctuance or break in the skin. No other symptoms (fever, rash, etc). Concern for immune-mediated granulomatous reaction.

There is also some mild swelling. No pain or itching.  I have had no other symptoms since receiving this vaccine, not even a sore arm at the injection site.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 19Jan2021 at 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. The patient did not have any other vaccine in four weeks, did not have other medications in two weeks, did not have COVID prior to vaccination, has no known allergies, and was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. On 24Jan2021 at 08:00, the patient experienced pink raised bumps with clear top filled with fluid that looked like tiny blisters with intense itching only on the vaccinated arm. Rash appeared on day 6 after injection and two new locations on same arm erupted after 4 more days. Scarring and itching up for two weeks. The patient was not tested for COVID after vaccination. As treatment, Permethrin cream was used to see if it was scabies to &#34;no eff&#34;. The adverse events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and disability or permanent damage. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association  and/or known drug profile a contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events  cannot  be totally excluded.

Just thought it was my eczema flaring up (it&#39;s worse in the winter).  After about 2 weeks, developed red areas on my body (torso, arms, legs and feet)  - self-monitored - but got progressively worse.  Dermatologist believes it is eczema aggravated by the vaccine.  Provided  a cortisone injection (right arm).  Will monitor for two weeks to determine improvement or lack of improvement.

A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EN6201, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Feb2021 at 04:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medications included tolterodine and adalimumab (HUMIRA). The patient reported that she received the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 at around 4:30. Firstly it was fine, she felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore. What concerned her was the swelling started almost immediately after the shot on 18Feb2021. She knew that was one of the symptoms. This morning and yesterday though (18Feb2021), she noticed some of the symptoms. She got a large knot that was right above the injection site. Yesterday, it was about the size of a half dollar, today it is about the size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot. It feels like an egg under the skin or a clot. Like a knot (a hard spot underneath the skin). The patient was wondering if it was something she should be concerned about because the swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area. It was a rectangle and is about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high and then right above that was where the needle went in. The large circle or knot was right above that and she was thinking possibly when she was given the injection she has never really bleed before. So, she thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm. She got no problem. That happens at times, but she started thinking if this was a clot or it was something that is right above there because it is so pronounced, and it really hurts. The patient stated that she took some Aspirin last night and is going to take an ibuprofen in a little while. She mentioned that she takes this one pill and it has nothing to do with anything.  The patient had lab work done (unknown results) that was about 3 weeks ago (2021). She also stated that she also take Humira which is a shot every 2 weeks and it said in the fact sheet that she should be concerned or be sure that she did not take any medicine that affects the immune system and Humira does weaken the immune system but she was not ask that prior to. The patient wanted to know if is that something she should be concerned about. Outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                The evening after patient received vaccine, she started to develop low grade fever and urticarial rash at the vaccine site. The urticaria improved the following day, as did the fevers. Then 3/5, the fevers started again, several times per day, as high as 102 at home.  In association with the fever she has had some mild nausea, x1 non-bloody emesis last night, as well as rigors/night sweats.  She went to urgent care and eventually was admitted to the hospital for the following 9 days. During this admission, she continued to have fevers intermittently as high as ~103. She also developed more generalized urticarial rash (worst on trunk), and lab abnormalities including low platelets and elevated liver function tests. She had extensive testing, ultimately determined likely vaccine reaction, started on prednisone 40 daily and improved for discharge to home on 3/17 without fevers x48 hours and with improving labs.

The heaviest shaking was of the right arm and hand which was where the vaccine was administered. Made my way to bedroom on my walker to tell hubby I was not feeling well,  Took blood pressure which was elevated and my heart felt like it was beating out my chest, Bllod pressure was elevated and so was pulse. Shaking continued and breathing was shallow, Waited 10 minutes and retook vitals, BP and pulse up more, Called 911, Paramedics came and monitored my vitals several times which after 20 minutes started declining, Could not say conclusively if was vaccine related. Elected due to Covid not to be transported to hospital and signed off on declination, Was told by paramedics to call 911 again if symptoms reoccurred and go to hospital,  In successive days I still continue to have pin-prick feelings and numbness in my right fingers, More difficult to walk than usual,

Dr., my internist, agrees that what happened was not a vasovagal syncope (hospital?s diagnosis).   My Experience: Within say 7 minutes of the injection I felt woozy, the wooziness intensified, I got intense pins and needles in my lower legs, fore arms and hands, and less so in my face. My speech became very slowed down, slurred  and I had a lot of difficulty forming words. It was as if I was extremely drunk. After they called the paramedics, I was not able to get myself out of my car or walk.  I lost motor coordination/control in hands and feet.  I was cold, never felt faint, and had slightly evaluated blood pressure for me( normal is 110/64 paramedics got it at 152/94).

When I got home, I removed my shirt and noticed I had a red blotch and lump at the vaccination site.  It no longer itches, but I still have the red splotches and a slight lump under the skin.  I want to know if it is safe to get the second vaccine. I already plan to get it in the opposite arm.

But at 4:30 am  2/22/2021 I was awakened by intense  itching on my left arm and hand.  Over the next 2 hours the itching increased in intensity and progressed to my right arm and hand, over my upper back and shoulders, and along the back of my thighs and buttocks.        I took 2 Benadryl allergy tablets (25mg) and used Benadryl GEL extra strength on the affected areas.  This resulted in my sleepiness for the remainder of the day. Contacted my physicians office for an appointment to resolve the issue.

                                                I received the 2nd Covid injection.  I went to the 15-minute waiting area.  The waiting area was full, so my husband and I were standing.  I stand and work every day, so this was not difficult.  I texted my daughter, who is a hospital employee, and told her that we had a super experience with no wait and had already received our 2nd dose.  However, 5 to 7 minutes after the injection, I SUDDENLY felt dizzy and weak and had to sit down.  Within a minute or so, I could not stand or open my eyes.  The weakness made it difficult to breath or talk.  My husband had to lift me up into a wheelchair.  I was taken to the ER.  For the longest time, I could not even open my eyes or talk above a whisper. After 4 hours, I was able to get my eyes open and talk better.  I, gradually, was able to move my hands and feet.  Last of all, I could move my hips and walk.   It was as if my body had been put to sleep.  I could feel everything but my body wouldn?t move.  As it wore off, my face and limbs felt slightly tingly.  I was, basically, fine after 5 hours other than being tired from the experience. The doctors had no explanation for what happened and said it must be an emotional response to getting the shot.  They wrote that I was not exerting enough effort to move my body.  One said that I was hyperventilating when I pulled my mask up to breathe after he told me to hold my leg in the air.  Though I tried, I was too weak to hold my leg up and it fell to the bed. The doctor told me that I should not tell anyone about what had happened or people would not come to get the Covid vaccination.  He obviously knew that SOMETHING had happened that I couldn&#39;t control but he didn&#39;t put that in his report!

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed.

It dawned on her later when she was not feeling good. Late Wednesday afternoon it was like everything cratered and she felt horrible. She was feeling bad. She was freezing and had chills. It was a horrible feeling. She helps with her grandkids since she is retired. They were home from school and had to sit on the couch. She felt cold, yucky, and achy. It was a yucky feeling. She went home a couple of hours later. She told her husband she had to lie down on the couch because she felt horrible. She could not further describe horrible feeling. Her daughter had called her as well and was unable to describe how she felt to her daughter. She could only say she felt so sick but could not explain further. She felt awful and could not put her finger on it. She was laying down and when she got up, she felt like she would pass out. At that time, she had not eaten dinner yet. She ate dinner, took one bite and the food came back up. For a few moments she felt so faint, she felt shortness of breath, but it was only for a few seconds. After that, her and her and her husband took a drive to go to hospital. However, by the time she got to hospital she was feeling better. She was also talking to a friend at that time who said all of this was probably form the shot as well. Since she was feeling better decided not to go into the hospital and went back home. At the time she was thinking this was all from the shot and no big deal. On Wednesday night, things got crazy and worse. That evening Wednesday she was getting ready for bed and noticed her cheeks were flushed. On Thursday she got up and noticed rash. She was covered all over her body. It did not itchy really, but it was a rash. Not a bumpy rash, it reminds her of Roseola. Her joints and fingers were starting to swell. Her hands were swollen.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration, at the left shoulder on 29Dec2020 around 3:00-4:00pm at single dose for immunisation .  Medical history included ongoing Sjogren&#39;ssyndrome, Raynaud&#39;s disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, two other conditions which the patient cannot remember, was on blood thinner, immunocompromised or on medication that compromises your immune system-all of which apply to her.  Concomitant medication included hydroxychloroquine (PLAQUENIL), warfarin, aspirin all from about 15-20 years ago as a blood thinner. On 29Dec2020, patient felt like the vaccine has affected her a bit as she was feeling a bit achy and she can definitely tell where the injection was administered because sometime last night she rolled over and thought well she won&#39;t be sleeping on that left arm after getting the vaccine injection in her left shoulder. She was not sure if her feeling a bit achy is just the day, or related to the vaccine. Patient did not read the product paperwork until last night when she got home after having been administered the vaccine. She was given an approximate date of her second scheduled dose around 19Jan2021; that is not necessarily the date she will get the second dose; that depends on the next clinic date at the county health department. No plan to change dose unless advised to. The patient has not yet recovered from the events.

                                                26 hours post I took a hot shower.  While drying off, I noticed my legs itching. I applied Vaseline Intensive Care lotion like I usually to after shower and noticed my legs and feet were pretty red. I called my husband in to look at my back, nothing on back, chest or arms. Considered taking a Benadryl due to itch and redness but afraid it would make me sleepy at 4:00 pm. Then over a period of about 15 minutes total after stepping out of the shower, it was fading quickly along with the itching and completely gone within  20 minutes. The lotion helped the itching about 75% initially.

Vital signs were taken.  Blood pressure up slightly, heart rate slightly elevated Sent home without treatment but recommended I should take antihistamine at home. I took a 12-hour allegra about 12pm and a single 25 mg benadryl tablet at bedtime. The symptoms lasted about 3-4 hours before resolving.  They did not get worse from the immediate reaction. Recommended contacting my family physician for advice of what to do before 2nd shot which is scheduled for Feb. 15, 2021

They are trying to figure out, she has water in her ear she has had CT scans recently trying to check for any problems that could be corrected surgically and that was all clean. She has had a mammogram, she was not sure about the mammogram yet but she thinks they would have called her if there was a problem with that. Historical vaccine included Just mild stuff with the flu vaccine for immunisation on occasion she has had similar reactions that were very mild with the flu vaccine and last year she had none of that at all. She says when she has had any other vaccine, she had no reaction other than maybe a slightly sore arm. No other products. She did have some mild side effects. She was really glad she got this shot. She said she had experienced some chilling on 13Jan2021, these are all very mild symptoms. She had a sore throat on 13Jan2021, some aching, like body aches on 13Jan2021 and joint tenderness on 13Jan2021. She just got chilled every once in a while. It was not very bad. She said the sore throat had persisted about the same, but the coffee helped. She was having some swelling at the injection site that was about the same as when it began on 13Jan2021. She was having some arm tenderness on 13Jan2021. She did not have any adverse reactions yesterday (12Jan2021) she was so excited to get it. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Approximately 2 days after the second injection, a large red flat rash (about 3&#34; x 3&#34;) began to form on my R arm, around and beneath the injection site.  Shortly after that, an extremely intense itching set in and lasted for 48 hours or so.  The itching was extreme, and not helped by either Benadryl or topical hydrocortosone cream.  The itching was  worse than that produced by exposure to poison ivy.     I experienced a similar reaction to the second Shingrix (shingles) injection, although the red rash that occurred after this injection was a bit raised and welt-like, in places.  Itching was also extreme, and very difficult to tolerate.  It, too, lasted about 48-72 hours.    Interestingly, I did NOT have this type of reaction to my annual flu shot this year, nor have I ever had such a reaction before.    I&#39;d like to know what inactive ingredients are common to both the Shingrix and Pfizer vaccines, as I suspect that something like that is the culprit.  Also seeking advice about what to do when boosters are recommended, if they are, for Covid-19.

Saw opthmologist prescribed Acyclovir.  Over a couple days swelling dissapeared and burning, itching subsided.  The thing is, I had my second COVID dose on 02/10/2021,  10:00AM Pitzer Lot #9581.  On 02/18/2021 late evening, started to feel burning in left eye nose area again, next morning eye swollen shut.  Saw Dr, said I was having an allergic reaction and put me on prednesone and Amoxicylin.  No reduction of swelling and burning, blisters were forming.  Went to Urgent Care on 2/20/2021 and was prescribed Acyclovir again.  Swelling now gone and itching burning diminished.

I knew there was potential for side effects before taking the vaccine...I was totally unprepared for so many symptoms and how intense they were and what little I could do to relieve any of them. Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

So then i left it alone because I didn&#39;t now if that was part of a reaction. When i got home i still had the odor in my mouth. i drank cold water and it went away. I waited. I felt sore on my arm but it wasn&#39;t that bad but as the hours went on it started getting more sore and painful. My arm was sore up to my shoulder and the back. After that the pain started traveling towards to my chest and i started getting pain in my chest. i took Tylenol (1 500 mg extra strength at 11:15 PM). So i waited 15 minutes to go to sleep. i got up the next day and everything was the same, i started putting ice on it and gave it time. I took another Tylenol but the pain was in my chest again a little bit. The third day the pain didn&#39;t come back in my chest and from then i was alright. I also started getting an itch.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in the left shoulder area on 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included COPD (has it for lots of years) and nickel sensitivity. She does not have any reactions to her previous unspecified vaccines but had a normal reaction like sore arm. Concomitant medication included bimatoprost (LUMIGAN).  The patient previously received flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, both for immunization in 2020 around the end of Sep or beginning of Oct. The patient reported side effects regarding the COVID vaccine and said she was a little confused and unsure if she was having a problem or if she should see a doctor. On 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM, she had the first dose of the COVID vaccine and afterward she had a lot of effects which were mostly muscle and body aches in Jan2021. She also experienced some ongoing congestion in one nostril but saw this as just more congestion and that she was having to blow her nose more in Jan2021. She did the (app name) report but didn&#39;t report the stuffiness. She did report that in the first few days she felt like she was having the onset of pneumonia and felt tired and run down (Jan2021). Two days ago, she started feeling itchy (Jan2021) and she didn&#39;t know what it was, she didn&#39;t know if she ate something or what. Now she has developed a rash (Jan2021) which is ongoing until now. Her paperwork said the rash would happen right away if it was caused by the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if this is something she should be concerned about and if the rash could appear or started this long after she had the vaccine. Her second dose is due on 06Feb2021. The patient wanted to know if the vaccine contains nickel or any metal substances in it since she had compared her rash to her nickel sensitivity. The patient wanted to know if rash is a side effect from the vaccine and how long it will last. She didn&#39;t put rash down for the safety check either as she didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine. Today her rash, she is so itchy. She does have it on her neck and certain areas but not everywhere. It looks like what would happen after a bad fever. It is not raised but is like a fever type rash.  She did note that she had an increase dose of a medication eye drops (Lumigan; Lot: T and a 0 or O followed by 544, and NDC: 0023320503. Expiry: Jan2022) around the time the rash started but after getting the vaccine. Her head, neck and back are very itchy. She mentioned that she waited 2 days and did not put this event in the (app name). She would have reported it yesterday, but she didn&#39;t get one yesterday. She also noted that it was very dry there and cold and a person is going to get dry skin.  She does have an allergic to metal and wondered if that was in the product. In her neck area, it looks just like when she would wear a cheap necklace. No treatments received. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit.  The patient has no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient had not yet recovered from events rash/like a fever type rash and congestion in one nostril/stuffiness; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

However, it isn&#39;t on the list of side effects but I&#39;ve had hot flashes every few hours since about and  2 hours after my first dose injection.  For the most part they are mild but come on every 1 to 4 hours while I&#39;m awake.  I had a terrible one like I&#39;d never had before where I was soaked through my clothes almost exactly 24 hours after the shot the following day.  They are still occurring now 72 hours after the shot.  they are mostly bothersome and will hopefully subside in the next few days.  Other than that I only had the normal local tenderness on my arm.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

A contactable other health care professional reported that a 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot EL9263) via an unspecified route of administration at arm left on 24Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included drug allergies, IV contrast reaction. The concomitant medication was not reported. It was reported patient got the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine Sunday 24Jan2021 at 13: 00PM in the left arm. She was scheduled for the second dose of the vaccine 16Feb2021. she got the vaccine and was perfectly fine; she started the wait time of 45 minutes and about 10 minutes into it she got really hot and felt like her heart was racing fast; felt dizzy on 24Jan2021. A nurse practitioner and a doctor came over and sat with her; she got some water and she was okay. They thought it was anxiety related to coming into a crowd, but for the next 36 hours she continued to feel anxious and on edge; she felt like she had too much caffeine. That night she had trouble sleeping; she had sharp pain in her muscles on 24Jan2021, it would be in one of her thighs then the other one. This was about 12 hours after the vaccine. States she took some tylenol and it did help. Adds she just continued to feel anxious and she was sweaty. States she has never has anything like this before. Today she felt perfectly fine; all of her symptoms had resolved. Then today, when she was driving to a routine GYN exam and she experienced a terrible itching on her left arm on 24Jan2021.

She stated she tried to stay calm and forced herself to drink a bottle of water. She had no idea where there was any emergency area since she was not familiar with the area and tried to calm herself down and took sips of water and made sure she was breathing okay and it all went away. The reaction lasted 10-15 minutes and seem to resolve when she was able to calm herself down. She stated it was scary, and once she calmed down it all went away.  She was concerned about receiving the second dose. She did not go to a physician or emergency room, but says she probably should have.

The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 69-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9264; expiry date: unknown) intramuscular in the left arm, on 01Feb2021 between 16:00-16:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical History included Right-sided Breast Cancer over 30 years ago. No lymph nodes were involved, so she didn&#39;t need chemotherapy or radiation. She had breast reconstruction and right mastectomy performed. She also had 2 hip replacements. Other medical history included nerve disorder and car accident. She has had bad nerves since she was 18 years old. She said she hasn&#39;t worked in over 30-something years because she worked so much to raise her kids by herself and send them to college. She said her psychiatrist and a doctor told her she had to stop working. She walks 5 miles every day and has no underlying conditions. Concomitant medications included an unspecified nighttime medication for her nerves and pain medication because she was in a car accident. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EK9231) in the left arm, on 11Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The patient did not have previous immunization with a Pfizer vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The vaccine was administered in a Field. The patient reported that she got her second Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 01Feb2021. After she got the second COVID-19 vaccine shot she was okay for a while, then she had a little injection site pain immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine injection. She said the injection site pain was gone, clarifying if she mashes the injection site, the injection site doesn&#39;t hurt. She was only able to have shots on her left arm because she had a right mastectomy, so she can&#39;t have anything on her right side. On 02Feb2021, the big boom hit, and it has been all day. She has been breathing well and has no temperature. On the same day (02Feb2021) the patient experienced run of pain that pops up here, and there, and everywhere. She had a headache, as well. She was concerned if should take anything for the pain. She does not want to do what is not right. She wanted to do things the way that Pfizer has suggested. She put heat around face, neck, and arms, but now the pain was going down her body. She has been microwaving rice in a bag and using the heated bagged rice to apply heat to her face, neck and arms. She had a physical recently with unknown results, but she had no recent blood work. The events did not require emergency or physician visit. Outcome of the event injection site pain was recovered on 02Feb2021, while for the other events was not recovered.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient stated on 16Jan2021, &#34;I had the COVID Vaccine on the 14th (14Jan2021). I had just pain on my arm, no side effects. But today I noticed that I had a red spot where I had the vaccine and it was itchy, so I had, but it is mild. It is nothing that&#39;s all over me, I have got a rash or anything. Just on the side it looks little red and itches and it still hurts and when I touch it, I do feel like a little bit of a bump, little bit. Is this an allergic reaction and therefore for my second dosage, will that be may not react or what?&#34; Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took shingles vaccine for immunization and experienced shingles. The patient reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night and into 18Jan2021, she felt scratchy in her throat. She did not think anything of it because the temperature change was not unusual in the patient&#39;s state and so she thought it was that. But, on 19Jan2021, her throat was more scratchy and then her nose started running more. By Wednesday, 20Jan2021, her nose was like a faucet, non stop, clear and her throat was definitely scratchy and she was sneezing non stop. Her injection site was sore too which she totally expected. Now, her physician has given her a steroid pack and did a rapid test, which was negative but the following day they are doing a PCR test, so, she will see. She also stated that she can still smell but can&#39;t taste and that started last night, 20Jan2021. She asked if they were seeing these. And if this was listed or being reported and if she should get the second dose. She went on to state that &#34;I would not call my symptoms severe and I&#39;m having my PCR tomorrow, but when they mention to me that they have had other patients with this experience&#34;. She also asked if it can it give her COVID since her symptoms were similar to COVID and other people are having symptoms. She also reported that 4 months ago, she got her first shingles vaccination and &#34;it knocked me on my butt, I still haven&#39;t got the second injection but I got shingles&#34; and asked should she have gotten the COVID vaccine if she just got over shingles 3-4 weeks ago. She reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 and her second dose is scheduled for 30Jan2021 (17days apart). She did not have a question about the timing of the vaccine, only mentioned when her second dose was due and the it was 17 days after the first. She wanted to know if Pfizer was seeing a lot of this, and it could this her body reacting to the vaccine. She wanted to know what she should do with the second vaccine, if she should get it. She works at a school and has been making sure to wash her hands and everything. The outcome of the events Rhinorrhoea, and Vaccination site pain was unknown. The outcome of the event ageusia was not recovered while the outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082498 same drug/event, different patients

Patient received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. She stated, on Tuesday 26Jan2021, patient was hurting on the waist around the back. On Wednesday, 27Jan2021, that next morning, she went to see her internal doctor and they thought a kidney infection or not; he was not sure if she had a kidney infection or what was going on. Patient went home and it got worse and patient went to the ER (Jan2021), also reported as ended up going to the ER. They did a CT scan gave her medicine. They did a CT scan and said it was not her bladder or anything (Jan2021). They thought it was diverticulitis; nothing helped. They gave her medication and she kept getting sick (2021).

On Friday, 29Jan2021, early morning, patient went back to the ER, they did another CT with contrast it wasn&#39;t diverticulitis, but it was shingles, and patient have had shingles before, this was the 4th time. It was reported that when the doctor came in, he thought this was shingles and she has had shingles previously. She has had it about 3 other times and the pain was just off the scale (Jan2021).  Her blood pressure went up to 211/92 and they were giving her morphine for the pain (Jan2021).  She was questioning if she should get the second dose. She has two autoimmune diseases and it was an overactive immune disease.  She took the one vaccine and her doctor said to contact Pfizer being as it is kind of new and especially since she has the autoimmune issues.  She would like to know if it is safe for her to have the second vaccine.  She does not know if she will be over this.  She does not feel well (Jan2021).  She was afraid of taking it if it will be any worse (Jan2021). Patient felt all right until she had the vaccine, on Tuesday the problem started (26Jan2021).

As sick as she has been, and her overactive immune system and if she still has the shingles those can last a long time, she doesn&#39;t want to go through what she went through. This was a lot of pain and with shingles they can last, 6 months or a year. The nurse called her back and told her to report to Pfizer. Patient was taking the medicine for the shingles right now. She doesn&#39;t know what will happen. She doesn&#39;t want to be sick. Patient asked for the efficacy after 1 dose and how much protection it has. She did fill out something because she talked with someone else.  She confirmed it was through VAERS and not with Pfizer. She said the pain around her waist was a little better because they gave her the medicine for shingles and she has pain pills. She said one was Valacyclovir and she could not remember the name of the other. Patient had required two trips to ER.  First one was on 27Jan2021 and went to internal medicine doctor and that night went to the ER.  They did CT scan and it was not bladder or anything. Second visit on 29Jan2021 and did CT with contrast and the doctor thought it was shingles since she had shingles three times before.  She has had them internally.  The doctor said it would not necessarily need to be externally break outs.  The next two times she did not break out.  She did not have anything around her waist. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events hurting on my waist around the back, kidney infection, diverticulitis, shingles, and sick. The outcome of the event hurting on my waist around the back was recovering. The outcome of the event kidney infection, diverticulitis, shingles, sick, blood pressure went up to 211/92, does not feel well, and &#34;afraid of taking it if it will be any worse&#34; was unknown.

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either. She just noticed she was flushed red. She called the doctor first, and he said that he was sending information to the emergency room. Then she went to (name of place withheld) ER. They took her temperature, there was no fever. She was then relieved from the ER in 2.5 hours and went home. She still has redness on the skin. In the hospital, they gave her 40 mg of prednisone and an injection or Benadryl, and prescription for prednisone to take for the next 4 days while tapering down. She did take Benadryl about 2 hours ago, she did notice all the sudden she was getting itchy. She is less itchy now. With the itchiness, she just observed this about 2 hours ago. She took Benadryl, she has somewhat improved, she is still itchy but not to the point that she will scratch heavily. She does not have her COVID CDC Card at the moment, her husband has that information but he is on a conference call with a client and she cant disturb him. The patient was scheduled for a second dose on 06Mar2021. That&#39;s where she has a question, the doctor is saying that he is not sure about getting second shot. They took lab work at the hospital and said everything was fine except for white blood cell count, it was on the lower side in Feb2021. She has had no vaccines on the same day or in the 4 weeks prior. She hasn&#39;t had any vaccines. She did have to visit the emergency room. She only called the doctors office, the doctor said not to come in and go tot he ER. She has No relevant family medical history that she would like to share. The severe allergic reaction, &#34;skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen&#34;, injection site pain, redness of the skin, itchiness, joint muscle pain and whole body was in pain was recovering. The event tiredness recovered with sequelae on 15Feb2021 and the event joint and muscle pain was recovered on 16Feb2021. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL8982, expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included anaphylaxis with insect bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took codeine and diazepam (VALIUM) and experienced hyperkinetic reaction. The patient stated that she received the vaccine on 14Jan2021, and that day 6 hours later, she had headache, fever, chills and body ache; and the next day on 15Jan2021, when she woke up, she had rash on legs, arms, chest and stomach, and she still had the rash. On an unspecified date, the patient had 3 days with out sleeping. The patient assessed the events as non-serious. The patient further reported that she was hyperkinetic and she has had that reaction many years prior reporting, before when taking codeine or VALIUM, one of the ingredients in VALIUM. She went to the doctor the first day, who saw her rash and told her to report that. It was not itching. The patient had the appointment for the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, this coming Thursday and wanted to know if there would be a problem to get the second dose. She was afraid to get the vaccine the first time, because she had a history of anaphylaxis with insect bites. She carried an epi pen, and the vaccine provider had one too and the paramedics was there, and everything was okay; they were nice with her. The patient didn&#39;t have any problem until later. The patient spoke to her health care professional and he thought it was okay for her to get the second dose and the health care professional just told her to put a cream on her rash. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rash on legs, arms, chest and stomach, which included putting a cream on her rash. The patient was not recovered from the rash on legs, arms, chest and stomach, while the outcome of the events &#34;headache, fever, chills, body ache, and 3 days with out sleeping&#34; was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

A 70-years-old female patient received first bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9269), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 10:31 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included covid-19 from 2020 to an unknown date, fall from Jan2021 to an unknown date (She went to orthopedic doctor on 10Jan2021 who gave her a Toradol shot and unknown injection in the knee; she thinks the unknown injection was a steroid or whatever they call it for the pain in her knee because she has bone on bone osteoarthritis) , ongoing Penicillin allergy while she was in her 20s , anxiety, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure abnormal.  Concomitant medication included clonazepam (KLONOPIN, Tablet) 1/2 tablet taken as needed for Anxiety, duloxetine (DULOXETINE) for 60 mg, daily, metformin 500 mg, once daily for diabetes, hydrochlorothiazide/losartan potassium (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM AND HCTZ) 50mg/12.5mg tablet once daily for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate 50 mg, once daily. Patient previously took Flu vaccine on Arm was a little sore but that was it, went away in a few days. This was the first time she had ever gotten a flu vaccine on unspecified date in Nov2020 and experienced Arm was a little sore. Patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine last Wednesday. She added she was monitored for 15 minutes post injection but when back to work, at (Retail Company), where she started &#34;itching on the right side of her ankle and leg&#34; and it &#34;was red&#34;. She called the ER that same day who recommended her to take &#34;Benadryl 50mg&#34;, which &#34;helped smooth it over and put [her] to sleep&#34;. She explained she went back to work yesterday, Thursday, and &#34;last night [she] was itching&#34;. She specified applying some &#34;hydrogen cortisone cream which eased it, but it is still itching and red&#34;. She asked if she should take the second dose of the vaccine given her reaction to the first dose. She said she will consult with HCP. She went to orthopedic doctor on 10Jan2021 who gave her a Toradol shot and unknown injection in the knee; she thinks the unknown injection was a steroid or whatever they call it for the pain in her knee because she has bone on bone osteoarthritis. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 03Feb2021. She reported allergic reaction onset after that dose administered on 03Feb2021. She asked if she should still get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 related to this event. Onset same date as vaccine administration. Further described: they let her sit there in the (Facility name) for 15 minutes for monitoring and she had no reaction. She left there and went to work at (Retail Company). She got lunch while at work at (Retail Company) and sat in her truck eating lunch. That is when her right foot started itching right up by her ankle. She went on back into work. She told them she had to leave because she was itching so bad all over, her arms and stuff so she went back home. She also reported pain in the areas itching. She called the (Hospital name) and told the lady she was itching real bad and her ankle was turning red. The lady told her to take Benadryl, so she took 2 Benadryl tablets which helped the itching. After the Benadryl wore off the itching started again. She did not rest at all last night because of this event. She put some Hydrocortisone cream on the area because it is an anti-itch cream; the Hydrocortisone cream soothed it for a while, but then it started right back. She put a cold pack on the area because her daughter thought that might help, but the cold pack did not stop it, it just cooled it down. So she is seeing her Primary Care Physician today for this event. Outcome of the event pain was unknown. Outcome of the other events was not recovered.

Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal. Outcome of the injection site pain was recovered on 01Mar2021, of the difficulty breathing was recovering, of the headache, chills, fever, dizziness, weakness, and felt sick was not recovered, while of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                hives; face swelling; itching; rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 71-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EH9899), intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 11:08 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing depression. Concomitant medication included atenolol (tablet, strength 50 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for blood pressure high, simvastatin (tablet, strength 20 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL, tablet, strength 40 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for depression. The patient experienced hives, face swelling, itching and rash on 27Dec2020. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. She got the first Covid 19 dose on 22Dec2020 and was fine, then on 27Dec2020 she had hives, itching, and face swelling for several days. Caller stated her lungs were clear and she was okay other than the extreme itching. The face swelling was what worried her. The hives and itching went away within about 36 hours. The face swelling kind of got worse for a couple of days before it went away. Caller verifies she recovered from the hives/rash/itching within 36 hours. She got a steroid shot and things like that and it went away pretty quickly. The face swelling was completely gone but did last for a good 5 days. She didn&#39;t know if this reaction was related to the vaccine. She wanted to call and let Pfizer know and see if there was any reports of anything else like that or similar to that type of reaction. She was not sure if that really matters or not except she was not sure about taking the booster. She was kind of leaning towards taking the second vaccine. She didn&#39;t have any breathing issues. She asked as far as the second dose after those side affects, was it recommended? Her doctor said she could get the second one and prescribed her an Epi pen and would give a dose of Benadryl at the time of the second vaccine. She may take some Benadryl before getting the second vaccine and have her EpiPen with her just in case. She hadn&#39;t seen her doctor about this experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She only went to an urgent care. The caller stated she went to urgent care twice. She received a steroid shot but doesn&#39;t have any name, NDC/UPC, Lot number or expiration date for any of the medication she received. She probably threw that paperwork out. She knew she wasn&#39;t given anything the second time she went to the urgent care. The second time she went back was because the face swelling was getting worse. She was prescribed an EpiPen and was told to take Zyrtec which did help. Everything had gone away. She would consider these events to be medically significant because of the face swelling, it kind of scared her. She made the comment she was taking high blood pressure medicine and cholesterol medicine, but other than that she was very healthy. She was not really an allergic person. She had not had any testing done since she received the vaccine. She did have bloodwork done prior but not since the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work prior vaccine with unknown result. The outcome of hives, rash and itching was recovered on an unspecified date of Dec2020 (within about 36 hours); face swelling was recovered on 01Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time gap between the vaccine and the events there is not a reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to the suspect product,  events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 06Jan2021 09:40 at a single dose as COVID vaccine. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications noted as on other medications but nothing new. She previously got the shingle shot for immunization then her arm hurt a few days. She had no other reaction to vaccines in the past. She received no vaccine on the day of or in the prior 4 weeks. Last Wednesday on 06Jan2021, the patient took the vaccine and has had a headache since; even touching her head hurts. She had a persistent headache that started the day after the vaccine and has continued since. The next day on 07Jan2021 was when the headache started. She took regular Motrin (lot OFE3249A, expiry: May2022) and Tylenol extra strength (lot: LMA051, expiry: Jul2019, perhaps not working anymore) sometimes but they didn&#39;t really seem to help. She felt the best when she was standing up or laying down, and she would rather be laying down. She asked &#34;Is this a normal side effect, am I dying? I am not a headache kind of person, I take a Motrin, it goes away and I do not have one for months. It actually hurts to the touch.&#34; Should she be worried? She did call the clinic about the headache and was told if it got serious to go to the emergency room, she didn&#39;t think it was that serious. It was just persistent. She could leave with the pain if it kept her from getting COVID but the fact it was persistent worried her. It was also reported that on 06Jan2021 with this shot her arm really hurt when getting it and that day but that was all (pain in the arm the shot was given), the next night there was no pain. Her and her husband both oooo&#39;d and ahhhh&#39;d with the pain in the arm but that was it (a very uncomfortable pain they experienced in their arm after receiving the injection). She asked how long a side effect lasts after the vaccine? She also stated that on Jan2021, they insist on giving the next dose in 4 weeks. Asked if the vaccine was given a week later would the efficacy be lower? The outcome of persistent headache was not recovered; of vaccination site pain was recovered on 07Jan2021; and of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021036651 same reporter and drug, different patient and AE

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EJ1686, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 11:00 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arm soreness from flu shot 2-3 months ago. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on her left arm on 31Dec2020 as she works with elderly at nursing home and she was of age. Two days after her shot, on 02Jan2021, she experienced little headache which lasted all day but was gone by the following day. On 12Jan2021, 2 days ago, when she woke up and got of bed with severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint which lasted for maybe 10 minutes. It was so severe she could hardly get out of bed. Currently, she had no joint pain. The right shoulder and right hip pain were so odd she thought, but it has also improved since. It&#39;s been 2 weeks and she never had this happen before. This lasted a little while, but thought it was from the cold weather since it&#39;s been 2 weeks since having the vaccine. She still has a bit of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose on an unspecified date. She mentioned this to her supervisor and was encouraged to call and she wants to know if this could be a side effect. The patient had no vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. She had the flu shot before in past and the area would be sore for a few days, but now with this Covid vaccine this arm was still tender. Also, she had gotten the shingles shot the same day as the flu shot but that was about 2-3 months ago, at least 2 months ago. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Covid vaccine. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the first administration. Outcome of event headache was recovered on 03Jan2021; severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint/it was so severe she could hardly get out of bed was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose was not recovered.

Red area in a circle around injection site.   Measures 2.1/4&#34; in diameter.  Went to MD.  He said could be a very delayed reaction or cellulitis..  Said I was the 3rd person in 2 weeks who had come to see him with this type of what he presumed was  a delayed reaction.   Said  he looked at CDC articles and could not find any reference to this type of reaction.  As a precaution I was prescribed Keflex for possible cellulitis. MD said wait it for a few days and take ATB if site gets bigger.  Also mark with a pen on my arm the current size of red area so could determine if it gets larger.  1 day later site was much bigger but slightly less red: now looked like a cloud shape, size now measured 2 1/2 &#34;  by 31/2 &#34; at the largest point.  still hot and red.  I never took the ATB.  Eventually all subsided by today 2-23-21.  Just minimal red area left.

This 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has a question about the COVID-19 vaccine. She stated that she thought she had a simple question, and she called the COVID hotline, and the CDC and they just keep bouncing her around. She said she had her first dose of the vaccine on 16Jan2021, and wasn&#39;t bothered by it, she had just a bit of soreness when she touched her arm (unspecified date in Jan2021), but 10 days later, on 26Jan2021, her arm got red, so she is wondering if this could be a delayed reaction. She stated that she is not having bad effects, she is just wondering why it would pop up after so many days. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Was told it was basically shingles. Her internist was on the fence because she just had the COVID-19 Vaccine and wasn&#39;t certain. Caller stated it was ironic that she broke out after the vaccine. Caller&#39;s internist stated for any rash it would be treated the same with Valtrex. Internist stated chances were the rash was viral so if it&#39;s not shingles, would be treated with Valtrex. Rash and Itching: Wasn&#39;t very bad on Saturday, 23Jan2021, which was the first time she had someone look at it. On Sunday, 24Jan2021 it was full blown and really blossomed. Was initially treating rash as if it was bug bites. Was applying Benadryl tropical. On Sunday, 24Jan2021, started taking Valtrex.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at left arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included low sodium, Covid-19 in Nov2020 (She had felt sick for a week and on 13Nov2020 she went to the ER and they did blood tests and she could not eat or drink for 3 days. She stated that she had 4 different IV fluids going and one of them was sodium and the other was for nausea), blood did not clot properly, broke her back. There were no concomitant medications.The patient had a unique reaction after receiving the Covid-19mRNA Vaccine. She clarified that she never had a reaction to a shot before. She received the vaccine on 31Dec2020 and was fine for the first 20 hours. She said that the next morning on 01Jan2021 at 0600 she woke up cold  and could not get warm. She said that she spent the next 24 hours to where she kept adding clothes and blankets to keep warm. She stated that she was freezing and the she felt like the interior of her body was freezing even down to her toes felt cold. She also had injection site pain and the arm felt heavy and stated that the pain extended from her shoulder down to her elbow. She stated that the injection site pain was kind of delayed. She had aches and pains. She said that some of the pain went from the injection shoulder and spread to the middle of her spine. She had nausea and total loss of appetite and could not even eat. Her aches and pains after the vaccine were similar aches like she had with the Covid. She said that she had a terrible headache when she had Covid though. She stated that after the 24 hours of receiving the vaccine she had a little headache, but she took a migraine pill for it. She said that she was able to shed clothes, but she could not take a shower, but within 24-36 hours she was back to normal like it all never happened. She said that was when she figured out it was like her hemorrhaging with one of her childbirths. She explained that she had 3 children and hemorrhaged with each of her child births and was going into shock with one of them and felt this freezing sensation due to blood loss. She thought that her reaction to the vaccine was so bad that she was either not making blood or there was an interference. There was some kind of weird interruption. She said that her blood clots break down from minutes to hours after her child birth or with dental procedures. She had a PAI-1 deficiency or Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 deficiency. She said that there was also something deeper that her doctors had not figured out yet too. She said that her blood did not clot properly. She said that she did not bruise or anything, but she was not allowed to have internal surgery without a transfusion. She said that her doctor&#39;s started to figure this all out after she broke her back before. She went to a hematologist and had her counts checked regularly. She said that she was being studied by 127 different clinics. She gained 10lbs, but she was very physically active. This was her first dose of teh vaccine. She said that her doctors told her that she needs to be under 48 hours of observation if she gets the second vaccine. Her primary care physician recommended that she did not take another mRNA vaccine. She said that she was taking their advice and canceled her second dose appointment. She said that when she had Covid-19 they did a Chest x-ray on 13Nov2020 and she had low sodium. She said that they gave her tramadol at the hospital for her headache, but she had already taken 3 migraine pills that day. She had already had her flu shot and read somewhere on a website, that mRNA vaccines might cause unstable anticoagulation. She wondered if it could be possible that Covid-19 antibodies interfered with her injection? The outcome of events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 14-JAN-2021 at the 72 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included COPD so sometimes she would cough, kidney stent, rheumatoid (&#34;two&#34; Tylenol and 20 mg prednisone for &#34;her rheumatoid&#34;). The concomitant medication was clarithromycin (MACROBID) from an unspecified date to 12Jan2021. The patient got it on the 14Jan2021. She says she had been doing fine she didn&#39;t know now. She was a retired paramedic so she usually felt things out, she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching on 14Jan2021 but she did not think anything of it. Friday evening she had a good time eating some walnuts and she woke up about 2:30 itching that was Saturday morning before day, she took Benadryl and went back to sleep later then later on she was itching a little again in the palm of her hands and she just took a Benadryl and it went away. Then Sunday night, last night, she was okay so she decided to go to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl, they had no Benadryl and she only had old Benadry. Then about 12:30 she started itching on her bottom, itching on her arms and she was scratching. She noticed she was having some face soreness in Jan2021 but she was using some expired facial cream so she thought that was why her face was sore so she put some hydrocortisone cream on it. Since she was itching she decided to take a little of her nieces Benadryl, it is pediatric Benadryl. She was itching so she called her doctor and she heard him in the ER say they had too many people in there to tell her to go to the ER so she said okay. She hung up and called the pharmacy and they said it sounds like having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she told him she had the COVID vaccine but she doesn&#39;t think she was short of breath and she gave them her vitals her BP was 152/85(BP 157/85) that was high for her in Jan2021, but it came down, she took some Tylenol then it was 146/77, her pulse rate was 77 and her respirations were good she did not have shortness of breath or cough well she has COPD so sometimes she would cough. Then she got up and said let me go one over and get some Benadryl so she went by there got some good Benadryl and she thought she would call and see what they think about all this. She took the Benadryl at 10:25 and she is doing okay right now but she had whelps, she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching in Jan2021, it is on the left side of her hip, the cellulitis part of her skin that is mostly where she is itching in Jan2021. She remembers when she worked at the health department they would give Benadryl and Prednisone. She thought if the Benadryl does not help then she would call, then she decided she would go ahead and call to see what information they have. She says Pfizer is giving her alerts that she has been answering but she did not have the itching at that time. She retired from being a paramedic in 2009. She says she is 72 now but she woke up in 1985 and her lip was swollen like not totally swollen but her top lip was swollen more than the bottom in Jan2021. They gave her an Epinephrine shot and Benadryl and she is just wondering if this itching is related to the vaccine or if it is just an allergy that she may have come up on or something like to the walnuts or something. She says they went there and they gave the shot and they gave Benadryl but they are not sure. She said the doctor never figured our what it was that cause it and it never happened again until she did notice a little puffiness on her lip again this morning. She said the itching first started around 2:34 AM in the morning before light. It had improved since taking up to date Benadryl. She was supposed to get her second dose 04Feb2021. She didn&#39;t want COVID 19. She knew she just came off, she had a kidney stent and she had stopped taking 2 days before, she was taking Macrobid. She was not taking that right now. She took a lot of other medications but the Macrobid she was just on and it was stopped on Tuesday 12Jan2021, 2 days before the vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if the Macrobid would interfere with getting vaccine. The outcome of the event itching was recovering, the other events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of 2 reports.  A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at the right upper arm close to the shoulder on 02Feb2021 07:30 at single dose as she doesn&#39;t want to get COVID again or give COVID to anyone else. Medical history included metabolic syndrome from 1994 and ongoing, it all started when she was 46 and it runs in her family and it was a genetic thing; ongoing diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed when she was 65, so 7 years ago; she had COVID in Nov2020 but it was just a very mild case and she just had a cough; and cardio artery problems. She takes a lot of medications and she has metabolic syndrome which includes cardio artery problems and diabetes, but she has taken all of those medications for a long time. The patient says she was calling to report a couple little concerns she has. She received her shot on Tuesday, 02Feb2021 at about 7:30 in morning and her arm started at about 2 to 3 in the afternoon and she noticed it was getting sore, but it was no big deal, she did not think anything of it, and on the second day she thought that was it and she was over it on 03Feb2021. She states her husband also mentioned that he had soreness in his arm after his vaccination. She says at three in the afternoon on 03Feb2021, she started feeling weak and shaky, but she didn&#39;t think much of that. She says this began around 3 to 4 when yesterday afternoon, 03Feb2021, she had a fever. She says she took her temperature and it was 100.4 and that all kind of was gone by the evening but when she woke up this morning, she was weak and shaky again. Today she got up and was weak and shaky and it never left, she was still weak and shaky. The patient mentions that she was diabetic so she can get weak and shaky when she needs to eat something, but she had just eaten, and she ate yesterday so she doesn&#39;t think it was caused by that. The patient says she thinks we should know that she was diabetic. She says then she could tell that she had a fever, so she took her temperature and it was 100.4 which for her was high. She states she didn&#39;t even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that&#39;s why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years. She says last night she took her temperature again and the fever had gone away in 30 to 40 minutes, so she thought it was over. She took her temperature again before she called this morning, 04Feb2021 and it was 99.2, which was still a little hot for her. She says for her that&#39;s a fever. She was 96 and 97 usually. The patient says she still feels like she has a little fever. She was not someone who usually has a fever and it can be just a little bit of a fever for instance like this morning when she was 99.2. Her eyes were still feeling funny and burning this morning and that was why she took her temperature this morning. The outcome of the event arm was a little sore was recovered on 03Feb2021; feeling weak and shaky was not recovered; fever and her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021162089 Same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9261; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration from 21Jan2021 to 21Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for an unspecified indication. Medical history included &#39;thyroid&#39; from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing at 100 ug, 1x/day for &#39;thyroid&#39;. Patient stated that she spoke with her physician&#39;s assistant. Patient received vaccine on the 21st of January, the first shot at her local place. The following morning at 4 in the morning, patient had severe arm pain where the shot was injected. So patient put a hot compress on it and took some paracetamol (TYLENOL). Patient mentioned that it didn&#39;t relieve for about an hour and a half. Patient meant the pain was really severe but finally it went away. The next day, it came back again and then the patient did it again and the pain keep coming back. Patient stated &#34;And now it&#39;s been tomorrow will be a week. And that&#39;s too long to have muscle pain from my shot&#34;. Patient also mentioned that second day after the shot, migraine headache started. Patient stated, &#34;Now I get them, but I only get them in the spring and I get them in the Fall. I don&#39;t get the migraine headaches in the winter time. I could only take Excedrin Migraine for the migraine, it&#39;s just over the counter medicine. And so I took that for the headache but those have not gone away either. When patient contacted her physician&#39;s assistant just now, it was reported that patient the physician&#39;s assistant is going to write a prescription for a muscle relaxer. Patient also reported that she is not going to take that second shot as she didn&#39;t know where to go to cancel it but she is not taking it. Patient mentioned she can&#39;t have pains like this. Patient stated that she can&#39;t tolerate pain to begin with, let alone have excess pain in her system. Patient added that she doesn&#39;t take medications. She is only on a thyroid medication (later confirmed the name as levothyroxine). Patient confirmed that the vaccine was Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. When probed for the due date of the next shot, patient stated &#39;February 11th at 12 o&#39; clock&#39;. Patient also stated &#39;I am not getting it, I am not taking the second shot. I didn&#39;t get you, I don&#39;t know what you said. I am not understanding you. I am not getting what you are saying. I am not taking the second shot, it is scheduled for February 11th of 2021, I am not taking it. Because they called and asked if I wanted to receive it and my age is almost 73. So, I thought I probably should give it a chance. But now with the reaction I don&#39;t want the second one&#39; and &#39;I don&#39;t know if there is something wrong with this phone or something wrong with the connection, I don&#39;t understand, I get part of it but I don&#39;t understand the other part. It blanks out, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, you are asking me something, but I don&#39;t know what it is&#39;. Patient also reported that the pain started the day after she got the shot, 22Jan2021. Patient is still having pain. Patient also confirmed that TYLENOL was the treatment for pain but it was not working. Medication for migraine was reported as EXCEDRIN migraine. Patient further confirmed EXCEDRIN Migraine did not help with the migraine and stated &#39;No, I still have it, it gives me some relief but then after wears off it comes back, the migraine comes back&#39;. Patient further added &#34;Okay, I am just going to rely on my physician assistant, she has got some medication ordered for me, a muscle relaxer. And I am going to try that and see if that will make everything go away&#34;.  Outcome of the events &#39;severe arm pain where the shot was injected&#39; and &#39;migraine headache&#39; was not recovered; outcome of the remaining event was unknown.

                                                left eye felt tight and felt itchy/severe tightness in her left eye; intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch; severe tightness in her left eye that felt like it was going to swell up; hot skin for several hours; hot flashes; She has itching in ears and throat; Onset of burning and itching; Skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number=EL3249), intramuscular on the right arm, at the age of 72 years, on 13Jan2021 09:45 at a SINGLE  DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included food allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient would like to know if the vaccine was derived from or does it have any products from Acacia. One of the reason&#39;s she was asking was because she knows it has Polyethylene Glycol in it. Her resources are limited. She was a retired healthcare provider and she taught graduate level nursing and has background in epidemiology and public health. The Polyethylene Glycol was in the vaccine, according to the prescribing information. Some forms of Polyethylene Glycol in some type of way are derived from gum acacia and she does not know if this is the case for the COVID vaccine. She did have 1st dose and waited 15 minutes. When her left eye felt tight and felt itchy, she took 2 Benadryl and then waited in car a little longer. She felt like she was going to go into what she has had in past 3-4 times relating to fish. She has had full blown facial swelling, intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch. Those times, if she had chopsticks, she would want to scratch inside her ear. She never had that with the COVID vaccine. They told her when she got the vaccine that if this develops further, she should go to her doctor or ER, but should not come back there. She did not want to go to the ER and sit there for 12 hours waiting to see if she was going to have a worse reaction, so she went home, took 2 more Benadryl, and went to bed. Eight hours later, she was fine and did not have hives. She then stated she completed report with Pfizer online and did not have a reference number for previous report. For those time when she had these episodes with the fish, she had extreme itching and hives. The worst allergy she had, her fingers looked like they were webbed. She was treated with Adrenaline, Cortisone and Benadryl by injection and that would usually stop the reaction, but it usually takes 3-4 days for the swelling to go down. In later years, if there is a piece of fish mixed in with fried shrimp and she inadvertently eats it, she knows it immediately. She will take Benadryl immediately. She will have facial swelling and swelling around her eyes. The Benadryl will contain it. She will be disfigured for 2 weeks, with bags of fluid in her cheeks. She is going for her second shot tomorrow. She can self treat with Benadryl. In 1994, she had a very positive wheels from an intradermal scratch testing for Acacia and codfish. The patient had an onset of burning and itching, periorbital. She took 2 25 mg Benadryl tablets. She has itching in ears and throat. After my 15 minutes waiting, she left. She had various hot spots of burning skin, legs and arms. Left eye felt like past episodes of itching, about to swell. Her skin had feeling of about to break out in hives. Facility said to go to provider or ER if got worse. She chose not to go to ER, and wait and be miserable for hours on end, while waiting for full blown body hives all over. She took two more 25 mg Benadryl and went to bed. She had intermittent burning skin, various areas, for several hours. About 8 hours later, was resolved. The patient was about to receive 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine. After the 1st dose she experienced an itchy feeling in throat, rotating heat in arms and legs, slight bag fluid under left eye and it felt to her like she was going to have an allergic reaction but did not. She took some Benadryl and after 8 hours she was fine. The patient stated after the first dose of the vaccine she had itching, severe tightness in her left eye that felt like it was going to swell up, and hot skin for several hours. She took two Benadryl while she was still in the waiting period and perhaps that blunted the reaction. She had hot flashes on the drive home. She took two more Benadryl at her daughter house (100mg total after taking 4 that day). She didn&#39;t feel good and felt she was on the verge of getting hives. She had episodes of hot skin and itching and after 8 hours it was over and done with and she was fine. She stated she is nervous about the second dose but stated they have what they need if she has an immediate reaction and it is worth the risk of getting vaccinated.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of left eye felt tight and felt itchy/severe tightness in her left eye (eye pruritus), intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch (ear pruritus), onset of burning and itching (skin burning sensation), skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over (urticaria). The outcome of the event onset of burning and itching and skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over was recovered on an unspecified date while other events were unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9262, expiration date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at left upper arm around 19:00 or a little later at single dose (at the age of 72-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included bad knees and got injections for this and recurrent cellulitis of legs (cellulitis was not active at time of vaccine; but anytime her leg swells with bad knees she had a little episode with the cellulitis down around her ankles on both legs but left leg was more predominant. She had been keeping it at bay), mineral supplementation, bad knee pain, blood pressure medication (abnormal), urine output control (abnormal), dehydrated and dizzy. Concomitant medication included lisinopril as blood pressure medication, potassium for Mineral supplement, solifenacin succinate for urine output control, paracetamol (TYLENOL 4) for bad knee pain. She had taken potassium before and it calmed it down: she was little dehydrated, little dizzy, so was drinking some Pedialyte, water, and taking potassium. The patient had it once before but it kind of snuck up on her again. The patient called to ask if anyone had reported any type of blood clot on the same side of the body that the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. She questioned if she might have a blood clot in her left leg after having been administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She had recurrent cellulitis in both legs prior to Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The doctor thought the cellulitis in left leg may be acting up and that she might have an infection in that area of cellulitis. She reported pain in the left leg when she rested her leg on a pillow; but did not feel any pain when she was standing and walking. The pain became a little too hard for her to bear so the doctor prescribed her Cephalexin 500m capsule every 12 hours-she was on the 3rd capsule now. Onset date for the events was approximately 03Feb2021 or 04Feb2021. The events were better since started Cephalexin. Second dose date scheduled for 22Feb2021 but did not give her time. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Follow-up (23Feb2021): New information received from the product quality complaint group includes confirmation of lot number (EL9262) and new expiry date.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed 15 years ago, maybe; High cholesterol diagnosed 20 years ago, she doesn&#39;t know, reflux diagnosed 20 years ago, maybe more, prediabetes and allergy induced asthma which she carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year. Patient reported that she was tested and they don&#39;t know for sure, but she reported that she may have allergy induced asthma as she has to take, carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year, in the fall when leaves are falling down, the leaves get moldy, and she was driving in her car, or walking in a wooded area, she gets tightness, takes her inhaler and was fine, that&#39;s the extent, no other circumstances; fall or she had where a plant was blooming outdoors, she gets tightness, and she took her inhaler, and was good for the next year, so sitting in the environment and nothing further materializes, if she takes the inhaler three or two times a year, considering what other people have, she thought this was insignificant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she got vaccinated this Friday and had nothing but a sore arm afterwards, on 16Jan2021 and was fine all day, evening, all day Saturday. She just had soreness at the site, she had no redness at the site of injection, but the weird part: she doesn&#39;t think anyone would believe, 33 hours later, at midnight, she was still up, on her way to bed, and all of a sudden she experienced extremely excruciating stabbing pains in her arm with the shot, it was stabbing, excruciating, and immediately at the same time, she had shivers/shivered and had a splitting headache, was freezing and had to put socks on, and had noticed very slight difficulty breathing, and since it was midnight, she didn&#39;t want to wake up her husband, she dozed off, and was up at 0530. She had body aches, slight, it was the least, but the stabbing stopped in her arm. She slept from 12:30 to 05:30, and the shivering and aches stopped, but the headache was still on, so she took a pill for the headache. She took the thermometer that marked 100F orally; she stated that the fever was higher in the night and she assumed with the shivering, she had a greater fever than 100. Also, the oximeter indicated 133 pulse and 86 of oxygen saturation. By 10:00, it all had resolved. She has an oximeter, and since she still had the feeling of difficulty breathing, she put it on, but her pulse was 133, that was when she was feeling better. It was reported that all symptoms were gone except for rapid pulse, it was 133 and the slight breathing, and her 02 saturation was anywhere between 86-88, it varied, and by 10:00, all issues resolved, her heartbeat was down to normal, her breathing was above 94, or whatever, everything was fine, and has been fine since then. Maybe she had fatigue on Saturday and Sunday, on Sunday was like after the flu, after you finish, you have fatigue and was a little out of it, this was on Sunday. On an unspecified date, the patient stated that she was shrinking and weight varies. Patient stated that the only thing she does have, says she has a cough, but because she needs a drink, she was not sick and she gets to drink water. She felt like the reaction she had was in the limit of a severe allergic reaction due to the rapid heartbeat and her difficulty breathing. She would like to know if there was information about these side effects reported so she can determine if she was going to have the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of events states she was shrinking, weight varies and cough was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was recovered on an unspecified date.

It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

Morning after chills, neck stiffness, pain back of head left side. Applied heating pad to neck. By late morning I was nauseous , and weak as a kitten. Took a 500 mg Tylenol and slept for about 4 hours. Woke up in a sweat but chills gone and am now able to eat a little bit. Back of head and neck still very sore.   The injection site is sore but no rash; right arm seems to have &#34;phantom pain&#34; as well ( I experienced this with Shingles shot in December 2020 too).

Her arm is sore.

A 74-year-old female patient received her second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot EL3248, expiration Apr2021) at 6:00AM on 07Jan2021 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had her first dose on 19Dec2020 and had side effects from it but very few. The patient was worked at COVID rooms to clean rooms in hospital as a housekeeper and so her exposer to the hospital made her in first group to get the vaccine. Medical history included allergies (had anaphylactic shock from Amoxicillin and from Tylenol, she cannot take Tylenol), anxiety, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) on regular basis, bisoprolol fumarate, loratadine (CLARITIN) for allergies, escitalopram for anxiety, mometasone furoate (FLONASE) for allergies, losartan, magnesium, omeprazole, and triamterene. On the first day (07Jan2021) she had soreness more than usual from the shot, soreness in her arm, her neck. She got stiff neck, back, lower back. She had gotten the shot at 6 am, then worked at that time and by the time she got home at noon, she had massive weakness, some confusion, terrible sleepiness and by evening, she developed diarrhea. On the second day (08Jan2021) the pain increased the weakness increased, and she was running a temperature of 102. She could not even sit on the side of bed without falling to one side or the other or falling backwards so very weak and unable to move pretty much. She could not eat and lost appetite, and she developed the chills on that evening. On the third day (09Jan2021) she was running a temperature of 101 so it had gone down. She still had headaches, and pain around her face, her left arm and developed severe itching from head to toe, and on the next day (10Jan2021) she developed hives on her face, on her head, on top of her back and they also itch in addition to the all over itching. The temperature was gone, she had no temperature when she developed the hives. At the report day, she stated that she had not gone back to work as she broke out in the horrible hives and she still did not feel good. Only cold ice packs on the hives/ itching and no more treatment received for the events. The fever and itching resolved on 10Jan2021, and outcome of all other events was unknown.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccine (because she&#39;s 74 and high risk). Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included irbesartan oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date (maybe 3 years ago) and ongoing at 300 mg once daily (150mg, 2 tablets once a day in the morning) for hypertension as blood pressure medication. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on Monday (11Jan2021) morning (AM) at 10 at the county (public) health department. She had no problem at all until yesterday Tuesday, she experienced mild swelling; the swelling happened in the upper left arm (swelling of left arm) which started on 12Jan2021, this was also the same side that she got her vaccine on, the left arm. On 13Jan2021 she woke up at 4AM [also reported as thirty (30) hours after the shot] in which she started to have severe chills (horrendous chills), could not get warm under the blanket for an hour and a half. It lasted a long time. Her severe chills did stop, she used an electric (heated) blanket. This morning on 13Jan2021 at 8:30, she woke up with the fever, which she was able to reduce with acetaminophen (did take two acetaminophen). Her fever was also gone. She was a little concerned because she thought her breathing was deep too on 13Jan2021. She did some relaxing breathing which helped. It lasted a long time. The patient also experienced a drop in blood pressure on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running the past few days at 133/80 on 11Jan2021. Today (13Jan2021), she took her blood pressure and it was at 93/50. It went to 87/56 after drinking some salty soup on 13Jan2021 (the bottom number in the blood pressure was going up a little, and the top number was going down a little). Her blood pressure has been normal 133/70 on Jan2021, but this morning it was 90/50 on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running normal the last couple of days like 133/90 on Jan2021. She was shocked it was lower. She knew they talk about dizziness and weakness, but she didn&#39;t experience that. She was concerned about that sudden drop in blood pressure. She did some research and started eating some salty soup and stuff (has been drinking salty soup). Her bottom number went up to 53 on Jan2021. She was concerned about that drop there. She was wondering if that was a side effect of the vaccine (result of the vaccine). She asked if drop in blood pressure was a concern. She had no positive test for Covid before the vaccine. She never had any tested, she&#39;s been pretty isolated. She had no antibody test. She has had no issues with vaccine in the past. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe chills/could not get warm, fever, her breathing was deep, and drop in blood pressure. The outcome of swelling of left arm/mild swelling and drop in blood pressure was not recovered; of severe chills/could not get warm was recovered on 13Jan2021 05:30 and fever was recovered on 13Jan2021; and of her breathing was deep was recovering.

However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

I was anxious as I have anxiety disorder! But my face was RED and TIRED looking. I asked staff what wrong. No swelling at that time! 4:40 PM.  That nite, my heart started POUNDING HARD all night, not stop. Ativan not help. I slept, weird dreams, wake up and still heart pounding.  8 am --- got up and hands, arms, extremities SWOLLEN!! Heart still pounding,  Felt like allergic to MSG or nitrates or preservatives or too much salt. Felt weird.. Not faint-- just weird. Tired from the pounding heart. Not fatigued.  I did have sore arm, but it was NOT an issue.  My hands, toes were red.

They looked at the hives, and told me it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave me Benadryl. They also gave me the number to VAERS to make a report.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do.

                                                Patient presented on 1/24 with acute onset weakness and numbness of the left leg so a stroke alert was activated. NIHSS 3. Head Ct and CTA head/neck were unremarkable. Not a candidate for tPA given on Eliquis. Initial exam was notable for weakness and sensory loss in the left leg, but a sensory level was also found to the umbilicus raising concern for a myelitis. Of note, the patient also reported that certain red colored things she looked at appeared black. Labs unrevealing- CBC, CMP unremarkable. ESR, CRP normal. UA and UCx positive for E. Coli UTI, she was treated with ceftriaxone. MRIs were done of her brain, cervical and thoracic spine which were unrevealing. On 1/25, her exam worsened including worsening weakness in the left leg and new numbness and paresthesias in the right leg. Reflexes were preserved. MRI L spine was done which was unrevealing. Lumbar puncture was done which showed 2 nucleated cells and mildly elevated protein at 50, but was otherwise unrevealing. IgG Index normal. No oligoclonal bands. She developed mild hyperreflexia in the left leg and continued to have a sensory level, now at around T5-6. Repeat imaging of her cervical and thoracic spine were completed on 1/28 which showed a contrast enhancing hyperintensity at T5. The patient was diagnosed with myelitis and she was started on IV methylprednisolone x5 days and sent to rehab. Patient is now significantly improved though continues to report some numbness in the left leg.

About 11:30 I got a bottle of water.  No relief after drinking 8 ounces.  I left the service, went outside, removed my mask and was coughing forcibly for about 15 minutes or so.  Expectorated clear phlegm 6 - 8 times.  Gradually I settled to normal.  Just some residual soreness in throat.  This was an unusual occurrence for me.   I was covid positive in early Dec, but had a very mild case. Back in the 70&#39;s I would have reaction to allergy shots.  I waited in the office 15 minutes, but 45 minutes later when I arrived home I had huge hives and severe itching.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Feb2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 75-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included reverse total shoulder replacement on 26Jan2021, cardiomyopathy from an unknown date, and type 2 diabetes mellitus from an unknown date.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received her shingles shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and flu shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both in Oct2020 for immunization and had no reactions.  On 05Feb2021 at 16:00, the patient experienced hives and itching. On 05Feb2020, the patient had blotches, blistering, swollen hands, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands. The clinical course was as follows: She had absolutely no problem at the time of the injection, no soreness with it she was fine and then she had welts starting with 2-3 then all over her body, that were itching terribly. They stared on the left wrist, both hands. The patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL); but it did not help. The patient then went to the emergency room (ER). By the time she got to the ER, the hives moved up to her abdomen and she was covered in big blistery looking raisings and few small raises on her trunk and arms. The hives were concentrated from her fingers to her elbow, and then there were other blotches on her elbows to her fingers that were real concentrated. She stayed at the hospital for 3 hours, but she was not admitted. At the ER, she received pantoprazole (PROTONIX), diphenhydramine hydrochloride, hydroxyzine (ATARAX) and prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient also stated that her hands were so swollen after getting the dose of the vaccine that she couldn&#39;t get them closed and she had cracking creases with serous fluid coming out of both hands. The swelling went down a little bit the next day; but she still had the blotches. She said the itch was tolerated. However, the blistering started again. Her doctor put her on a sliding scale of prednisone and diphenhydramine at 25 mg every 6 hours. The clinical outcome of the swelling hands was recovering; while that of the blotches and blisters were not recovered. The clinical outcomes of the hives, itching, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands were unknown. The patient assessed the events to be medically significant as she had never experienced anything like this.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

This 75-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318, expiration date: May2021) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 01Feb2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hear disorder, sulfa allergy, allergic to iodine, being shrinking she was 5&#39;4&#34; the last time she looked at it but she has shrunk, she was not sure but she thought she was currently shorter than 5&#39;4&#34;. The patient would like to know if it has sulfa and iodine in BNT162B2. Concomitant medications included insulin, blood pressure medication and heart medication. The patient received first dose of vaccine and experienced a rash and itching on 02Feb2021. The patient was broke out, she had a rash since she had the shot, it was like there were ants all over her back, head, legs, under her breast and under her arms in between legs. The doctor gave her Hydroxyzine for the itch and she just wanted to know, she was leery of going to get the second dose, she wanted to know was the second dose going to make it worse. The patient was scheduled to go for the second one 22Feb2021. She said the first day she got it she was fine, there was nothing, she was waiting for something to happen then she started with the rash. She was taking her blood pressure medication and insulin but she noticed that on the inside of her, on the top of the head was itching, it was the next day, and then toward the evening under her arms were itching and then between her legs and ankles and it was her right arm that she got the shot in and it started blotching. She showed it to the nurse at the office and she told the nurse maybe she was getting Ebola. She had blotches on her arm, it was only the arm she got the shot in. She still had the blotches she still had quite a few. She can still see them but they were getting lighter. Under her breast was still bugging her. She confirmed the itching and rash began the next day, after the first vaccine dose. It had improved since her doctor gave the pills to stop the itching. She was able to sleep, before she couldn&#39;t sleep she had to get up and take showers but since he had given the medicine it was improved and she had used salve, it was Cortisone but her under the bra it still itched where it was pressuring. She was going to have a labs taken to see if there was anything different. She took insulin and heart medication since forever and she even stopped to see, she said it was probably a bad thing but she stopped taking her heart medication to see if it was interacting, she stopped taking her insulin and her heart rate went up, everything was still the same, now she went back and started taking the insulin and heart medication again. Outcome of the event maybe she is getting Ebola was unknown, of the other events was recovering.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 75-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 (age at the time of vaccination was 75-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, osteoporosis and overactive bladder. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The previously had first dose (first shot) of BNT162B2 for covid-19 immunisation and had sore arm. It was reported that she is getting red bumps today (on 07Feb2021) on the part where she got injected. The consumer stated after second shot also, I had no symptoms except for sore arm on an unspecified date in Feb2021. The only thing that I noticed which was from second shot and which was really crazy is, once in a while I get this pain in my pointer finger in my right hand and that was it, it comes and it goes. But today, and in the last couple of days I noticed a little weakness in my right leg, but today when I went to work somebody said what is that big red bump on your forehead and I looked and there was a big red circle, there was a bump, like a real bump on my forehead. I didn&#39;t hide it, I didn&#39;t even think if it was allergic as I only had a banana before I went to work and a cup of coffee which I have lot of time. I am wondering if this bump that I have on my forehead which looks ridiculous and it is a big red bump, like a tumor bump, it feels like kind of sore when I touch it, is from the vaccine because I haven&#39;t had anything but the vaccine.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Main thing I am concerned about is the big red bump on my forehead.&#34; Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;I never had that before, it is very slight. The main thing was the bump on my head that came today and I didn&#39;t have it when I left the house. I didn&#39;t hit my head or anything. I just took two Tylenol and an allergy pill in case if it was some kind of allergy.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
