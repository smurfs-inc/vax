                                                Pt received the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine on Sunday 1/17/21 and developed a sore arm, but otherwise had no symptoms. By Tuesday 1/19/21, he was having shooting pains through his shoulder and down to his elbow. By late Wednesday, he had started to develop hives on his palm, between his fingers, and up to the elbow. Pt states he has a history of a pinched nerve in his neck and elbow, but this pain is nothing like his usual pain.  On 1/22, pt presented to the ED for left uper arm pain and rash. He denied new detergents, foods, clothes, wooded area exposure. Denied decreased ROM in shoulder, but ROM makes his shoulder sore. BP 161/82, otherwise vitals normal. Rash did not apear infectious. No evidence for DVT. Pt received ketorolac 30 mg IM x 1 in ED and was prescribed hydrocodone-APAP 5-325 mg tabs PO Q6h PRN #8. Pt was instructed to follow up with PCP in 1-2 days.  By 1/25/21, pt reports the hives have become dark purple, like bruises. He states he has trouble making a fist and is not using his left arm at all - when this writer spoke to him, he said it was &#34;gimpy.&#34; Pt stated during the phone call that he was about to call his PCP for a follow up appointment.

Patient went to to see a doctor on 2/17 and the doctor prescribed hydroxyzine and a cream to help with the hives, which helped lessen the symptoms but was unable to rule out that the reaction was caused by the vaccine. The doctor recommended that the patient still receives the 2nd dose of the vaccine.

                                                Mild symtoms. About 25 minutes after receiving injection felt slight inflammation on both cheeks near the nose, also notice splotchiness on cheeks. In addition felt slight itch on inside of both elbows which presented a couple hive-like bumps not previously there.  These symptoms continued for about 15 minutes and then began disappearing by the time I reached home. After 45 minutes all adverse reactions were no longer present. No adverse reactions occurred following this except for a sore left arm at injection site.  Arm soreness was abating by 9pm on same date and pretty much gone by next morning.  No additional medication was taken for for any of the reactions. A cool compress was used on the left arm.

Increase of pedal edema from Trace/1&#43; to 2-3&#43;. Unexplained breaking of all finger nails. No pain or itching (pruritus) associated with bruises. No new meds (Rx or OTC) started during the week prior to first injection to this day. No real symptoms to treat so nothing done. Areas of bruising hace increased but are now starting to fade. No specific treatments done as there was nothing to be done other than to consult my PCP.

For MG, I&#39;ve long only needed to take CellCept to be symptom-free. The Pfizer shot IS to blame for the MG exacerbation

After the pfizer vaccine was administered into the left arm deltoid muscle, the surrounding tissue immediately began to swell and form a raised and hardened lump about one inch in diameter.  The lump was about 3 degrees warmer than the surrounding tissue. The patient was instructed  wait in the observation area for 30 minutes, and inform his physician.

                                                On March 30th, the first skin rash / bump appeared on my right wrist and was very itchy. It expanded to an area about 1 inch x 2 inches and a week later continues to be itchy. Zyrtec helps reduce the itching (I only take 1/8 of a pill because a whole pill is too strong for me) On April 4, three additional spots about  1/2 inch in diameter appeared on and around my right nipple. Later that day, three other spots about 1/2 inch in diameter appeared on my LEFT shoulder. I got the short in my right arm. The chest and shoulder spots are only slightly itchy. I took pictures - hopefully later in this interview, I will be able to upload them.

Some smaller patches on mid to lower back.  Rash was active still at the time of second injection (4/2/21, same location, Lot EN6208).  As of today, rash still itchy and irritating, but not increasing in intensity.  Scratching produces tearing of loose skin and bleeding.

                                                I ran a low grade fever (100.1)  for approximately one week. I had body aches (separate from the sore injection site for a single day starting 3/20/2021) and some headaches, but no life-threatening issues, nor enough reason to seek professional medical treatment. After the contiguous week was over, I had similar off and on symptoms for the following week, but these symptoms lessened with time.

                                                Patient reported the start of a itching hive-like rash on Tuesday night after receiving his Covid vaccine on 4/17/2021. He reports the rash continued to get worse, which prompted him to be seen by me in urgent care on 4/22/2021.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 4/17/2021.  No obvious anaphylaxis.  He had a uticarial rash on bilateral arms and knees.  He was tachycardic.  He refused ED visit, so I treated with 50 mg of prednisone for 5 days, oral Benadryl 50 mg every 6 hours, Pepcid 10 mg over-the-counter.  He reported he would refuse to fill out an adverse event via Vsafe app, which prompted me to file this report.

I have been taking Benadryl and applying hydrocortisone to treat the itching.

                                                Per triage notes on 4/21/21: Pt had his 2nd COVID vaccine today at 0800. At 0900 developed lip swelling. Took two doses of Benadryl and has now developed chest tightness and throat swelling. Per doctor&#39;s notes: Patient is a very pleasant 60-year-old gentleman who comes in for evaluation after a possible allergic reaction today, possibly related to a second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine that he got at 8 AM this morning.  About an hour later he started to feel flushed.  He felt like his face was warm and his ears were warm.  He started to feel like the inside of his mouth had filled with a rubber ball.  His tongue felt full and he started noticed progressively that he felt like he was having difficulty swallowing.  States that he never actually had any lip swelling, contrary to the triage note, just felt funny in the interior of his mouth.  Did feel like his tongue was slightly swollen, both based on the fact that it felt &#34;thick&#34; when he was talking, and on direct inspection, as well.  Took 50 mg of Benadryl around the time that his symptoms started, and lay down to nap for a little while.  When he woke up he was still feeling like he was having more difficulty swallowing.  He also felt like his face was a little bit puffy, prickly under each eye.  He also felt like he had a blotchy rash on his chest and upper back, which his wife corroborates.  He felt like his chest was a little bit tight and that something was heavy on his chest, though he was not wheezing or acutely short of breath, per se.  Took another 50 mg of Benadryl at about 2:15 PM, and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation.  Currently still has a little bit of chest tightness and throat tightness.  He feels flushed.  Symptoms have not worsened, but they have not completely resolved, either.  He has had anaphylaxis in the past and has had to be admitted to the hospital.  And this was in relation to taking doxycycline, it sounds like. Patient presented again to the ED on 4/22/21 with the same symptoms. He was admitted with anaphylaxis. Per ED notes, also diagnosed with Angioedema, improved. Likely related to second covid vaccine. Cant rule out secondary to Lisinopril.

Within approximately 4 hours the rash had spread across my chest, up my neck to the chin, around my waist and up the center of my back, and down the insides of my arms.  The rash remained inflamed and red, and the skin sensitive, for approximately 72 hours before it began to fade.  Within 5 days of beginning, the rash had subsided completely.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at the hospital. The patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) on 22Dec2020. Relevant medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes; both were diagnosed in 2006 and ongoing conditions and were under control. Concomitant medications included metformin, lisinopril for high blood pressure, and semaglutide (OZEMPIC, injection), which was a once a week injection kind of like &#34;Trulicity&#34; that encourages his body to make more insulin. The patient said that when he got the second dose of the vaccine on 12Jan2021, he got an achy arm and it went away. At the time of the report on 18Jan2021, almost a week later, he felt like he got the vaccine in his arm again and it was going into his shoulder. The patient was asking if it was normal. He was driving at the time of the call. The patient had been a scrub technician (tech) and an endoscopy tech for 20 years. During the first surge, when they shut down the outpatient surgeries, he went and worked as an aide in the COVID ward. He was glad to get the shot. He did what his kids would do when they were young and would get a shot. He took ibuprofen. Later that evening for the achy arm, he took more ibuprofen. The achy arm lasted only a day. He thought he wasn&#39;t going to have any side effects at all. It felt like a flu shot. The patient clarified that at the time of the report (18Jan2021), his arm felt achy like it was the day he got the shot and the day after. He got the vaccine as he was in the first bunch in the city and he works in healthcare and the fact that he was over 60 years old. The patient stated he could live through it and he was just curious. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The events did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. The patient had no relevant tests. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of achy arm, which included ibuprofen. The patient recovered from the event &#34;achy arm&#34; on 13Jan2021, while the outcome of the event &#34;felt like he got the vaccine in his arm again and it was going into his shoulder/ arm felt achy like it was the day he got the shot and the day after&#34; was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

All other joints and areas in which I have minor aches and pains were very sore.   Mind somewhat clouded.  Modest temperature, 101. Chills.  Like a bad flu, but more pain and less congestion. Strong but not splitting headache. Not like a migraine--not at all as bad.  Very minor nose congestion and sore throat.  Symptoms all ended by 36 hours after 2nd shot

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded.

                                                About two weeks after the 1st shot I noticed my facial skin was very itchy.  This was a constant thing.  Two days after I had the shot shot my face swoll up and was very itchy.  I was waking up in the middle of the night several times a night because of the itches and I was going my best no to scratch.  i rubbed moisturizer in to my face and later started using some over the counter itching creams that would work for a few hours.  I began to realize the itching was worse in places where I had five years ago had Bellafill infected into acne scars and deep wrinkles by a licensed cosmetic surgeon.  I like the results and have no issue with the doctor or filler, but this stuff itched terribly.  I see on the internet some complaints from others, but I wanted to report that I too have this.  As of today, weeks later, it is not as bad, but as I write this I want to itch a place above my right cheek bone that was injected with Bellafill.   I thought it was a problem with the Bellafill, I am convinced now it is a side effect of the vaccine.  Guess this means it is working to adopt to odd things in my body.

As I have been working in Asia, I have had several vaccines in my life and in recent years. Never a reaction like this.

It looks like a giant bruise or almost like bleeding under the skin. Dark round circles.   No pain, swelling, itchiness, or fluid. No pain on applying pressure to it. Was worried it was a blood clot but we think it is associated with receiving the vaccine as it is only in the left forearm. Patient states that it is &#34;clearing up&#34;.

A 61-year-old-male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 (received at 61-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis, overactive immune system, unspecified mental health issues, and ongoing muscle pain. Concomitant medications were unspecified; the patient stated that he is on 4 vials of different medicine, or maybe 5. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number was not reported), on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that he had the Covid-19 vaccine. He reported that he was given a handout sheet that he read after he had the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. It was highlighted in yellow that he shouldn&#39;t have taken the Covid-19 vaccine with an overactive immune system. He further reported that the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is affecting his mental health. His mental health started being affected about 7-8 days after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He stated that he is getting blistering, wet rashes on his legs again. He would like to see what he can do about this, but he will have to do it by mail. He reported that he has to get pictures taken of himself. He has an appointment tomorrow where he got the Covid-19 vaccine. He stated that he also has to go back to the dermatologist that is taking care of his immune system. He reported that he has lost a lot of weight. He reported that his weight is 147 pounds or maybe 141 pounds. He has lost a lot of weight since receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. He was given an emergency authorization release after he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He noticed that he wasn&#39;t feeling good right away after getting the Covid-19 vaccine. When his legs started getting a rash and then blisters, his medical provider took pictures. The rash and blisters are affecting his feet too. The rash on his legs appears about 7-8 days after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 09Mar2021. He reported that what is on his legs started as rash and then turned into blisters. The blisters popped and it&#39;s like poison comes out. The fluid from the blisters smells, and that the fluid is ruining his clothes and is going to ruin shoes. The rash got worse the other day, with blisters forming.  The blisters have now popped and there&#39;s going to be scars. The patient reported that he now has open wounds on his legs that bleed from the popped blisters. He also reported that it felt like all of his arthritis and muscles were affected. He took something for muscle spasms and arthritis, a muscle relaxant, for his back. Everything hit about the same time, 7-8 days after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine on 09Mar2021. The muscle pain has been going on for a while, but it got worse after the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient also experienced joint problems, fever, feeling unwell on an unspecified date, had to overuse inhaler, couldn&#39;t think on an unspecified date. Outcome of affecting his mental health was recovering. Outcome of blistering, wet rashes on legs, muscle pain has been going on for a while, but it got worse after the Covid-19 vaccine was not recovered. Outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The swelling was well past the band-aid to the point of taking off the band-aid to relieve pressure. Four hours after the vaccination I had begun to have pain in my left shoulder when trying to use my left arm/hand. This pain in my arm is still very high after 5 weeks. The pain is actually worse as I cannot play golf with extra pain in my back swing.

                                                Sharp pain at the injection site; This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 61-year-old male consumer (patient) reported for himself that he received second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0172) via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06May2021 13:30 (age at vaccination was 61 years) as 2nd dose single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, cholesterol and allergic to dogs, cats, horses, ragweed from unspecified dates. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes hydrochlorothiazide 25mg, amlodipine besilate 10mg, lisinopril 40mg for blood pressure, rosuvastatin 10mg for cholesterol on unspecified dates. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0150) dose 1 via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Apr2021 13:30 as 1 dose single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On unspecified date, it was reported that, the patient had the first dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 14Apr2021 and had the second dose on 06May2021, more than 21 days later. After the first dose he had a sore arm, and after the second dose he still has sharp pain at the injection site a month later. Patient comes on the line. He had the first shot and had no reaction whatsoever, not even any pain in his arm until a week and a half or 2 weeks later and it was minor pain. After the second shot he had no allergic reaction and no problems. He got the second dose on 06May2021. Within the last 2 weeks or so every time he moves his arm a certain way, he has a sharp pain in the injection site. Normally there is some soreness that goes away, he is surprised to still have this. He didn&#39;t call his doctor because it is too new and they won&#39;t know. Second dose sharp pain in the injection site, After the second shot he has the same thing after a month now. Right now, he can extend his arm out. It probably started right after he got the vaccine, but the sharp pain now is what bugs him. He can stand here now and extend his arm out and bend his elbow up and feel a little bit of pain, but nothing major. Every once in a while, it will turn into a sharp pain and he will move a certain way and have sharp pain. It has gotten worse over time. He thought it was something that would fade away over time. He can stand and move his arm every which direction, but he will be doing some work around the house and suddenly have a sharp pain. He can&#39;t duplicate the pain right now. The question he is posing is if this is something that is being reported and if it is a concern or not a concern. He realizes it is all new, and that is why he is posing the question. He asks if this is expected or out of the ordinary. The patient&#39;s lab test include blood work two weeks after the shot, but it was nothing for his arm. The clinical outcome of the event was reported as not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

A 62-year-old male patient received NT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL01-40), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Dec2020 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

For Causality assessment: Physician stated, &#34;he didn&#39;t know, he was just trying to find out to get to bottom of it. Is it really COVID infection or is it due to side effects as from what he read the reaction shouldn&#39;t really last long. It may last probably 3-4 days but this has gone beyond that so he was little concerned and the fever that he had was 7 days after the vaccine.&#34; The patient still had chills and body ache which he means they were not going away and now mild fever. When probed for the outcome of, Physician stated, &#34;They are persistent you know some day he had one day which was good but after that in the afternoon in the evening he felt the same thing. Fortunately, he was off for four days it didn&#39;t really have much problem, physically it was persistent has not gone away.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, had mild body ache, felt a little sick, cough, fever, mild sore throat.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;.

A 62-year-old male patient started to receive single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization; and adalimumab (HUMIRA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose (injection every other month) for arthritis. Medical history included arthritis, blood pressure (abnormal), and blood cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol, olmesartan medoxomil, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL XL), and vitamins: ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride. Patient stated, &#34;The reason I am calling, I have just a concern that something happened to me. I did not pay much attention but now I have read the news one doctor died after getting this COVID Vaccine (Further details were not available over the call) I have a small incident happened to me the day after I received my first dose of the COVID Vaccine. I just wanted to get some information. You know what happened the next day night, in the evening I was taking a shower and all of sudden I was bleeding from somewhere. Lot of blood was coming out while I was toweling my body out. I couldn&#39;t find out where the blood is coming from. I checked, it&#39;s not from my urine, not from my rectum but it was quite a lot of blood drawing out of my body. Immediately, I called my wife into bathroom, then I squeezed my body then the bleeding stops. It was on 24Dec2020. You know my kids were at home. I don&#39;t want them to find it. The bleeding stopped and everything went away. Then I thought maybe it is something related to my GI. I went to my GI doctor yesterday to have a checkup, they don&#39;t know anything either but I am due for my second dose for next week Wednesday. Now I had this news about thrombocytopenia on this doctor died (Clarification unknown). So I am just afraid if there is anything related this. Do you have any explanation on how I bleed and where it bleed? It was lot of bleeding even my towel was full of blood.&#34; Patient wanted to see if anybody else had similar experience or if he get the second dose and he get the complication again. Patient was a medical technologist. He was doing ultrasounds. He was working in a pediatric hospital. Patient was not prescribed/recommended vaccination. &#34;Nobody recommended it. During my hospital. I am healthcare professional. So everybody in my hospital. I just went there and get it. I didn&#39;t ask my doctor.&#34; Patient added, &#34;You know everything I read about this case and then you know, I have a cut in my leg which is very unusual. I have never seen that. I don&#39;t know how it happened. You know all of sudden oneday I wake up and I saw a big cut in my feet also. So, I am just afraid (onset date not reported).&#34; The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

I took some ibuprofen for the headache.  Prior to the vaccination I have not been ill.

A contactable consumer reported for himself, a 62-year-old male patient who received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as by injection) to left arm on 14Jan2021 at 3pm at single dose to prevent COVID/COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. Concomitant medications included antidepressants. The patient received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine last 14Jan2021 at 3pm, and everything went well. When he left the place, he had a slight headache. He had to stay there for 15-20 minutes to make sure he had no reaction. He just got a little lightheaded, he didn&#39;t think much, and it didn&#39;t get worse. The patient took 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL) and forgot about it. It went away for a while. He took the shot at 3 pm and he took paracetamol at 4 pm. Later that night, about 10 pm, everything kicked in. He was sick again at 10:30 pm, or so, the headache was gone for several hours. He was ok between 4 pm and 10 pm. Then about 10 to 10:30 pm, when he went to go to sleep, his heart started racing, like he was having a panic attack, then he started getting hot flashes, sweating, chills, and aching, and this went all night from like 10 pm to 11 to the next morning. He had a doctor&#39;s appointment to get his knee examined for an upcoming knee surgery. The patient clarified that he didn&#39;t go to the doctor because of the symptoms, he went for his knee. He asked the doctor, before getting examined, and the doctor said he got off easy, as the doctor himself was sick for 3 days. The patient asked the doctor if he could take something to calm down, as his blood pressure was high on 15Jan2021 at 8 am. They had taken his blood pressure to examine his knee, and the doctor said it was alright. He was prescribed with alprazolam (XANAX), and the doctor said it would be fine. The next day, he was tired from the night before. He had no symptoms the next day. After he took alprazolam, he slept fine, he felt better. The hot flashes, heart racing, body aches, and chills were gone, and he read everything as far as symptoms. The heart racing went away about 11 the next morning because he took alprazolam. The patient stated that he forgot to add one more, he had all the symptoms described as side effects, but he also had itching. He had very mild itching and was given cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC, lot number: OHE2723, expiry date: Feb2022, UPC: 4122053077), it was like 80% gone. Every now and again he has a little itch, but it was bothering him all night that first night. Currently, the patient felt pretty good. He has no symptoms other than the slight itch. He further stated that his second dose is on 04Feb2021. Out of all symptoms, the thing that freaked him out the most was the heart racing, he asked if he could take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) before the shot. He has been on antidepressants for a while, he has a lot of anxiety, but the day he went in, he felt good, and didn&#39;t take alprazolam. He also asked if this have triggered all that heart racing stuff. He was seeking for information if there was anything to do to prepare him better, he knew you have to sit there for 15-20 minutes to see if there was a reaction. The outcome of the event headache and lightheadedness was recovered on 14Jan2021, unknown for blood pressure high and tiredness, recovering for itchy, and recovered on 15Jan2021 at 11 am for all other events.

Later that night I noticed a decided lack of energy and some arm soreness at the shot site when I touched it. The chills and fever subsided after about two to three hours, but the rest of the symptoms continued until I fell asleep around midnight, which was about 12 hours after getting the shot. The aches, arm soreness and weakness all lasted for about a week afterwards, with the weakness being the last thing to go.

                                                The day after receiving my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I noticed a rash had started on the right side of my face and also on the third finger (the one closest to my pinky) on the right hand. The rash grew progressively worse over the course of the week, where now it covers a major portion of my torso, forming two triangle-shaped peaks rising from my hip bones to just below the under-arm, a rash running from my left bicep to the first quarter of my left forearm, on my left wrist, on my right wrist, a patch on my right forearm, a patch down the outside of my right leg, thigh to knee, and a small patch under my left knee.

And I didn&#39;t touch anything outside so.assume it&#39;s from the shot.  I still have it and treatment doesn&#39;t help much.

Had a bout of &#34;double vision&#34; for approximately a minute - never had this before - another very scary thing.  Two days ago experienced &#34;highway hypnosis&#34; - zoned out while driving for 10 minutes - lost time event / can&#39;t remember driving the route I did - never had this before - another very scary thing.

Similar to tall pimples or mini blisters, maybe 1/16 inch tall.  It was an itchy rash that lasted for a month or so.  I received my second dose of the vaccine three weeks after the first dose and had no adverse affects from the second dose.  The rash area has scarred now with dark marks on area on forearm.  No other after affects.

Performed gentle lymph drainage massage to Right trunk/shoulder regions and added Lymph Tone II homeopathic drops 3 times daily, with resulting dissipation of  fluid in the pec region and decreased soreness.

                                                Second injection on a Friday.  Starting Sunday, 4/18, I have had waxing and waning hives - most pronounced at night but also periodically throughout the day.  I also had a swollen lip when I woke Tuesday morning, 4/20/21.  The swollen lip returned to normal after about two hours and has not returned.  I still have recurring hives that wax and wane throughout the day and at night.  I do not consider the hives to be a heavy rash.  They are itchy enough today that I took a Benadryl.  I would have taken one last night, but I had to drive 3 hours to a funeral today.     In addition, following the first vaccination (on 3/26/21), I had a swollen lip that night.    I did not consider attributing any of the foregoing symptoms to the vaccine until I read about symptoms at about 2 am this morning.  The fact sheet given to me when I got the vaccination really doesn&#39;t highlight the potential for a swollen lip or the onset of hives a couple days after the injection.  I did not have any immediate reaction to the injection (i.e., none during the 15 minute waiting period following either shot).

A 62-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8732), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 30Mar2021 at 01:00 PM (13:00), as first dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included bipolar depression from probably 10 years ago (2011) and ongoing, torn rotator cuff (15 to 20 years ago), and food poisoning in mid-Aug2020 (maybe it was more than that; may get tested to see if he ever had COVID-19). The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included vilazodone hydrochloride (VIIBRYD) from 2017 and ongoing (for at least four years) for bipolar depression. The patient has no known allergies. The patient was one of those people who doesn&#39;t get sick and he doesn&#39;t normally get the flu shot and everyone told him to get this Pfizer vaccine. The patient was not panicking but got the first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine on Tuesday (30Mar2021) around 01:00 PM and saw some things about having soreness on the around the shot site and all of that from that night (30Mar2021). This is going on for three days (from 30Mar2021) with severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is; if you ever have pulled a rotator cuff it feels like that and he has not slept in almost 3 days due to pain from 30Mar2021. The pain is severe at times that it makes him nauseous (Mar2021). He figured the soreness was normal and later in the evening on 30Mar2021, the pain became an issue when he tried to go to bed that evening. Since the first two nights compared to last night, the soreness is actually improved; every time he tries to sleep with pain as a factor it is not easy. The patient can feel throbbing with his heartbeat and with the circulation there is throbbing pain. The pain was terrible and was throbbing like his heartbeat and similar to like a shoulder rotator cuff injury. For the first two days, on Tuesday (30Mar2021) and Wednesday (31Mar2021) after the vaccine, he could not use his arm or lift his arm above his mid face level. According to the patient, it was like a rotator cuff and he had a torn rotator cuff 15 to 20 years ago and this is the same arm that his torn rotator cuff occurred in; this is very painful and he is comparing it to the torn rotator cuff. In Mar2021, the patient had burning and tingling down the left arm and 3 days no sleep because the pain is worse at night. During the last week (Mar2021), his left leg down to his foot is also tingling and burning. The patient&#39;s primary care physician just retired, and he is in the process of finding a new one. The patient had no treatment or physician or emergency room (ER) visit for the reported events because being in the ER field, he can tell right now that it would be a waste of time of the effort to go into the ER as they would do nothing but tell him to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) and that is it. The patient did not like to take paracetamol and hates taking paracetamol. The patient clarified it is generic acetaminophen extra strength (Strength: 500 mg; Lot Number: P119682, Expiration Date: Mar2022, UPC Number: 5084417594) that he has taken (maybe every 6 hours oral) and it does relieve the pain so that is only so good. He does not know if in motion of the course of the day, something happened because at night laying still in bed is when he has pain. The patient did a lot of research before he made this call and the severity of the pain is enough to actually keep him awake for three days. He thought it was severe pain; maybe he should have told them to administer the vaccine in his right arm, but it was administered into his left arm. The only reason he made this call was because he wanted someone to know what he was having which could be just completely normal and he is sure every reaction is different and he expected the soreness because he remembers as a kid having shots. Also, this level of pain he is experiencing is what he wanted to report; imagine having  himself going three days without a full night of sleep and he wanted to report this to make sure Pfizer knew this if they were keeping track of numbers of how many people have a similar pain level. The patient also asked if there were other people who called and reported these symptoms and if there is any information or treatment recommendations. As of 08Apr2021, even up to five days after getting the shot, now going on seven days that he has had some pretty severe reactions. The patient called in after 3 nights of getting no sleep. The patient was calling today to see if someone was ever going to call him back and asking will there be a follow up call from someone to see if he&#39;s still alive. The patient had some pretty severe reactions and they have actually gotten worse. There also have been new developments. The patient had pain in his arm that pulses along with his heart rate. It is so bad that it kept him up for 3 nights and still wakes him up at night. The pulsing pain in his arm started on the first night and has gradually gotten worse. The pain in the arm that is enough that it keeps him awake at night only starts getting severe when he goes to bed. He has tried sleeping in an upright position and he has tried everything, and nothing seems to alleviate it. The patient took generic acetaminophen which did not work during his last phone call. The patient also tried naproxen sodium (ALEVE) and that doesn&#39;t work wither. It was absolutely debilitating at times to where he has a 50% deficit with the use of his left arm (Mar2021). The patient initially reported burning and tingling sensation that was on his left arm and went to his hand and fingertips but now it has progressed to the whole left side of his body including his rib line, hip, leg, and foot. He is a retired paramedic and is pretty sure he is not having a long stroke. The patient feels it is too long to have symptoms from a shot he got. The patient has a lot of friends in the medical field and he&#39;s been told even going to a primary care physician, it is kind of gray area when it comes to dealing with COVID-19 vaccines. The patient was having second thoughts about getting the second shot. He had been told he can take NSAIDS over the counter for pain which has not helped him; there is no protocol for diagnosing or treating anything that happens from the shot. People in the medical field have told him there is thin line now to treat side effects because of liability; some doctors won&#39;t even get into it, just refer to Pfizer because medical insurance will not cover any services related to COVID-19 vaccine reactions. The patient continues to explain that is why the federal government is the only one that owns the shot due to liability. The patient&#39;s main concern is calling and reporting and maybe getting some help in deciding whether or not to get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. In his opinion, that is too long to have pain that he cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up. This all happened along with the shot, the same night and there are times where he can&#39;t work due to it. The patient asks if anyone is concerned with it and will someone feel bad because he doesn&#39;t get the second shot. His main concern is that people are underscoring or even lying about side effects, stating he can&#39;t believe he is an isolated case. The patient continued to ask if this is something he&#39;s stuck with, or if it is something he would have to deal with from now on from getting this shot. The patient regrets getting the first shot and stated that if he knew then what he would be going through now, he wouldn&#39;t have got it. The patient has no sort of history of being a hypochondriac and the feelings he is going through right now are sensations that he has never felt in his life. The patient continues to explain he doesn&#39;t even know how to categorize it other than mentally relating it to the shot since it all occurred in line with Mar2021 getting the shot. The patient further commented that if he ran a call with an ambulance right now with a patient telling him what i he was telling the company, he wouldn&#39;t even know what to do with them other than getting them comfortable and to a hospital. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Soreness on the around the shot site&#34;, &#34;Severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is&#34;, and &#34; Has not slept due to pain; cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

Now 18 days out from second shot, about 98% recovered from shoulder injury.

Received 2 dose of Epinephrine during ED visit. 5/13/21 After Janssen vaccine he received at this morning around 8:10 AM.  After that he had almost the exact same symptoms with a shooting pain in the left arm and neck some left hand tingling and swelling to the point where he can&#39;t get his wedding ring off and a sensation of pressure/tingling/fullness in the left side.   Given Benadryl and steroids, initially there is no airway concerns or compromise.  However after a period of time, he thought his voice was different.  He did sound just slightly raspy, though I did question whether this could be related to dryness from the Benadryl.  Regardless given that he did note a change, we opted to go ahead and give a dose of epinephrine, which did resolve his symptoms

                                                Coronary artery disease; mild tenderness of the injection site of right deltoid; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer sponsored program from a contactable consumer (patient). A 62-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (reported as Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in deltoid right on 18May2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0172) as 1st dose, single at the age of 62-year-old for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included essential thrombocythaemia from May2014 and ongoing (Outpatient at withheld since 2015 for this condition. This is a myeloproliferative disorder where bone marrow makes too many blood platelets. Previously on chemotherapeutic agent hydroxyurea from time of diagnosis May2014 until 29Jun2020. Has not been on any other medication since then except low dose aspirin), chest pain, headache, and nausea from 2021 (all started approximately 4-6 weeks prior to 20May2021). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) (reported as Low Dose Aspirin) at 81 mg from May2014 and ongoing for essential thrombocythaemia, hydroxycarbamide (HYDROXYUREA) for essential thrombocythaemia from May2014 to 29Jun2020 (Previously on chemotherapeutic agent hydroxyurea from time of diagnosis May2014 until 29Jun2020). Patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 18May2021. From 20May2021 to 25May2021 he got hospitalized and took a blood thinner for 5 days. He is scheduled to receive the second dose of bnt162b2 on 08Jun2021. He wants to know if he can still get the second dose of bnt162b2 if he took the blood thinner for 5 days when he got hospitalized. Patient clarified that he was administered his first dose of bnt162b2 on 18May2021. He reported having chest pains, headaches and nausea that all started approximately 4-6 weeks prior to 20May2021 which was the date he was admitted to the hospital relative to those events. He specified that these events were ongoing prior to him ever being administered the bnt162b2. He was admitted to the hospital on 20May2021 until discharged on 25May2021. He has had no further episodes of these events, but whether recovered completely or with lasting effects is unknown. Patient is a retired medical laboratory technician, has a degree, has worked in medical labs in the past but is currently retired. Admitted to hospital as cardiac patient with no cardiac history prior to initial onset of these events around 4-6 weeks prior to 20May2021. He was brought to the hospital emergency department via ambulance that he himself called. While hospitalized they recommended surgery to him, he declined surgery, left the hospital and is seeking another opinion. While hospitalized he was administered blood thinner or anti-coagulant Heparin intravenously. He was not sure if he started Heparin on 20May2021 or 21May2021, but thinks it was from 21May2021 to 25May2021. He thinks he was brought to the hospital and admitted somewhere between 22:30 on 20May2021 and 00:00 21May2021; but verified hospitalization repeatedly as starting 20May2021. Patient provided additional details regarding these events: about 4-6 weeks prior to 20May2021 he had been having rather severe headaches, nausea and chest pain-not constantly, but having them. He had been able to function, in other words take care of himself, do business although sometimes a bit difficult and uncomfortable because of those symptoms but got it done. On 20May2021 when this continued he had been pretty busy that day out from about 10:00 or 11:00 until about 21:30. He accomplished everything he wanted to do that day, had eaten a couple of times. He had no headaches that day, had some chest pains, nausea but at end of day when he came home about 21:30 he had the worst chest pain of the day. Because he had been having these types of symptoms: headaches, nausea, chest pain for 4-6 weeks before that, he called ambulance went to local hospital called his primary doctors&#39; office before he did that; and so they agreed he should go so he did. The tests that were performed were amongst many blood tests from CBCs to chemistry to PTT to a PTT because he had been put on heparin particularly. Maybe a lipid profile type test, was given an echocardiogram and an angiogram. Put on a cardiac unit; no prior cardiac history or heart problems prior to this. Regarding results they were saying he had coronary artery disease; that had 3 modes of treatment: anything from medication regimen only to stent to bypass or open heart surgery so that&#39;s the sort of testing that was done. He never looked, he&#39;s going to get records in the future. He has been a medical lab technologist he knows how to draw the labs; he knows what the purple top for CBC with or without diff is; he knows EDTA ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid is, he knows the light blue top is gonna be sodium citrate for coagulation studies for prothrombin time etc.; he knows the red topper is maybe chemistry; so know those kinds of things, he knows how to perform venipuncture blood sample, finger stick and heel sticks. He had no history of cardiac problems other than what appears to be going on now; never been on anticoagulant before this hospitalization. He does not believe the chest pain, nausea and headaches are attributable to the vaccine; he is not going to say it couldn&#39;t be that; but on the surface he does not think the vaccine had anything to do with the events-events were going on before he got the bnt162b2. At the time he got the bnt162b2 he believes he mentioned having essential thrombocytosis and may have mentioned that he was an outpatient at that facility. He also mentioned he had mild tenderness of the injection site of right deltoid; but that is common and expected with any intramuscular injection; he did not notice any other types of side effects he could attribute to the vaccine. The mild tenderness of the injection site of right deltoid onset date and time was immediately or shortly after the time of injection on 18May2021 and only lasted about a day, stopped about 19May2021; event was nothing unusual. Unknown if recovered completely. Product name repeatedly verified by patient. Patient provided additional details from CDC vaccine record card: Vaccine first dose Covid-19 product name/manufacturer lot number: the following information was handwritten into the card by the people who administered the vaccine to him: Pfizer EW0172. Covid-19 vaccination record card. date administered: 18May2021. Facility: withheld-which he later referred to interchangeably as withheld. When he received initial dose on 18May2021, outside of the CDC vaccine record card, he was given future appointment card and a multi-page document all together titled Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers; and in that information, that&#39;s how he came to call Pfizer. There&#39;s a telephone number inside, on page 5 of this document; in the section titled additional information it says if you have questions visit the website or call telephone number provided below: withheld that&#39;s how he got the number to call Pfizer. On page 2 of that same document section: What you should mention to your vaccination provider before you get the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine? Tell the vaccination provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you have any allergies, have a fever, have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner, are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, are breastfeeding, have received another COVID-19 vaccine. What prompted him to call was on and before 18May2021 he had not been hospitalized; he was not having any bleeding disorder or on any blood thinner. He gets the first dose on 18May2021 he is scheduled for second dose on 08Jun2021 about 21 days after the dose at same place; what prompted the call today is, he was hospitalized with chest pains. During that hospital stay was on Heparin. He was not diagnosed with any bleeding disorder. He has no longer been on any blood thinner of any kind since 25May2021. So his question is given the fact that he is scheduled for the second dose, should he still get the second dose of bnt162b2 or not. He does not want to wait until he goes back to the healthcare facility to ask them that question. As far as he knows it now, he is not seeing any other reason he could not get the second dose of bnt162b2 as scheduled. Of course that is considering that nothing else happens in the interim but he does not foresee anything happening. He does not know what time it takes for Heparin to get out of your system, hasn&#39;t researched that yet. Heparin: Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Not provided, administered in hospital. Chest pains, nausea, headaches require a visit to emergency room, the patient was hospitalized, from 20May2021 to 25May2021. Patient called in and stated that he received the fact sheet after receiving the 1st dose last 18May2021 and he noticed that there&#39;s a certain part in the fact sheet that what you will tell your vaccination center. He mentioned that he is not in a blood thinner when he received the 1st dose and after that he got hospitalized for 5 days from 20May2021 up to 25May2021 and during those days he was in a blood thinner. Now he wants to know since he will be receiving the 2nd dose on 08Jun2021, is he eligible to get the vaccine since from 25May2021 until now he is not in a blood thinner. Patient stated he received the first dose of the bnt162b2 on 18May2021 and he is scheduled to receive his second dose on 08Jun2021. Two days after his first dose, on 20May2021 he was hospitalized, he stated that he was experiencing symptoms even before receiving the vaccine, like headache, nausea and chest pain. He went to the ER on 20May2021 to get evaluated and treated and he stayed in the hospital for 5 days, from 20May2021 to 25May2021. During his hospitalization he was administered IV heparin, he hasn&#39;t received any since the got out of the hospital on 25May2021. He is not taking blood thinners currently and he does not have a bleeding disorder, but he read on the Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers to mention the vaccination provider all your medical conditions including if you have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner. Should he receive the second dose of the vaccine as scheduled? Patient stated he is 100% sure his hospitalization is not related to the vaccine since he had the symptoms before. He also stated that he did not experience any side effects after receiving the vaccine and that the hospital staff is aware that he received the first dose of bnt162b2 on 18May2021. The patient was recovered from mild tenderness of the injection site of right deltoid on 19May2021. The outcome of other event was unknown.

During the 15 mins I was waiting I ask the guy do this suppose to happen and he said that after the 15 min way, it should go away.  An then the next day my hand was still hurting and the next I called my PCP and said, nothing that we can do. An then I waited and I called a doctor friend at Clinic and take Claritin because it was itching and so he said to try calamine lotion. It seemed to help but I would still have the numbing feeling. It felt like nerve damage. So I called Dr. and she gave a prescription for  Betamethasone Dipropionate  cream USP (Augmented). It has helped but it is still there on my arm. I can only use it for 2 weeks. It has only been a week. So, we will see what happens.

                                                I had a very small, left sided C5 dermatome breakout of a rash that appeared to be herpes zoster (shingles).  I?ve never had a rash like this before.  It?s now been 2&#43; weeks and is fading, leaving me with mild burning and itching in same area.   I went ahead and had 2cd dose on 1/7/21.    FYI:    I?m an Emergency Physician myself.

                                                He has irritation on his arms.; he got the first shot of the covid vaccine he  started itching; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 63-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) oral from 2019 (reported as 2 years ago as of 06Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 30 mg capsule once as needed for acid reflux, oxycodone oral from 2020 (reported as 3-4 months ago as of 06Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 10mg tablet once by mouth as needed for chronic pain from two back surgeries that did not go well, omeprazole oral from 2020 (reported as about a year ago as of 06Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 20 mg capsule once by mouth as needed for acid reflux. Medical history included ongoing low white blood cells has had for a couple of years, and two back surgeries. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Flu shots. The patient took his first dose of the COVID Vaccine last Thursday (31Dec2020) and about 10 minutes after he started itching. That day he had previously taken a PPI medication for acid reflux, Dexilant, and some pain medication, Oxycodone. Since then he has been trying to rule out what is going on and what gave him the itching. Now, every time he takes his PPI medication, either Dexilant, or Omeprazole, he itches. This did not happen prior to getting the vaccine. He asks, how long does the COVID Vaccine stay in the system for? He is supposed to get the second dose in 3 weeks, but he does not want the same results. He was asking if it is normal for his to experiencing itching and how long will it occur. He has to take his medications. He does not want issues with his esophagus, but he also does not want to itch. The itching right after he got the vaccine lasted about a day or so and dissipated by Friday. Saturday he did not have it. Then he took a Dexilant that day, on Saturday, for acid reflux, and he itched until the Dexilant was out of his system. Then yesterday, he tried an Omeprazole and he had the same results. He can not even wear a pajama top or anything on his arms cause it makes him itch. He has irritation on his arms on Jan2021. He also has low white blood cells, which he had prior to getting the vaccine. He started Dexilant originally about 2 years ago. He takes it only when he needs it. Has taken it about 3-4 times prior to getting the COVID Vaccine. He started Omeprazole about a year ago. Only takes this as needed, PRN, even thought the doctor said he should not take it as needed. He does not like to take medicine so he tries not to take things. He has taken flu shots in the past, he gets one every year, and has never had an issue with that. He wants to get the second dose of the vaccine, he just does not want to itch. The action taken in response to the event for dexlansoprazole, oxycodone, omeprazole was unknown. Event outcome of itching was recovered on Jan2020, while for other event(s) was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

No additional vaccines administered on same date of the suspect. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. He has not had reactions to any other vaccines. On 30Dec2020 he tested positive for Covid. His symptoms of covid started 27Dec2020 in the evening sometime probably around 7pm. He experienced cough in Dec2020. No visit to physician office was required. On the 06Jan2021 he went to the emergency room but that was because he was concerned about rash he developed. He thought it was due to the Tylenol he was taking. Relevant tests performed in Ja2021 included: blood work and chest X-ray did when he went in for the rash and they were was fine. He was treated with steroid injection for the rash. The rash cleared up in the next couple days. As of 12Jan2021 the only thing he has cough but he coughs anyway. He still had a cough but it was not atypical for him to have a cough. He was scheduled to receive his second dose on 13Jan2021. He no longer had any Covid symptoms and wanted to know if he could still get the second dose as scheduled. The outcome of event tested positive for the virus and not recovered was unknown, of coughs was not recovered. A Product Complaint was filed.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose on the left arm for vaccination. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism. Concomitant medication include levothyroxine (manufacturer unknown) from an unspecified date probably 2-3 years ago and ongoing for hypothyroidism. The patient reported that the first dose was administered of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 04Jan2021. He had onset of soreness in left arm that day, 14Jan2021 which he recovered completely from by 05Jan2021. He stated that starting maybe 05Jan2021 or 06Jan2021, he had onset of feeling kind of achy and like he was wanting to run a fever. Starting 08Jan2021, he started running a very high fever in excess of 102 degrees Fahrenheit which has been ongoing and persistent since then. He has been taking Tylenol every 6 hours to try to control the high fever but the high fever is just not going away. He was wondering if there is anything he can do because his primary care physician (PCP) can&#39;t really help him at the clinic; He was wondering if Pfizer is familiar with this reaction and if there are any recommendations regarding them. He has taken Tylenol to help, but it is not making it go away. He wanted to know if steroids could be used to counteract this side effect. He added that he is supposed to get the second dose 25Jan2021 but he does not plan to get the second dose, at this point he does not want to do that. He was administered the vaccine because his mother lives in an assisted living facility where the vaccine was offered to residents; and because he acts as a sitter at the facility it was offered to him. On 11Jan2021 he went to Urgent Care for these events, and was given a Rapid COVID-19 Test which had negative result. The outcome of the event soreness in left arm was recovered on 05Jan2021, the outcome of the event was wanting to run a fever/very high fever in excess of 102 degrees fahrenheit was not recovered and the outcome of the event feeling kind of achy was unknown.

I felt pressure in head/neck area and had dry cough that evening.  Took Advil PM before going to bed.  About 2am that night I started having severe chills.  I took temp at 5am and it was 101.7.  Took Tylenol and temp went to 99.8 by 7 am.  Temp went back up to 101.5 by noon.   Had called my workplace medical and they want me to stay out for 3 days due to the reaction.

Took Benadryl, used Hydrocortisone cream and Calamine lotion.  At the time of this report (5th day after vaccine) the rise and itch have substantially subsided for the 1st time. The purpura is starting to burst and leak clear fluid. Estimate 50% improvement from 12 hours ago.

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: Not Reported), via an unspecified route of administration on Arm Right on 18Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included spinal injury, an infection in his scrotum, some neurogenic things, white blood cells (his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine). There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that, the consumer stated, &#34;my wife and me went to hospital and we got a COVID vaccine first one, we had some, my wife had terrible side effects, I am crippled, and I had not it before in Mar2021, she is ok, but she is just sick, I am sick, but she is very sick and she got bad stuffs (rash).&#34; Caller states that both him and his wife were having some side effects, although his wife was having the worse trouble. Caller states that last night, him and his wife were up all night. Caller was up because his wife was up so sick. Caller states that both him and his wife are sick and disabled, that is why they got the shot. Caller reports that he is retired and disabled because he got hurt at work. Caller states that what he is experiencing, is he just feels bad on 18Mar2021. Caller states that he did previously go to a doctor to do a blood study, the doctor is looking for blood diseases or cancer in the caller, and caller thinks that taking the COVID shot just exposed his weak spots. Caller reports that both him and his wife have body aches. Caller was wondering if there was anything, he can go get over the counter at the pharmacy to help. Caller reports that he cannot call his doctor, because they are all out on Fridays. Caller states that him and his wife are not planning to take the second dose of the product. Caller states that they have a lot of hurricanes where they live. Their house got tore up in one, and they sold it to one of their sons, and the caller and his wife moved out to their beach house for a while. He had an infection in his scrotum, something stung him, and that is what the doctors are looking for in him now, because his white blood cell count is high, and he has a rash on his scrotum in Mar2021. It was infected. Caller states that this infection in his scrotum has flared back up since getting the COVID vaccine yesterday, so caller had thought it went away but he guesses it never went away. Caller confirms that the issues with his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine, but the caller thinks that the vaccine was exposing the caller&#39;s weak spots, and maybe that is a god send because it is all flared up now, and the caller will be able to tell his doctor that. Caller states that he has been getting high white blood cell count readings since the stuff with his scrotum first started, and that is why his doctor sent him to an Oncologist for all this blood testing, so maybe this will be a b lessing in disguise for the caller, in finding out what is wrong with him. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Rash covering the majority of my face when I woke up the next day. No hives and did not itch. Red patches and blotches. Not really bothersome. Got a little better every day until it was hard to see any a week later. Momentary dizziness, also the next day, like a three second flash, when rising from laying flat, laying flat from standing or sitting, or rolling over while laying down. Passes and I can sleep and not notice it unless I am awake enough, and cognizant enough, to notice it when I roll over. Once standing and moving about there is no problem except a feeling, I have seen described as brain fog, of being a little off mentally. Not sharp, but no dizziness. Can maintain normal activity that includes bending over, kneeling down, driving and riding in a car without any dizziness. Have tried eply maneuver, something I can do, but have not had any improvement. Brain fog seems to improve with normal daily movement and I have been trying to avoid my normal caffeine intake.

                                                I am current diabetic and have a recent history (1 year ago) of muscular dystrophy. I use a cane to assist with mobility, and cannot lift my legs far to go up high stairs, nor lift my arms past my chest as a baseline.   Later in the evening/middle of the night, after the second shot, I got up around 3:30am to use the rest room and after each step, my knees, legs, hips, and arms gave out,  falling forward on my face and head. I had no strength to catch myself from falling, nor could I lift myself at all. Initially, I could not even roll over. It took 10 minutes with help from my wife to roll over, but I remained on the floor. I was on the bathroom floor/snake crawling for 2 hours trying to figure out ways I can get up, but I had no strength at all. After snake crawling to the bedroom, my wife called the paramedics to get me up at 530am, Tuesday April 6th.    Later that night of the 6th I did a little better, with help  I could sit up in the bed.  Overnight I tried to lift up to stand, and barely could stand, but my legs were too shaky, body bruised of course, and weak.   April 7th, the next day, I was able to sit up. Later that day I was able to get up to go to the bathroom with my wife?s help and the use of a rolling walker with wheels, brakes and a seat, about 3:50am this morning.  I have 35-40% of my strength, and can sit on the side of the bed. I need assistance to the bathroom and I have a ways to go to recover to my baseline.

As the numbness traveled from the injection site (left to right) across my neck and face, the numb areas became a &#34;tingling&#34; feeling on face, lips, chin and below the eye.  Again traveling from left to right (the injection was in the left arm). Day two the above symptoms have lessened but have not gone away.  Starting the same evening of the injection I experienced a progressively worse headache.  As of 4/13/2021 I still have some numbness and tingling on the left side of my lower face between my cheek and chin.  Headache is going away slowly.

                                                I received the shot around 9am, That evening my left arm was a bit sore as well as my neck muscles. The next day I had several of my old Shingles symptoms return, weird feeling in my left eye, itchy eyebrow muscle, itchy skin on left side.  (I had the shingles about 15 years ago, LEFT side, not too bad, mostly itchy, with recurring odd things just mentioned maybe once a year) The the 2nd day I got a weird tingling, buzzing feeling in my left upper back above shoulder blade, like those TENS device electric muscle stimulators. This is similar to my shingles twitches, but different and NEW.  Maybe I should have taken the shot in my right arm? I may take the second shot in my right arm.

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (at the age of 63 years old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing bone cancer, ongoing pain from bone cancer, and nausea (has had nausea with the cancer). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient called about COVID-19 vaccine and mentioned that he received the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 25Mar2021 and experienced side effects not right away but shortly thereafter. He mentioned that he has bone cancer and he experience a lot of pain due to his bone cancer. He does not have an easy life as he experiences a lot of pain due to his bone cancer. He has a lot of pain to begin with because of the cancer that he has and now pain has been worse recently.  He does not know if it just the progression of the pain or if it is coming from the injection.  The patient confirmed that he experienced lists of side effects of more tired/tiredness, more headaches/headache, muscle pain, joint pain, injection site swelling and redness, slight nausea, feeling unwell, and swollen lymph nodes. He still feels very sick, is in a lot of pain, and not feeling well. He confirmed this list is from the paperwork he was given and adds that the only thing that he feels is light nausea that is not very severe.  He added that he has had nausea with the cancer, so this nausea would be very light.  But, he also he has a headache and tiredness. The patient added that his pain has increased, and the pain is the worst. The patient did not know how long it will take before feeling side effects from the vaccine or how that works.  The patient asked if the side effects is same for everyone or if it is different for everybody. He added that reporting the event is not going to help in finding out where he is going with this.  He stated he is at a crossroads, trying to determine if he needs to increase his pain medication since he now has more pain. He understands that Pfizer does not provide medical advice.  He states that he was asking Pfizer to see if Pfizer has an understanding of when these side effects might show themselves or when they would and how severe they would come. His second vaccination is due on 15Apr2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

After a few seconds caller&#39;s throat opened back up. States it was freaky. Never had that happen before. Throat opened back up, but scared patient real good.

                                                Patient is a pleasant 63-year-old gentleman who came to the hospital originally on 4/10/2021, refer you to the H&amp;P done at that time by Dr. Comes in with a diffuse rash over his torso and his legs. He did get COVID vaccine, his first one (4/1/21 at Imaginetics) about a week to a week and a half before admission. He said shortly thereafter is when his symptoms began. The rash is pruritic. He had no breathing troubles whatsoever. No throat closing or tongue swelling, etc. No mouth lesions and in fact the rash over his torso and his back is pretty minimal, looks more like a sunburn type appearance. In any case, also had a petechial type of purpuric rash on his legs and I did show this to Dermatology who felt that it did look like vasculitis. He was placed on                                                                                                                                                                                                                      steroids. He did SOLU-MEDROL while here and this was converted to prednisone on discharge for which he will continue with for the next few weeks. Slow taper. Rash had improved over his stay here. His LFTs were also up somewhat as well, but these did improve while he was here and multiple imaging studies were done including ultrasound, CAT scan and abdominal Doppler all were negative for any kind of                                                        pathology. Suspect probably these elevated LFTs could have been from vasculitis and that is also improving now with the steroids. He is tolerating diet well. He has no abdominal pain. Okay to be discharged today.  We will continue with prednisone taper. Follow with PCP in 1 week. Also know, there is an ANA pending as further workup for                                                                                                                                                            vasculitis. We will defer to PCP on follow up for that.    4/21/21                                                                                                                                                       Follow-up with PCP: 63-year-old male here for a hospital follow-up. He was hospitalized for rash suspected to be vasculitis and elevated LFTs-started 2-3 days after his COVID vaccine. Etiology of elevated LFTs unclear. Liver US and CT were negative. Hepatitis, viral testing, and ANA negative. Received his first COVID vaccine on 4/1. Still on prednisone taper for rash. He is feeling better, still somewhat tired. Rash is almost resolved. Current complaints sore on the left side of his tongue for the past 11 days. Initially hurt when he would eat, is better now. Is back at work. Denies abdominal pain nausea, vomiting, stool changes, dark or light stools, yellowing of skin, swelling in abdomen or legs. Does not use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. No history of liver issues. Normal LFTs 7 months ago. Follow up appt at Allergy/Immunology on 4/29/21: Plan: Patient had a delayed reaction to his 1st dose of Pfizer vaccination that included symptoms of arthralgias, rash as well as elevated liver enzymes.  His symptoms don&#39;t meet criteria for type 1 IgE mediated reaction so skin testing would not be beneficial.  His symptoms required hospitalization and improved with tapered steroid course.  His symptoms did not fit DRESS syndrome criteria as he did not have peripheral eosinophilia, fevers, sloughing of skin/oral mucosa or blistering.  We discussed how there is not much data or case reports about how to proceed with completing vaccination for COVID.  I would recommend he get Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination since it is a different class of vaccine and he may not have the same reaction but again this is not guaranteed.  There is a small chance of clotting with Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine as well.  He should pre-medicate with cetirizine 20 mg po qday for 1 week before vaccination and 2 weeks after.  I would also suggest he get a steroid course to have on hand from his PCP in case rash starts again after vaccination.  It may be beneficial to have him get lab work several days after vaccination as well (U/A, CBC, CMP) to evaluate for any inflammation.

A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: LL3302) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 05Feb2021 at 12:00 (63-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes from 2009 or 2010 and ongoing; high blood pressure from 2009 or 2010 and ongoing; ongoing cirrhosis of the liver (As a little boy at 8 years old he got a cut on his right hand. His Mother took him to the Emergency Department and they gave him blood. All that time he didn&#39;t know, until he discovered it at age 32-34. He found out from his primary doctor he had Hepatitis C. His doctor asked if he shot up drugs. He said he did a little pot.  He cut the main artery in his wrist); ongoing heart problems (He always felt problems with his heart. It started in 2014 when he went to the Emergency Room for pain in his chest. They checked his heart and found his blood didn&#39;t flow to the right. It flowed to the left. The Cardiologist told him sometimes his heart beats and sometime it doesn&#39;t. He had 2 veins with blockage, they couldn&#39;t do anything and put him on medication for that); prostate cancer From Dec2019 (He had Cancer twice. He was first diagnosed of Prostate Cancer and received Radiation therapy. He had an exam and the Cancer was back. He had surgery for the Prostate Cancer 18Feb2020); COVID-19 (in the past. His wife had COVID-19 and he had COVID with the same symptoms. He lost his taste for 9 days at the end of Dec2020. He got sick after his wife had COVID-19. His wife got better after having COVID-19. He had no appetite, it was pretty bad). Concomitant medications included a lot of medication (Details were not provided). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: BL3302) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 14Jan2021 at 16:30 (62-year-old at time of vaccination), at 0.3ml, single, for COVID-19 immunization and experienced left arm hurt. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Patient weighs between 158-159 pounds. Patient experienced left arm warm and pain after second shot was from 05Feb2021 to 06Feb2021. Patient states he received the second dose on 05Feb2021 and within 30 minutes he started to feel the shot, it was working up in his head, felt like something was working. It was warm and sore. Patient states a couple hours later he was taking Tylenol because his arm was sore. He applied the muscle rub/muscle wrap the next day and it was better. Patient states the day before reporting he began using eyedrops more than usual and using 5 drops because he feels like something is stuck in his eyes. States it&#39;s almost like COVID is in his eyes. In the past month he has been using eye drops more often.  He had been using them before the vaccine. His eyes were itching and he would use the drops to flush them out. Patient would like to know if feeling like something is in the eye is something related to the vaccine or a symptom of COVID-19. He has a lot of sickness. Adverse events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of Left arm warm and pain after second shot was recovered on 06Feb2021; outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Within 5 minutes of getting shot, my right forearm and hand tingled, turned red and started swelling. Next, I felt dizzy and light headed. A nurse then placed a BP cuff on me and measured my BP at 185/150. My oxygen level was 98. My face, neck and arms turned very red and my face - cheeks, nose and lips started to swell. They gave me apple juice and crackers. After about 45 minutes, my right arm was normal, the color in my face, neck and arms returned to normal, my BP was 150/90. My cheeks, nose and lips remained swollen. After another hour passed, I felt ok, so I left. I took Zyrtec and then Benadril, but they didn&#39;t help. My doctor prescribed prednisone but took me off of it after 3 days as it had no affect. After a week, the swelling in my cheeks and nose subsided, but as of today 5-6-21 my lips are still swollen.

Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (diagnosed for a decade), ongoing hypertension (diagnosed for a decade), ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus (5-6 years ago diagnosed, very well maintained type 2 diabetes), ongoing pneumonia (He has been hospitalized 4 different times for pneumonia. In Dec2020 when he had pneumonia, they did not hospitalize him. He has had pneumonia 5 time since 1982. Concomitant medication included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. &#34;He gets the flu shot every, and he has had the shingles shot. He also gets the pneumonia vaccine every 2 years.&#34; The patient experienced pneumonia (hospitalization) on an unspecified date with outcome of not recovered, itchy, on 08Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, dry cough on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered and non-productive cough on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: unknown results on Oct2020.  On 13Apr2021 He reported it to the doctor and he told the patient to skip a dose of Lisinopril that sometimes it can have those symptoms of a deep nonproductive cough. He skipped the medication, and it hasn&#39;t gotten better. He thinks it is from the COVID vaccine.  At the peak of his cough, he probably had 6 days where he coughed uncontrollably for 24 hours in a day.  He still has a cough.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pneumonia. The doctor didn&#39;t do a chest X-ray or COVID test.

                                                First: April 25~27: Sore Arm, similar to a bruised muscle. Second: April 27 my right forehead just below the hairline and in the right ear area where the top of the ear meets the head, had minor itching and were turning red. On April 28. Hives began on my left arm&#39;s lower wrist and in the general area of my right leg&#39;s knee. The hives became more numerous in these areas until a general red rash condition was appearing  between them as well. By Saturday Morning May 1 the knee and wrist areas were noticeably red like a rash and hives were also appearing with itching below the right knee on the upper half of my shin, above this knee, on my right lower wrist and on my left lower fore arm.  My right ear was starting to swell at just the top. I tried putting Gold Bond Medicated Powder on these areas, but it didn&#39;t reduce the itching much.      Sunday May 2, I called my mom who is a Registered Nurse about this. She advised going to my health care provider to substantiate these symptoms. Monday May 3 I visited my health care provider&#39;s office after work and got an appointment for Tuesday at 10:15 from a cancellation. One of their RN&#39;s looked at my hives and rashes. New hives had now also formed on my left leg just below the knee on the back side. It was a red string of itching a couple inches long. I called my boss Tuesday so I could take the day off for the appointment and he agreed that I should do  this. At the doctor&#39;s office, PA-C after extensive questioning and examination said he thought this was an allergic reaction possibly related to the polyethylene content of the vaccination. He further advised that I not get the second shot until I was checked by an allergist. He put in a referral for this. I think I picked up cold-like symptoms (sore throat and cough) from the doctor&#39;s office that were minor.      Wednesday morning I had much worse symptoms. I was weak, groggy, couldn&#39;t think without great effort, was more itchy, and my right knee was starting to ooze. I called my boss at work to take the day off since I was quite sure driving would be risky, and that I would have to leave work early for lack of energy. My right front thigh had a new area of hives along with my right and left fore arms. I started treating all my affected areas with Caladryl topical Analgesic and taking generic Benedryl. I had breakfast and then slept until 2:30 PM, had lunch and slept until evening. By then my forehead and right ear areas had reduced in severity. I had lost (2) days of work. The rest of the week, all my symptoms diminished. As of this writing Sunday May 9, my knee is still tender, sore, and red, and left wrist hives are still pronounced.

A 63-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm on 19Mar2021 10:00 (at the age of 63 years old) as 1st dose, single &#34;to get myself vaccinated&#34;. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient called about the COVID 19 vaccine, stated that he had side effects that he felt he needed to report and questioned if he needed to know anything before getting the second dose. He stated that he received the first dose on 19Mar2021 and on Sunday (21Mar2021) he began to have symptoms. He stated on Sunday 21Mar2021, he had swelling on his neck and cheek and stuffiness in his ear which he thought might had been a tooth ache or an allergic reaction. He stated that a few days after those symptoms developed he had pain on the right side of his face on 21Mar2021 and markings that showed up on his face on 22Mar2021. Further stated that he went to the urgent care as there was no need to go to the emergency room on 25Mar2021 and was diagnosed with shingles. He began treatment that day for shingles on his right side of his face and it was a seven day course of medication and his last treatment will be finished at the end of that day of the report. He reported that the markings were better and he did not have nerve pain and the sore dried up on his face which was consistent. He went to the doctor on 29Mar2021 just to be on the safe side and the symptoms seemed to be better. He received the next vaccine on 09Apr2021. Further stated he thought it would be good to report his symptoms and see if there was anything Pfizer could tell him. Further stated that the scabbing on unspecified date was getting better. Treatment was valacyclovir. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all of the events. The outcome of the event tooth ache and allergic reaction were unknown; pain right side of the face was resolved on 29Mar2021; stuffiness in ear, swelling on neck and cheek were recovered on 31Mar2021; shingles and marking that showed up on the face were recovering.

Arm was still sore when second injection was received on 5/5/2021. Upper arm area around injection area is still very sore. Sharp pains are a constant. Pain makes a sound sleep almost impossible at night. Pain disrupts sleep and must put my arm above my head to help lesson the pain. I will be making an appointment to my primary health care provider in near future.

                                                Zoster lesions appeared on 6/5/2021 on my left arm...same arm used for both Covid vaccine injections...about six weeks out from second dose.  I had prodromal symptoms for few days before rash appeared.  As the appearance of the shingles rash occurred on a weekend, I was seen by MD at an Urgent Care Center to get started on antivirals asap. She prescribed Valacyclovir 1gm TID for 7 days orally and Mometasone 0.1% cream topically to lesions BID.

Chest, back of right arm, back of left knee, bicep of right arm. Then 5 days and 10 hours, 6-13-2021, 10pm, I got achy, followed by the chills and then a fever.  Lasted for 2 hrs, then the fever lasted longer into the night.  What concerns me is the rash/bumps in different places and then the delayed symptoms. With this being the 1st shot, I do not think I will fair well with a 2nd shot.

Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room.

He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep.

He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number.

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday the 12th. On Sunday the 14th I noticed that I had a sort of &#34;wound&#34; in my left lower back. It was causing me some pain when the tip of my backpack touched the area. On Tuesday the 16th I visited the doctor who gave me the news that I had shingles. He discovered that it was actually spreading a little bit more around the original that I saw on Sunday. I&#39;m already on medication for that.

                                                Had slightly red,slightly itchy,sore area at the injection site about as big around as a silver dollar.Using my other hand to rub that spot,I could feel a lump deep under the skin,about the same size.Those symptoms seemed to worsen over about 3days then started tapering off.On the morning of day 7 (today) the redness &amp; soreness has seemingly diminished and only a very slight noticeable lump remains &amp; I expect that will soon go away also.Was only annoying &amp; not bad enough to cause me any alarm.Friends told me it was&#34;Covid Arm&#34;(vaccine arm), &amp; it was happening in some patients, esp.those that had already recovered from the virus.I had tested positive for Covid-19 in early December and recovered  about 3 wks later.

                                                Two reactions, one severe, one moderate.  Moderate: My arm  starting hurting three days after the first shot, a dull pain at the site of the jab. The dull pain has not gone away. I can feel it right now as I type  this. Severe: One week after the first shot, my varicose vein  problems re-emerged. I had vein surgery in 2018, and my problems vanished until the first shot. My calf muscle swelled and became very painful; my lower leg was covered with black and blue bruises; my varicose veins reappeared. These problems diminished slowly throughout February. I saw a specialist at the Vein Clinic in March, who determined that I needed additional surgery this summer. My leg has almost returned to normal, but I have intermittent heaviness in the calf muscle and pain in the quads, like a weaker version of what I had before the first vein surgery in 2018.  Additional comments: I had a bout of powerful fatigue following the first shot. I slept 14 hours straight the day after getting it. For the second shot, the fatigue was less severe, coming in waves. However, I felt weak for more than two months, which I noticed since I go to the gum regularly. My strength has still not returned to where it was previously.

It has never hurt without a reason before. It has continued to hurt ever since (47 days). That was the only side effect I had other than a sore upper left arm (several days). Nothing changed after my second shot (lot #EP7533) on 4/11 (just a sore upper left arm again for several days). The pain has spread to the inside/underside of my wrist in the last week or so.

                                                He got the vaccine on a Friday, and felt sore after. On Monday he still felt pain on his back, but thought it was because of the vaccine.  He also felt warm and itchy on his back and under arm as well. It started as a small patch that looked like a rash, and was very painful and itchy. By the end of the week he decided to go to the doctor because he couldn?t take the pin anymore and it was spreading and blistering.  He was given Ibuprofen, and acyclovir ointment. The second visit on April 5th they gave him Gabapentin 100 mg.

I went to the doctor a week after the Pfizer 2nd dose and he told me to take Benadryl. I did and it went away for a few days but it came back after a week. I have had hives on my chest and underarms  for about two weks now. Today, I have a hives again and my upper lip is swollen.  Where should  I go for something like this?  I was vaccinated at CVS with my second dose about a month ago. I am 64 and I think I had an anaphilactic reaction to shrimp about 38 years ago.        Thank you,

A 64-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Mar2021, 6 days after the Covid 19 vaccine, the patient developed shingles. Physician doesn&#39;t think it was related to the Covid 19 vaccine. Physician prescribed the patient with valaciclovir (VALTREX) and a cream as the shingles were extensive on the patient&#39;s abdominal wall. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 06Apr2021 and physician was asking if it&#39;s ok for the patient to proceed in getting the second Covid 19 vaccine on that day or does the vaccine need to be delayed and if it needs to be delayed how long can it be delayed. Physician doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a reaction, she just wants to know how long she can delay the patient getting the second Covid 19 vaccine. The patient developed the shingles on 22Mar2021 but the patient didn&#39;t see the doctor until today so he&#39;s had the shingles about 10 days. Does the patient go ahead and get the second dose or delay. Physician would like to know how many days you can delay getting the second Covid 19 vaccine. Physician doesn&#39;t think the rash is from the Covid 19 vaccine she thinks it&#39;s just a coincidence. Patient was in the office exam room. Physician would just like the question answered as the patient in the office. No further information was provided or obtained. Outcome of the event was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are completed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Event represents an intercurrent medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2 .

I took acetaminophen and the itch from my arm goes away for a few hours but the itch from my head continues to bother me. On my head I tried the clobesol and it&#39;s good for less than an an hour. when it start to itch again, I washed my head with just water then tried Vicks Vaporub to freshen the head and the itch will go away for awhile.

                                                He got his vaccine, he had the localized pain for a day or two.  Then about the 3rd day he noticed the pain was still there and when he holds the phone for a long time talking he starts feeling the pain.  Also when he&#39;s laying down on the left arm after a while it starts hurting and he has to turn over to get rid of the pain, and this happens all the time and when he&#39;s laying down every night he has the pain.  He cannot hold his phone in his left hand for a long time due to the pain.  The pain is localized around the injection site itself.  He has a friend that is having the exact same symptoms as well.  He has not taken anything for the pain/reaction or called his doctor.   This has been going on for almost 2 months and wonders if he has a blockage in that arm.   This pain wakes him up at night and he has to switch locations in order to get rid of the pain.

A 64-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17May2021 (at the age of 64-year-old, Batch/Lot Number: EW0177) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included was walking pneumonia twice and other than that just a typical flu. The patient races dirt bikes so he was tough. Also, he had carpel tunnel from his job, and he had left over pain pills from that, and he had been taking them to help reduce the pain since he cannot really do anything about his side effects. Concomitant medication included pain pills, no other products reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 26Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0162) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and on an unspecified date in Apr2021, experienced muscle stiffness and soreness that was in left arm and around his buttocks and his thighs and reported felt soreness for a few days afterward. This report is not related to study or programme. It was reported that, honestly, he wishes he never got it because he cannot do anything. He was on the fence about getting it since we are at the end of the pandemic and the hospitals are not as overwhelmed anymore. Everyone thinks that he was still in his 50&#39;s, he was very healthy, and he has no medical or health issues and he works out all the time, which was why he was so concerned about why it was affecting him like this. He has had his second dose of the COVID vaccine, and he wanted to report what was going on with his body. It was reported that, then he got the 2nd dose and within a day or two he was sore, and he was at the 11th day of experiencing this. He was sore and tight on his upper body like his chest, both arms, his shoulder blades, biceps, triceps, lower neck muscles and on his shoulder blades behind him. He had his 2nd dose not last Monday but the Monday before that. It did dissipate during the day. He jokingly said it was like the Pfizer vaccine retreats and hides during the day. Because of this he has had no decent sleep for the last few nights. His shoulder aches like someone took a bat and hit it. It feels like that on his left arm too but a little less pain. He was a side body sleeper, and he cannot sleep on his side because of this so then he ends up sleeping on his back with his mouth wide open which then makes him dehydrated of course. he has no energy, and the pain was like it was hitting a nerve where he barely can pick up 5 pounds. This was an extending issue and he just wanted to report and see if anyone else has had this before. The hospital said that they have not had anyone else report this before. It was slowly dissipating but he did not understand why it reinforces itself in the evening. Yesterday, he had to go service a customer and he was moving so slow and had lower back and thigh tightness. His upper body was sore and tight so when he got home, he was walking around trying to get his blood flowing and stretching some but then in the middle of the night those reserves came out and he gets attacked. The stiffness, soreness and pain were all concentrated mostly on his upper body. Also, his neck pops and he has never had that happen before. He looked it up and it looks like it was something with air in his bloodstream or something and when he rotates his head and looks around it makes a pop sound, and it has been doing it ever since his 2nd shot. He says this started probably on 18May2021 right after the vaccine. The patient clarified that for the side effects after his second dose that began soon after the COVID vaccine and he states that it was like all hell broke loose. This has gotten a little bit better but not a lot. Maybe 10% better or maybe 15% better. As he was sitting there his shoulder area on the right side was a little bit in pain. He feels like he was 80 years old, he was walking slow, and his body was stiff. No further details provided on the pain pills. He says he was flexing his bicep and he has some pain and there was pain in his triceps. He also has pain between those muscles, it hurts. It was maybe where he had the COVID vaccine. He also has this same pain on the left side except his bicep doesn&#39;t hurt but his tricep does and it hurts from his elbow down to his shoulder and it aches. On a scale of 1-10 his pain was at a 3-4 but at night it was worse. The patient and health care professional consent to be contacted was reported as yes. Investigation assessment was reported as no. The outcome of the events Sleep deficit, oral disorder, dehydration, hypokinesia, feeling abnormal was unknown and for all other events recovering.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain.

A 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history included Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday 14Jan2021. He felt great after receiving the injection, then got a cough and fever. On 18Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he was around someone who was positive for COVID-19. On Friday 22Jan2021 he reported having chills, no fever, body aches and a slightly productive cough. On Sunday 24Jan2021 he checked his temperature and it was 99.5 F. He he took two tylenol and he had not had a fever since that time. Between Friday 22Jan2021 and today (25Jan2021) he had multiple (4) COVID-19 tests that all returned negative. He went to the doctor yesterday morning (24Jan2021) and started on steroids and an antibiotic. He was also reporting that his face was red this morning (25Jan2021) when he woke up. He wanted to know if he continued to be negative for COVID and these were side effects from the vaccine can he still received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by someone that if take a &#39;Regeneron Infusion for COVID&#39; then he would have to wait 90 days to receive the next dose of vaccine, he asked was that true? He wanted to know if it&#39;s possible to have side effects a week after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He asked &#34;Let&#39;s say I end up testing positive for COVID, do I still get the second dose of the vaccine? Let&#39;s say I do have COVID-19 that means I would have antibodies from that and then I would have antibodies from the first dose of the vaccine so would that mean that I&#39;m covered and protected from COVID then?&#34; He had taken a few Covid tests and all come back negative. Caller was wondering if this was just his body reacting to the vaccine. On 18Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he came into contact with someone with Covid and on 22Jan2021 he took the Covid test. He said that he had chills that night 22Jan2021 and the next day 23Jan2021. He was told by the doctor to get the PCR test. He took the test in the morning and it tested negative 23Jan2021. That night he had someone came by his house and he took the test at 18:00 and took the test again at 20:00 at his doctors office. He said that all of the tests were negative. He said that he was testing so much so he could take the cocktail. The doctor prescribed Doxycycline Hyclate to take twice a day and prescribed Dexamethasone 6mg. He stated that his symptoms chills on Friday and Saturday and he had the start of a cough. He said that he had little aches on Saturday, but they were gone later that day. On Sunday morning (24Jan2021), he was prescribed these 2 things and by 11:00 had a fever of 99.5. The cough was not bad, and he had no aches. He took 2 Tylenol. He said that he took his temperature from 16:00 24Jan2021 Sunday until now, and he had no fever anymore. He would feel a little something in his cough, but it was getting better he said probably because of the medications. He stated that he got tested for strep, but had not received the results. He said that today his face got very red and it was red for about 1.5 hours, but was fine now.  He said that he wanted to know, Does the vaccine have some of the antibodies working at this moment? Due for his second dose 04Feb2021, if keeps testing Negative and the symptoms didn&#39;t come back does he still get the vaccine on 04Feb2021? If he does have Covid and has no symptoms does he take his vaccine on 04Feb021? If he tests positive and takes the Regeneron cocktail, does he have to postpone the the 2nd dose for 90 days? The outcome of events was unknown.  information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Pt is s/p liver transplant in May 2012 on chronic immunosuppression medication. He received first dose of Covid vaccine on 1/29/2021. On routine labs on 2/5/2021, LFTs were significantly elevated from baseline -  ALT 123 (27), AST 66 (21), Alkaline Phosphate 242 (127), Total bilirubin 2.8 (0.3), Direct bilirubin 1.9 (&lt;0.2). He did report new full body itching the day before. As a result of elevated labs, the patient presented to the emergency room due to concerns for biliary obstruction versus graft rejection. Repeat liver function tests were still elevated, although slightly better. Abdominal US was normal, no signs of dilatation or obstruction with patent vasculature. Pt was admitted to the inpatient transplant unit overnight and labs repeated on 2/6 showed continued improvement. With this, pt was continued on the same immunosuppressive med regimen and discharged home with close outpatient transplant follow-up.

Symptoms remain 48 hours after injection.  I run at night, usually 3 miles or more.  7 hours after injection no problem running. 31 hours after injection running was much more difficult, similar to fatigue.

                                                Slight soreness in left arm around and just below the point of injection.  This went away around 6PM on Tuesday, the day after the injection.  For about 2 hours around 10PM until I went to sleep on Monday night (the night of the injection), I had a slight fever but it was only slight.  I had a more intense fever (though for only 30 minutes) the evening that I had my flu shot last October when I visited my doctor for a check up, so I would definitely categorize the fever from the COVID-19 shot as very slight.  It was gone when I woke up in the morning.  After I woke up, I was a bit nauseous, but it was so slight (and I have not been nauseous for well over a year) that it took me awhile to actually recognize it as being nauseous.  This lasted for 15-20 minutes and then it disappeared.  On Wednesday morning, my heart went into an irregular heartbeat that felt different than what I feel when it goes into an irregular heartbeat.  I have no idea if there is any relation between receiving the vaccine and getting an irregular heartbeat but I thought I should report it.  I have recovered from all symptoms from the vaccination except the irregular heartbeat.  I put down as &#34;unknown&#34; if I have recovered  from the adverse events as I don&#39;t know if going into an irregular heartbeat was in any way related to the vaccination.

Used Albuterol inhaler twice, 5 minutes apart, and took Prednisone 20 mg orally.  Within 60-90 minutes, symptoms completely resolved and did not reoccur.  He did not seek medical attention at the time of this reaction, but called this office on 3/11/2021 so that the reaction could be documented.  That prompted today&#39;s office visit and the completion of this VAERS form.  Patient does have monthly allergy injections, but last injection was on 2/23/2021.

                                                This could be purely a coincidence, but 18 days ( on 03/07/2012) after my first injection on 02/17/2021 I started having some pain, burning and tingling under and around my right arm. Note the first injection was in the left arm. I saw my doctor 2 days later for a normally scheduled appointment. He said he thought I had aggravated a nerve  and that i should get a Shingles vaccine as soon as I could after I finished the Covid Vaccine. I received the second dose on 03/11/2012 and then the day on 03/12/2021 i began breaking out with Shingles.  Again this is probably purely a coincidence but I thought I should report it just in case.

No fever, and vitals were OK. 800 mg Ibuprofen and Norco did not ease the pain. It was unbearable. Was tested for Covid and Strep, and both came back negative. I called my Primary Care physician and the local ER. All they said to do was to hydrate. Went to urgent cacre...no help. Lingering fatigue for another week. Finally after two weeks, the symptoms subsided. Second Dose. Same kind of pain on second day, but seems to be subsiding...so far. But, my injection site is very sore, swollen, and red. Does not seem to be getting better 5 days out.

                                                A couple of days after the vaccine, back muscle (upper back, left side- the same arm of vaccination) started hurting. Since then, the pain is constantly there BUT it moves to various locations, only on the left side, sometimes in muscles, sometimes in shoulder joint and often at the site of vaccination. The pain, while it moves around, is only at one location, often in addition to the vaccination site. Thus it can be in left shoulder joint and the site. Or it could be the site and at the shoulder- neck joint. Never has the pain migrated to the right side and is confined to the left arm, shoulder, upper back area. Naturally the pain dulls upon taking a couple of Tylenol?s or Advil?s but otherwise has been there no -stop for about two weeks, shortly after the  vaccination. Avery slight swelling can be felt at the injection site.

More accumulation 8 days later.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient.   A 65-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 65-years-old) for COVID19-immunization.  The patient medical history included allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), and levofloxacin.  Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included: ibuprofen (ADVIL), paracetamol (TYLENOL), multivitamin, turmeric, and krill oil.  The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 on 22Jan2021 (Lot Number: Unknown; at the age of 65-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced red bumps now in groups of 2-3 on my chest, back, arms, and legs. more accumulation 8 days later. No treatment was received for the adverse event. The patient had not recovered from the event, red bumps now in groups of 2-3 on my chest, back, arms, and legs. more accumulation 8 days later.

                                                Starting 4 days  after second shot, I developed extensive rashes on multiple areas of my body.  The rashes appear to be controlled by Benadryl.  Also started taking Prednisone on 3/22/2021 at 12:30  PM.  At this point (1:00 PM) I have taken 5 doses of Prednisone 10 mg each.  The rashes subside within 2 hours of taking 2 tablets of Benadryl, but reappear around 5 hours of taking Benadryl.  Rashes typically on same body parts, but in different areas.  Rashes still present today.

Ear and Face were swollen, warm to touch, painful and could not hear.  I am still having difficulty hearing in that ear (3-25-2021), sounds like liquid in that ear.  I called a tele doc service on Sunday, 02/14/2021, they prescribed Amoxicillin -Clav.  Temperature and swelling went away, still having difficulty hearing in that ear.

                                                About a month after my second Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine I experienced an episode of hives.  Since then, I have had four other hives events.  My skin turns very red, my skin feels hot internally, and it is somewhat itchy.  It resolves itself after 45-75 minutes.  It does happen after I eat something.   But, I have not been able to determine which if any food is the cause.  And all of the foods that I&#39;m consuming I have for quite some time.  For example, I have been eating dark chocolate almost daily for many years without a problem.  Last week, I hadn&#39;t eaten for several hours.  When I returned to my car , I ate a small piece of dark chocolate, and soon after I experienced a hives event.  I have never ever had hives in my life so I am assuming that it is an immune response resulting from the vaccine.

                                                fever; Aches and pains all over body; Right arm soreness at injection site; Severe chills; too tired and too chilled; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical information team. A  male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0158, Expiration date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Apr2021 at 10:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: ER2613, Expiration date: 31Jul2021), via intramuscular route of administration in left arm on 23Mar2021 at 11:45 am as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included  diagnosed on Jul2016, colonoscopy on 07Apr2021. Patient had no family history. The patient concomitant medications included supplements. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of the suspect vaccine. The patient stated he had no reaction to the first dose of the vaccine and after the second dose on tuesday (13Apr2021 at 21:00) and had chills when he went to bed that night.  He went to bed that night with severe chills. On 14Apr2021 at 09:00, the next morning, he had a fever of 101 and aches and pains all over his body. Earlier, about a half hour before shot, he had a COVID test because he had a procedure today to give birth to a kidney stone  which was cancelled due to fever aches and pains.  He previously had COVID test and they all came ack negative.  The procedure had to be cancelled. Today, he went back in to get another COVID test. He will know results within a couple of hours or before tomorrow whether it comes back positive or not. He does not believe the vaccine gave him COVID, but will find out when the test is tomorrow. He asked if the second dose is the same as the first dose. He said he has been reading and it is essentially the same but depends on the person that dilutes it and the temperature it is at. After verbal response he stated the second shot was definitely building a strong immune response. It was reported that first shot primes the immune system, helping it recognize the virus, and the second shot strengthens the immune response. Chills were gone by wednesday gone but still had a fever and aches and pains. He was too tired and too chilled to take his temperature tuesday night. He has a hazardous material thermometer. He called his urologist that night and said he may need to reschedule procedure tomorrow which is today. The fever improved during day but at night it crept back up to 101 and this morning is 98. His pulse ox is 98%. This morning other than feeling stiff for sleeping 16 hours, he has a couple of aches and pains this morning, but they are gone now. He was diagnosed with this kidney stone for 4 years. It is a bladder stone and his urologist said it is a nuisance stone. Once he got where insurance would cover it, he said lets take care of it. It was diagnosed Jul2016 and it was prescheduled to get it removed. Patient had a colonoscopy that was prescheduled. It was 15 years since he had one. He kind of wondered if the doses are different. He wanted to know if the second dose was a little more powerful. He takes supplements but does not think any would be relevant. Taking same supplement with first dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test: negative on 23Sep2020, 05Apr2021 before Colonoscopy and last test was 13Apr2021 two days prior to when he was going to have kidney stone removed. He had an additional one done today and does not have results yet. The outcome of the event fever was recovering, too tired was unknown and rest all events was recovered on 2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

The pain, etc., has lasted for over a month although things have subsided significantly over the past week. I am a strong advocate for vaccinations and understand this may be a coincidence, but the timing does seem a bit suspicious and that&#39;s why I am reporting it.

                                                I felt burning sensation as I was being injected with the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I noticed that,  the strength  of the burning sensation corresponded to the amount being injected into my arm. I asked the person administering the shit, whose name I was told , why did it burn and didn?t burn  when I had the first dose of the same vaccine? Her answer while she was smiling: ?it is the alcohol I rubbed prior to the injection. Her answer didn?t make sense to me since the burning I felt was not at the same level but rather depended on how much vaccine was being injected. As such it is either the vaccine that  caused the burning or the method of injection used, not the claimed ?alcohol? . The burning dissipated minutes afterwards, and so far I do not show any other symptoms., I do however feel concerned if what I was injected with caused the burning sensation  I felt.

I got the vaccine in the right arm but these are all in the left lower middle arm. Then two more. This went on for a week and then I started to put rubbing alcohol and in the last 3 days I put Antiseptic Iodine solution 10% Now today I have about four more, total about 7 or 8. They are redish and appear to have flesh raw like around the middle. They are about 1/16 to 1/8 inch in size. It is scary and they dont go away and nothing seems to help get rid of them.  I dont know if I should get the 2nd vaccine as is to be done this friday.

This went away after a few hours but when it started I thought of Bell&#39;s Palsy.  - Later my arm got extremely sore at the site of the injection it still hurts and in a large area of the arm 5 days later - Painful area below the left armpit and in an area about 3 inches in diameter (area of the lymph node). Still have pain although less after 4 days.

It is unclear exactly how many minutes into the post-vaccination period passed before he began to report numbness around his lips.  The nurse practitioner then indicated he began a &#34;rash&#34; on the back of his neck.  The recipient reported that this was feeling very much like his previous allergic reactions.  They took his BP and it was reported to be around 180/100 at that time.   He did not report feeling SOB but reported his throat felt like it had in previous allergic reactions.  Recipient remained alert and oriented the entire time.  It was decided by the two nurse practitioners on site that he be given the epinephrine and Benadryl IM.  His BP remained elevated and then, following the epinephrine, he became very shaky and a bit foggy. 911 was then notified for further assistance from the EMT&#39;s and possible evaluation at the local hospital which was about 5 minutes away.  Paramedics evaluated the recipient and agreed that evaluation at the hospital would be warranted.  He never lost consciousness or required oxygen or other assistance. He was able to place himself on the gurney and was speaking with his wife (that was present)as he was taken out the door.  The transfer was done out of an abundance of caution. We do not know if the hospital kept him following the incident.

                                                The patient noted that blood and a &#34;clear liquid&#34; was running down his arm.  He stated that it was 1/16th to 3/32nds inch wide and ran to the level of the elbow. (This occurred while the vaccinator was looking away and disposing of the syringe in the sharps container.)  It was wiped up and pressure was applied to the site without further problem.  Upon reaching home he thought about this and then wondered if he had received a complete dose. He then contacted the health department and I contacted him in follow up. In discussing this with the vaccinee and the vaccinator, NP, her immediate impression was that this was blood only but admits that perhaps a portion of vaccine could have been mixed in as well.  This was discussed with the vaccinee and I feel that greater than half of the vaccine was s\administered so no repeat dose will be given. He will return for his 2nd dose in 21-42 days.

Went to the ER to get treated. I was medicated with different antihistamines. And I was observed for five hours. The swelling of the glands didn?t go down some what. But I am still itchy not as drastic as it was yesterday Monday, March 1 of 2021. But my body is still itchy. Medication?s are Benadryl, famotidine,  and prednisone. I will be seeing my family doctor this afternoon as a follow up from yesterday because I am still itchy most around my body.  No fever, no bodyaches, but the itching Has not some subsided.

                                                On 02/12/2021 around 11:00am I was assigned to have Covid 19 shot at the table#6. At that time I saw the Vaccine was already in the syringe which was in the plastic bag with zipper. Ten days after the shot I felt well, no pain nor swell on my left shoulder. But in the morning of 02/23/2021 after waking up I started to feel hurt to my left arm and the pain was transmitted to the left of my back (left lung). During these 3 days 23,24,25 my pain reached the maximum intensity 10/10 even I took 3 times a day Ibuprofen which was each time 2x200mg. On 02/26/2021 I went to Hospital in the Emergency Unit and after diagnosis the Doctors found that I had 3 heart arteries clog-up. How can I be sure that the liquid in the syringe is the Pfizer Vaccine or something else? I used to see the TVs broadcast on the Covid 19 shot that the nurse inserts the syringe in the small Pzifer bottle, suck the Vaccine into syringe and inject  the vaccine into the shoulder of the patient. Can CDC require that all Covid 19 providers show the vaccine to all patients before the shot? In 2017 I had an Angiogram and my 3 bypasses were not clogged why they are all clogged now? I don&#39;t change my every day diet and I&#39;m very careful with eating fat, cholesterol and salt in my everyday food.

                                                I received the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination on the morning of 2/17/21 with no resulting initial sequelae other than injection site tenderness. Approximately 2 weeks post-injection, I developed coryzal symptoms of nasal stuffiness and congestion without fever, chills, headache, or myalgias. On, or about, 3/3/21, I noticed diminution of hearing in the left ear without signs of drainage, fever, or dizziness. This was treated with a Z Pac, nasal and oral decongestants, and nasal steroids. Over the course of 10 days, the hearing decline had improved, but a clinical exam and testing by an ENT on 3/12/21 confirmed evidence suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, with asymmetric impairment in the affected (left) ear.

Rash did NOT go to face nor mucous membranes (pictures available). Large itchy welts that responded to diphenhydramine 125mg - 175mg (25mg - 50mg per dose) PO per day, which gradually tapered over two (2) weeks. On day 3, took 12mg dexamethasone PO on advice of ER physician. Both diphenhydramine and dexamethasone resolved rash but interesting to note that when diphenhydramine wore off, itchiness, then welts, returned. Learned to take diphenhydramine at first sign of itchiness. Have never experienced such an allergic reaction before, and this was the first time taking diphenhydramine and dexamethasone for such a condition for me. Also, discontinued prescription medications about one week into rash just in case. Restarted medications a few days before complete remission with no adverse consequences (so current medications as a cause were ruled out). Also, took famotidine 40mg PO during last week that also seemed to help a little  but this may have been due to slow resolution of adverse reaction.

This consumer reported events for two doses. This is the first of two doses.  A 66-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), intramuscular, administered in the left arm, on 16Jan2021 at a single dose (at the age of 66-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medication. The patient had &#34;no problem&#34; with his first COVID-19 shot.  A week after his first COVID-19 vaccine dose, he had itching around his waist. He thought he may have had a spider bite, because he had been working around an area that had hatched black widow spider eggs. While he was at an appointment with his urologist, his urologist said the spot on his waist looked like shingles. He had 1 spot on his waist. The spot was a circle that turned black, and had a lot of dark spots, like bruises around the black circle. He was putting on cream on the spot on his waist and has gone away slowly. His blood work was &#34;OK, and there was nothing negative&#34;. The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021194671 Same patient, same drug with different vaccine dose, different AE

Also I noted that the 2nd covid-19 dose recorded on the15th of March is identical to the one I received  on February 22, 2021, leading me to believe that the person who administrated the second shot simply copied the lot number information from the first shot that was recorded on card.

Instead of using the muscle  of the upper arm , she injected me almost at the top my shoulder, hitting bone.  The injection site was more than two inches above the 1st injection, when I had zero side effects.  Side effects for the second injection were 1) extreme soreness at injection site 2) bruising 3) extreme headache and 4) chills.  All symptoms have diminished, though not entirely, as I fill out this form (March 25th, 2021 04:00 p.m.)

I assumed it was just temporary and didn&#39;t mention it.  But it has continued off and on since the time of my 2nd vaccination almost 2 weeks ago.  I feel it for a few seconds to perhaps a minute or so, then it&#39;s gone for a while.  This repeats multiple times throughout the day.   I have had no other side effects from the vaccination, no temperature of flu-like symptoms.

                                                After getting the vaccine on March 27, 2021, on March 31 I noticed a rash across both shoulders. It was itchy red bumps. In the following days it got progressively worse spreading down the arms, chest and back. I called Dr.  on Monday April 5 and saw him at 3:45 pm that afternoon. He did not know what was causing the rash. He performed a biopsy and sent it off to be tested and prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP .1% to be used twice daily to the arms, chest and back. The rash has continued to spread downwards but may be showing signs of slowing down this morning. Will be able to tell more tomorrow.

A 66-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9262) (at the age of 66-years-old) as 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes from 1998 and ongoing and ongoing blood thinner. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for anticoagulant therapy from Sep2019 and ongoing. The patient previously took warfarin, the patient took it only once a day. The doctor changed it to Eliquis. On 29Jan2021, the patient blood sugar has been lower in the mornings and soreness at injection site. The patient doesn&#39;t over his starches or anything. He has had no bad feelings from that. He was okay with it. Having a lower blood sugar was better than having a high one. The patient got the vaccine because he wants to live. He also got it because he was diabetic and high risk. He doesn&#39;t want to take changes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood sugar was 130 (normal blood sugar is around 130 in the mornings) on unknown date, on 29Jan2021, it is 97 and 108 (Blood sugar decreased. Despite the number of starches, he eats) and A1C on 28Jan2021 was 5.5 (which was good for him as a diabetic). The outcome of the events was unknown.

However unfortunately within 13 minutes of receiving the vaccine she started to experience a and irritation of the tongue/throat with tingling sensation followed by throat hoarseness, a cough and a red face.  She was experiencing a little bit of chest tightness in addition to a little bit of shortness of breath and therefore used her albuterol inhaler.  Shortly thereafter her red face improved.  EMS was called to the scene however by the time they arrived she was improving and was sent home.  She took a Benadryl at home later in the evening and the following day on Friday she started Pepcid daily since that time. She states since the vaccine she has felt poorly describing exhaustion and feeling achy all over with continued raw throat.  She has not warranted use of her albuterol inhaler since last Thursday and ran out of Benadryl Thursday evening only utilizing Pepcid daily and continues on her other medications. She reports a history of allergies to petroleum products including polyethylene glycol which is suspected to be the cause of her allergic reaction

A 66-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EP6955) on 18Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blocked artery that can&#39;t put a stent. None family medical history. None other vaccines administered on same date. Last vaccines were 50 years ago as a child and there were no issues. After his first dose, patient was asked to sit for 15 minutes and he was fine and got in the car and drove home which takes 5-7 minutes and by the time he got home, he had a big old puffy bag under his right eye which drew his attention to look in the mirror and he saw his face was swelling. It started under his right eye and his left eye is a little bit swollen and then on the side coming down to his nose and all the way down on his cheek, lymph nodes are swollen on both sides as well. He went to the pharmacist and they told him they don&#39;t recommend him taking anything so he left it alone thinking it would be gone when he woke up. His daughter asked him called an ambulance, so he did that at 2:00-3:00a.m. When they came they said that there is no swelling any other place, they could recommend to take Benadryl, following morning he got the tablets and has taken all 24 and it is still there. No emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included high blood pressure and cholesterol both from an unknown date. The patient had known allergies. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number was not reported), administered in left arm on 28Jan2021 06:00 PM (at the age of 66-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Concomitant medications included losartan potassium (LOSARTIN); rosuvastatin; alfuzosin; and potassium; all were taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. A month after 2nd dose, started having daily fever with fatigue and dry harsh cough. This has continued for 4 weeks and in third week developed severe bilateral edema feet and legs. Then, the calf skin turned red, hot and tender; all on 12Mar2021 14:00 (as reported). All medical reports have come back normal and doctors were unable to diagnose the root cause which is why the patient suspected the Pfizer COVID vaccine may have caused this adverse reaction. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized for 5 days. Therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events as patient received Tylenol, Antibiotic and steroid. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On 5/8/2021 I was stung by a wasp. I have always had a very mild response to bee/wasp or other insect bites. This was initially the same with little or no swelling or redness at the site (my left index finger). However, the next day I noticed red bumps on my arms. The rash continued to develop spreading across my entire body including palms and bottom of feet. It persisted for six days before resolving.  I took benedryl  and it had an effect on the itching but no impact on reducing the rash.   As this is a significant change in immune response from historical, and it was within 2days of the second Covid shot, this potential to increased immune activity to wasp venom should be considered. What if I was already sensitive? Would it move to anaphylaxis?

Subject did not know of pain origin, but assumed he may have strained muscles and did not seek treatment.  However at 2am on 4/24/21, subject awakened with itching/hot feeling to left knee and hip, and noted a &#34;splotchy rash that looked like poison oak at first&#34;.  Stated that he &#34;googled shingles and it looked exactly like those picture&#34;.  He phoned a friend on the morning of 4/24/21 who had recently had shingles, and obtained the friend&#39;s medication for shingles and began taking around 6pm on 4/24/21 (Valcyclovir 500mg po QD x 15 days).  He also applied calamine lotion to the rash.  He did continue to work as per scheduled and did not have issues with disability, but at night complains that rash is itchy and burning.  Completed valcyclovir dosage on 5/9/21.  With the use of valcyclovir and calamine, the rash had &#34;dried up&#34; within two weeks, but noted a new rash on right forearm beginning on 5/11/21 and also noted new rash (same as before) starting around the scabs of the old rash on left knew and left hip.  Currently, complaint of itching and burning at rash sites &#34;at bedtime, but doesn&#39;t bother me when my mind is active&#34;.  Has not yet sought professional medical evaluation or treatment, but plans to go to emergency department or urgent care center once he has completed a home improvement project.

A 66-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021 at 19:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0161; Expiration Date: Jul2021) at 0.3 as single dose (at 66 years of age) on the Top of left shoulder blade for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history that was ongoing included sarcoidosis, lupus, congestive heart failure, vein insufficiency, valve failure and leuko vasculitis. Medical history also included 2 heart attacks, sepsis, cellulitis, autoimmune disorder and flu symptoms. Concomitant medication included ongoing hydroxychloroquine taken for autoimmune disorder, patient had been on for 2 and a half years before COVID-19 started. Past drugs included unspecified immunizations, at least 9 different ones and he got severely sick. He had not had COVID 19. He thought maybe he had COVID 19 in Jan when he had some flu symptoms. The  vaccine was administered in a clinic and not at a employer Facility. The patient had 3 weeks of difficulty after the first dose. The shot was given in the top left shoulder blade and it felt like she went in his bone and kept digging. He told her she hit bone but she told him it was in the muscle. He had to have a lot of needles and knew they didn&#39;t feel like that. The pain from the shot put him out of the chair and onto the floor/ he came off the table and went to his knees from the pain. The pain was unbearable. He felt fine the next day (20Apr2021). The day after the vaccine when he felt okay he thought maybe the vaccine had shut all his autoimmune issues down. Then the next day it was all downhill as he felt worse and worse. On 21Apr2021, he felt bad, On 22Apr2021, he felt worse. He was in bed for 2 weeks in Apr2021. He was sick and had severe migraines in Apr2021. The second week (after vaccination), in Apr2021, was when his tumors in his joints, fingers, hands, and right elbows began to hurt. The tumors in his fingers and hands from his sarcoidosis were attacked by the vaccine. The attack on his sarcoidosis tumors caused such severe pain. He felt like a hammer had broken his hands. The pain was so bad he was screaming and yelling. He felt worse than flu symptoms. The pain after the vaccine that he felt in his hands was so bad, it was like cancer pain, pain he couldn&#39;t get away from, he thought he was dying, it was hell. It was unbearable. He was shaking his hands all night long. He went to the Emergency Room to get Morphine for the pain. They wouldn&#39;t give him any Morphine, only Tylenol, and he left. He called his rheumatologist and talked to the nurse and told the nurse he was allergic to the vaccine. He was going back to his rheumatologist on 14May2021. He will discuss with them his events with the vaccine attacking his sarcoidosis tumors.  He stated that it was dangerous, it put him under stress and it was bad. He could not go through that again, he was too tired. The patient went to the ER and to a physician&#39;s office. Another week went by, he started feeling good on 08May2021 and 09May2021. He felt good on 10May2021. The migraine was gone before the tumor pain. The outcome of migraine, sarcoidosis tumor pain, and pain from shot/ hit bone was recovered. The outcome of allergic to COVID-19 vaccine, stress, sick and tired was unknown..

At various times after I would become aware I was home, alone, on couch, unable even sit up. On one occasion I determined it was 1437hrs, Tuesday, 08 Feb 2021, and sent two text messages with great difficulty just saying HELP. IT was actually 0237hrs, Monday, 08 Feb 2021. Both HELP messages had been replied with questions about what the problem was. At 1200hrs, Tuesday, 09 Feb 2021 I became lucid again though at first I believed it to be Wednesday, 10 Feb 2021.

Hx of severe recurrent acute sinusitis until the age of 40. Being sheltered in place since Apr 2020.  Beginning Jan 2021 I started experiencing a little yellowish nasal discharge with slight nasal congestion and occasional pressure in the maxillary sinuses. On Jan 21 received the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Because of no improvement with symptomatic treatment of sinusitis, on Feb 3 started Augmentin 500 mg 3 times a day. On Feb 7, symptoms became much worse: fever 38.2C (100.7F), chills, muscle aches but the most troubling symptom was severe (level 8) face pain. Bouts of pain lasted for a few seconds but repeated about every 30 sec. It felt like an electric shock originated in the nasopharynx and extending to the maxillary sinuses. Pain affected both sides of the face but mostly the right side. Additional symptoms: scalp tenderness, neck pain and light stiffness while moving, skin hyperesthesia. On Feb 8, underwent PCR COVID-19 testing, which was negative.  On Feb 12, canceled the 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, rescheduled for Feb 19. Since Feb 14 no pain and fever.  Treatment:  1. Because I had a thought that I may be developed a nasopharyngeal Herpes zoster infection, on Feb 11 I started  Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times a day. 2. Ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times. 3. Augmentin (stopped after 4 days, on Feb 7).

There was no itching, just a rash.  I took 1 Zyrtec allergy pill at bedtime and by the morning (today) the rash was almost gone. Now, 48 hours after vaccination, the rash is gone.

(Temperatures were in the 80&#39;s)  a feeling of nerve irritation under  the skin that moved from place to place.  unsteadiness on my feet, lack of focus, a basic, total shut down. I curled up in fetal position under a pile of covers for 24 hours. Didn&#39;t fully recovery for 3 days  All simptoms hit me more or less simultaneously within 5 minutes, about 12 hours after 2nd covid shot.  Didn&#39;t seek medical attention, just plowed through it.  I imagined a biological warfare agent would have felt like that. &#34;I thought I was gunna DIE!&#34;

Have come down with severe sinus headaches since getting shot. Upper respiratory irritation continues too. No green mucus or bleeding. Some nights I have awoken with my CPAP machine reading 30 APH other nights 0 to 3 APH. Very unusual considering that I&#39;m also on supplemental O2 with the CPAP.  If I was not on the CPAP &amp; O2 during possible vaccine reaction, it could be bad. Still having bad sinus headaches. Cutting down on Propranolol to 20mg per day per my doctors orders.

                                                Shingles; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 67-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in his left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the COVID Vaccine about 10-12 days ago. He got facial shingles about 10 days after getting the vaccine. He has never had shingles before. This was his first dose. He clarifies that he in fact got shingles 5 days after getting the vaccine on 21Jan2021, instead of 10 days after getting the vaccine. He was not going to get treatment but then it got worse. He is on Valtrex 1 Gram three times a day and Mupirocin topical ointment. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                I received the Eli Lilly monoclonal antibody infusion on Feb.  12 after testing positive for COVID-19 on Feb.  10. I received the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 5, and had muscle aches, chills and a cough. I passed out at home on the 10th, cut my forehead, and had to receive stitches. That is when I tested positive for COVID-19. I continued to by symptomatic and opted for the monoclonal infusion. About 5 hours after I received the infusion, I became completely disoriented. I was unable to stand and did know where I was. My wife summoned an ambulance, and I was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. I received fluids intravenously. I was released from the emergency room about 6 hours later.

Take  Allegra to relieve them. No effect. Each day more rashes appear. Discussed with Dr. who recommended I generate a report.  Early am of the 3/5 I had a very fast heart beat that woke me up. It was fast but not pounding. From the moment I work up it lasted around 10 seconds then stopped. Did not repeat. Dr  did not think it was related to the vaccine. A fast heartbeat like this has never happened before.

                                                The patient states that he had a bilateral hand /forearm dermatitis that was getting better when he received his first dose of Pfizer vaccine.  Thereafter in about 24 hours the dermatitis erupted again and he developed hand swelling, redness and itching.  he consulted his physician and was given oral prednisone at 50mg /d for 7 days which calmed the dermatitis.  We reviewed the possibility of his rash erupting again after he receives dose 32--for which he is here today--and the possibility that the previous corticosteroids that he was given might inhibit a full immune response from the vaccine.  He opts to receive the second dose today anyway and it is administered.  This is to report the worsening of the dermatitis after the first dose was given.  He still had remnants of a dermatitis (wrinkled skin, etc)

                                                developed a rash in my back and groin that did not go away; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Feb2021 09:30 AM (at the age of 67-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety and some lactose intolerance. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine; fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC); azelastine hydrochloride, fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA); amlodipine; and atorvastatin calcium (ATORVAS).  The patient previously took lisinopril and experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 22Jan2021 09:30 AM (at the age of 67-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Approximately 5 days after receiving the 2nd Covid 19 vaccine on 15Feb2021 12:00, the patient developed a rash in his back and groin that did not go away until 3 days ago when he was prescribed Prednisone 20 mg (2 a day) by an allergist. Prior to the Prednisone the rash was very persistent and increasing in intensity. The patient didnot know if it had to be with the vaccine, but five days later and did not respond to antihistamines or over the counter ointments for rash. No covid prior vaccination nor covid tested post vaccination. The event resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the event was unknown.    Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Trouble breathing  Narrative:  Patient presented to the ED 2 days after first dose of COVID vaccine  with a pruritic rash as well as trouble breathing. He reported the rash which was  urticarial and quite pruritic was generalized, ranging from his face over his neck  and back. Initially he had little relief from diphenhydramine, but after a second  dose the rash was largerly resolved. Patient denied chest tightness, wheezing,  tongue or lip swelling. He did not report any GI symptoms, fevers, mild myalgias  but only with a slight headache. No loss of taste or spelled sensation. The rash  most prominent on the right forehead raised a suspicion of herpes zoster which  could also cause a headache, but ED provider ruled this out because patient had  received his herpes zoster vaccination. The rash was also not painful although  bilateral and asymmetric. ED physician concluded it to be a mild reaction to the  vaccine. Patient was discharged on H1 and H2 blockers (diphenhydramine and  famotidine)

                                                After the first dose, within a couple of days, purple patches started appearing randomly in my upper thorax, along my arms, across my chest,.  I thought this was a typical &#34;rash&#34;, but they are not. They are not antihistamine responsive, have developed a scaly crust-like surface, resembling psoriasis.  On my face, I developed dry, scaling skin beneath both eyes and on the bridge of my nose.  None of these symptoms have diminished.  I had shot number 1 on March 2, and shot number 2 on March 23.  The purple splotches are as large as 1.25 inches in diameter, but most are smaller than that.  I am a registered pharmacist, and have never seen, nor experienced, anything like this. They itch, they are rough, like mild sandpaper, and they persist,  now going on for about a month.  I am hoping they resolve soon.

Accompanied. by giant hives and rashes. Thick hives. Bizarre shapes and sizes. All over my body. Had CT scan of chest and Sinus - normal. ENT normal. Blood tests including many for sed rate and other blood or infectious related things, all normal. Urine normal. Phlegm and sputum cultures normal. Going to see pulmonary on April 19. Going for second opinion ENT April 7. Chest pains and general body aches and pains and straining pains in mornings four times including this morning. Dermatologist says he has seen hives from vaccine because there is no other cause when so many patients show up with it; however mine are the most extensive, large and thick he has seen. Suggested Claritin and Benadryl and hoped it would go away in time. I am a physical mess and had zero problems before the vaccines. Please contact me immediately I should have come too sooner.

The rash looked like little blisters on top of bumps on my face, with red rash looking spots on back, legs, and chest. The skin on my face started pealing on my face and it burned and itched. Went to see my Pulmonary Doctor first, than Infectious Disease Doctor than Primary Care. I was treated with steroids, creams and inhalers.  Symptoms would get better than repeat for the first month. Still not feeling like I am ok.  Have two more doctors appts. coming up.

A 67-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EK9231; Expiration Date was not reported), via intramuscular route of administration in Arm Right on 23Jan2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostatomegaly, drug hypersensitivity both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included finasteride (FINAS-TERIDE); ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 23Jan2021 12:30, he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient states he felt fine at the clinic after 15 mins and then after he left he felt lightheaded and dizzy and this continued on. Patient says his reaction was about 20 plus minutes after his injection, which he was fine when he got the injection, he became lightheaded and that has kind of continued on. He says it was pretty bad on the first day, then the second day it went away. He says a couple days later it came back, with his heart kind of racing, and he was still experiencing that though it was getting better. This was not something he had be-fore and he feels anxious and body is tight with dizziness. He says he experiences it periodically, and today it was not bad, but yesterday it came back again. He says he was concerned about that, but he hasn&#39;t passed out or anything. He says he went to the doctor and had an EKG and blood work done, which were all ok. He says it has been off and on, and he was kind of very anxious and tense as well, his insides are tight and jittery, sort of. He says he didn&#39;t see that listed as a common side effect. He says he had soreness at injection site, that went away, and he had no fever or any-thing, just the lightheadedness. He says he wants to see about the lightheadedness, if it had been reported by others, since he didn&#39;t notice it as a common reaction, to see what is going on there, since it has been over a week and it hasn&#39;t totally gone away, so he is concerned about having his second dose. Am doing better now. Went to the doctor for tests on 27Jan2021 (Wednesday). Test results were okay. Patient states these are not some of the common side effects he has seen or read about. He would like to know when will his symptoms go away. Patient would like to know if he should receive the second dose that was scheduled in less than two weeks. Patient states he called his doctor had an EKG and blood work done and his tests were negative. The outcome for soreness at injection site was recovered on an unspecified date and for rest events was recovering.

SUBJECTIVE:  I meet acutely with this 67-year-old man, rash starting about 5 days ago now, no prior history, did get COVID shot in the last 2 weeks, no history of shingles.  Applying topical steroids with some good relief.  His only regular medication is pravastatin and aspirin.  No headaches or visual changes.  No F/C. SKIN EXAM:  There is a vesicular rash, patches, right neck area, extending into right trapezial and upper back area, dry, no spreading redness.  Right ear looks fine. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is almost certainly shingles, now 4 to 5 days old, doubt antivirals will help, looks pretty dry, perhaps it was triggered by vaccination.

Also, mobility seems impaired and more pain with certain movements of the shoulder / arm.   Looked this up and discovered uncommon condition relating to vaccination shots called SIRVA (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration).  It?s now 8 days after shot and arm is still quite sore with mobility issues.  I will give it a few more days and if no improvement will seek medical help.

The fevers continued daily until approximately 2/26/2021. 2)  On or about 2/19/2021 I began to show a red spotted rash UNDERNEATH my skin.  The rash covered all my torso up to my neck, my arms to my wrist, and my legs to my ankles.  The rash mostly subsided within about two weeks however to this day I still show some mild traces of this rash on my torso.   Please see continuation page below.                Please see continuation page below.3)  On or about 3/4/2021 I began to notice a ringing in both my years, this has continued continuously 24 hours a day, to this date. It seems to inhibit my hearing acuity.  To this day my hearing seems to be diminishing at noticeable daily rate.   4)  On or about 3/7/2021 I began to notice an impairment in my vision.  This impairment is manifested in both eyes equally as a washed out field of vision making it hard to read and discern fine details. At times I also see some small sparkles in my vision and dark impairments (not floaters) that seem to last up to a few minutes and then disappear. These impairments occur at random times during the day for no apparent reason.  To this day my vision seems to be diminishing at a noticeable daily rate. On 2/19/2021 I received an eye exam and at that time, my vision was normal and was diagnosed as such.

He had pain like headache on the back of my head and my neck and like just some soreness that could be considered medicinal like he had fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, so he know the difference in what he fell from the fibromyalgia and when it is something different and then on my right arm, he got the shot in my left arm the pharmacist said it was better to get it on the non-dominant arm in case you have a problem and he understand that he could get the fatigue but he had just kind of concern about other stuff, neck pain and headache and having symptoms that are just different from my regular fibromyalgia and also that right foot.

I took some Benedril which helped with swelling. that was the most severe after effect. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the vaccine because i had not been anywhere that weekend and had not  put my hands on anything unusual that i don&#39;t normally touch. It only happened to my hands. Other than that i had minor flu like symtoms from the shot,  achiness and slight fatigue feeling. I had an ER doctor look at my hands when i went in today to get help for my bronchitis, which i had some before the covid shot. It got worse on Monday. He perscribed prednisone which has pretty much taken the hand spots away..i was tested negative for covid today(1/19/21) by the way.

A 68-years-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EK5730) in Left arm, intramuscular on 06Jan2021 around 11:00 at SINGLE DOSE to prevent COVID, famotidine, oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 40 mg, 2x/day for gastritis .  Medical history included gastritis, ongoing diabetes (diagnosed 3 years ago), ongoing hyperparathyroidism (diagnosed many, many years ago), ongoing sjogren&#39;s syndrome (diagnosed recently this year), gout from 2010 and ongoing , coronary atherosclerosis from Nov2020 and ongoing, ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (diagnosed many years ago), asthma from 2020 and ongoing , sleep apnoea from 2019 and ongoing, crohn&#39;s disease from 1981 and ongoing, and abdominal pain. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID] (reported he takes aspirin everyday and the aspirin causes him to have some abdominal pain).   The patient was administered with the first dose of the vaccine on 06Jan2021 and after that he developed a rash in the face that was itchy symmetric and bilateral on 08Jan2021. The rash was bilateral and symmetrical. The event was reported serious due to medically significant. Upon transfer, the caller clarifies he did not take steroids for the rash. A few days prior to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, he started taking a new oral medication. So, he doesn&#39;t know if the rash is from the new medication or the vaccine, but he decided to call and report this event just in case. He clarifies the name of the new medication was famotidine. Today (12Jan2021) was the first day it was much better. Caller confirmed he did not take any steroids, the only medication he took was an antihistamine for the management of the symptoms. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported rash in the face that was itchy symmetric and bilateral occurred two days after the first dose of COVID 19 Vaccine, BNT162B2.  Based on the plausible temporal association, the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events and the administration of the suspect.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

I&#39;m wondering if one or more of the vitamins and supplements I took this morning, including Slo-Niacin, fish oil, multivitamins and extra D and C interacted with the vaccine.  I took one Benadryl  tablet at 2:00 p.m. today, which seems to be calming down the redness and itching.

Over the following six days, symptomes frogresses to extreme skin sensitivity and diffuse aching of chest cage and muscles, back, associated with fatigue and stiffness of joints especially after being at rest and trying to move. By the 6th day after onset of symptoms, an erythematous eruption developed along the left T7 dermatome, becoming more pronounced on the 7th day, but not the true vesicular rash we usually see in zoster dermatitis. Discomfort is relieved by taking excedrin and tylenol. I did not try NSAIDs due to gastritis reaction. No fever or chills, sore throat, cough, etc. I started Valtrex today  to be taken tid.

Ibuprofen taken helped diminish pain.  36 hours later still sore but much reduced pain.  Physically active use of arm  I think helped reduction in pain.    Expect after 48 hours to be pain free I hope.

A 68-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 03Mar2021 at about 15:00 (lot number: EN6201 and expiration date: 30Jun2021) at a single dose, received at the hospital for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and patient was immunocompromised. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included immunoglobulin human normal (IMMUNOGLOBULIN [IMMUNOGLOBULIN HUMAN NORMAL]) from 02Mar2021 to 02Mar2021 for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. The patient previously received flu vaccine on 15Oct2020. The patient&#39;s wife called to report on the side effects that the patient was experiencing after he received the Covid-19 Vaccine. The patient had a fever of 101 started at about 23:00 on 03Mar2021 (his regular base temp is about 97). At midnight of 04Mar2021, all of his lymph nodes were swollen under his arm and in his neck; even in his fingers were swollen. Also noticed that his joints were swollen and had a huge bump on his arm at the injection site on 04Mar2021 after midnight last night. The reported added that patient also had a general feeling of unwell and malaise on 03Mar2021. The patient received treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

On 2/28/021 I developed pain, erythema, warmth and swelling at the 4th MCP in my L hand which persisted for several days.  I contacted my rheumatologist, and saw him on 03/04.  Since this was my first episode of inflammation in years, we elected to treat it conservatively with naproxen OTC.  My symptoms resolved after several days, but then I had successive episodes of pain, erythema, warmth and swelling in my R 5th MCP, R ankle, L 5th TMT, L 5th MCP, L knee and R wrist over the next 3 weeks--- in the pattern of palindromic rheumatism similar to that my symptoms had first began 18 years ago.

I had a few bumps on the top of my head which I thought were mosquito bites from working outside at dusk. Two days after I received second vaccine shot, I got a cluster of bumps and a headache. I contacted my primary care physician at medical facility on the following Tuesday. The Doctor said it looks like Shingles and started me on medication.

                                                Approx 8 days after 1st shot I was on lake late afternoon.  Temp started dropping at dark and both hands started getting extremely cold.  Temp was only about 58 degrees.  Back of hands started itching extremely bad, then seemed to be buring, and shortly after started freezing!  Couple of days later:  skin broke out in a rash with pea size blood blisters.   My first though was I had used some clorox and thought that might be the problem until I saw online about other blood blister reactions.  For 3 or 4 weeks when the temp got low (even down to 65) when I was outside my hands would get extremely cold.  I thought maybe because of a lack of blood circulation.  Skin on both hand over knuckles continued to peel and blister continued for approx 18 days.   As of today:  all blister are gone and skin has completely healed.   Although temps aren&#39;t as low now as back in Feb. I was out in 50 degree weather the other night and my hand don&#39;t seem to get freezing cold like before.  I think they are back to normal as well.  I did have my second shot on March 19.

He clarifies that he woke up shaking like a leaf and took some Tylenol and was very tired, he went to work for a half day. No further details provided about the Tylenol he took. He says he was very tired, and then the headache started Saturday morning, he couldn&#39;t move his neck and his head felt like it was going to explode. He says he had fever and chills, and was going through 4 sets of clothes at night, he was even sleeping on towels because he was sweating so much. He says his fever fluctuated from 101.2 to 102.4 over four days. He says he just ate soup and drank water. He says he had the fever and was sweating and kept changing clothes.

He says that on day 20 the rash just went away, and his hands now have the skin peeling away, he doesn&#39;t know if anyone else went thru this. He says he has been putting lotion on his hands, but his skin is peeling away like crazy, he would like to know if anyone else has been going through this. He says now there is supposed to be a booster shot every 6 months after getting the two doses, they would have to convince him to get booster, he is a really healthy guy,and this put him in bed for a week. He says if this is what the treatment feels like to prevent getting the disease, he would hate to actually have it. He says when he talked to his doctor they had told him if his symptoms lasted one more day to go to the hospital. Caller clarifies that until day 20 he had the rash to his arms and hands, then day 20 it finally subsided and his arms and hands welts and rash disappeared, and now his skin is peeling away everywhere.

He noticed that he has lost his body hair, his legs are smooth, his arms are smooth and he was hairy before the vaccine.  He has no body facial hair and was extremely embarrassingly hairy prior to this, very thick and curly and now  has nothing  on the legs and arms.  The hair on his chest is darker but not as full as it was.  This has been rather sudden of a change.

A 68-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 16Apr2021 (at the age of 68-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; also received co-suspect drug: upadacitinib (RINVOQ) via oral on unspecified date at unknown dose, daily for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. On unspecified date, the patient experienced immunodeficiency (immune system low), tiredness, and joint pain (described as: patient was feeling tired and felt his immune system was low on unspecified date, since he had been doing a lot of travelling and that his joints hurt a little bit in winter). On unspecified date in Apr2021, he broke out with shingles in his scalp and it went down the left side of his head to his neck. Outcome of the events joint pain was recovered on unspecified date; while event shingles recovered on unspecified date in Apr2021. Outcome of the event tiredness was not recovered; while outcome of the event immunodeficiency (immune system low) was unknown. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events (tiredness, joint pain and shingles in scalp and it went down left side of head to neck) with upadacitinib (RINVOQ) was no reasonable possibility; while for the reporter&#39;s causality for the event (immune system low) was not provided.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events (immune system low, tiredness, joint pain and shingles) with the suspect product (BNT162B2) was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  Information on batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The association between the reported events immune system low, tiredness, joint pain, and shingles with BNT162B2 can not be completely excluded. The history of rheumatoid arthritis might be contributory as well.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 02May2021 at 02:00 PM (14:00) (at the age of 68 years), as first dose, single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included glaucoma from 2010. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included dorzolamide, brimonidine, and travoprost (TRAVATAN); all for glaucoma. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient and his wife got the vaccine on 02May2021 and just wanted to report possible side effects. The patient did go online and reported this just in case he couldn&#39;t get through to the company. On 03May2021 at 08:00, the patient experienced sore throat after vaccination. About a week after that (May2021), the sore throat cleared up. Then after that (May2021), the patient started feeling some pain in his left leg, it&#39;s like a numbing pain in the left leg. The pain was still there, it&#39;s maybe about 4 on the scale of 1 to 10 (May2021), but it&#39;s kind of a numbing pain. The patient got a little pain in his lower back on the left side also in May2021; patient didn&#39;t know if it&#39;s muscle cramps over working. The patient just needed to report this. The patient and his wife are due to take another shot tomorrow (23May2021), so he didn&#39;t want things to be complicated before he reported this. Currently, for the pain in the left leg and the back, the patient talked to his nurse yesterday (21May2021) and the nurse said he might have cellulitis (May2021). It sounded like symptoms of cellulitis. And so, the nurse suggested antibiotics and the patient was thinking that he didn&#39;t know if he wanted to risk trying to get an antibiotic before he gets his next COVID-19 shot, things might get out of way and complicated. They didn&#39;t give the patient a name for antibiotics; they suggested the patient to go somewhere because he was thinking of postponing that after the next dose of the vaccine. Currently, treatment was not given for the events. The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures on an unspecified date including blood test and physical check-up. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient considered the events as non-serious. The patient recovered from &#34;Sore throat&#34; in May2021. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Numbing pain in the left leg&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot or batch number for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                4 days after the injection I had some raised red bumps on my right are in the ante-cub ital area.  These went away in 2 days and did not itch.  Over the following couple of weeks I started to have intermittent red bumps with flakey surfaces and intense itching on both arms .  At this time I have several of these over both arms and my back with intense itching that I&#39;m using hydrocortisone cream to treat.  I am scheduled for the second shot on Tuesday Feb 16.  Today, Feb 14, these spots are increasing in number and itching. I am going to contact my PCP to day to try to be seen tomorrow before the scheduled second dose.

                                                My reactions were :  Mild Injection Site Pain, Tiredness, Headache, Severe Muscle Pain, Some Chills, Feverish, feeling Unwell, Sinus issues and Coughing.  Very Erratic and disrupted sleep for Days. The Major Adverse effect is that these Reactions are within the Range of Published and known Effects. I treated them at home with Rest and Some Tylenol, but was not really capable of normal functioning or to be Employed.. But they were Persistent for 6 1/2 Days....   I have spoken to No One who have had the symptoms last this long. It seemed and felt like descriptions  of Real Covid or past Influenzas but the symptoms seemed more severe and longer. I have spoken with many who have had real Covid who&#39;s symptoms and length of illness were milder... I did contact my Physician to advise of this event.

                                                Several episodes of mild transient and migratory urticaric skin hives; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN9581) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 03Feb2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, no concomitant medications and was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient previously took ibuprofen from an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported he had several episodes of mild transient and migratory urticaric skin hives starting on 04Feb2021 at 07:00, which he was not certain were related to the vaccine. He reported the first episode occurred 17 hours after vaccination, located over right knee and lower leg and lasted 2 hours. The second episode occurred 36 hours after vaccination located on left forearm and lasted one hour. The third episode occurred 48 hours after vaccination located over right knee and lasted 2 hours. The patient experienced no other symptoms and reported that all resolved spontaneously. The event was reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. No treatment was provided for the event. The clinical outcome of several episodes of mild transient and migratory urticaric skin hives was recovered in Feb2021. It was also reported that since vaccination the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Admission to ER for suspected cardiac event.  Intense pain continues for 4.5 hours despite multiple administrations of fentanyl. ER tests negative for heart attack. CT interpretation does not rule out suspected aortic dissection due to fluid around aneurysm (later ruled out with second CT). Transfer to another Hospital for possible cardiac repair. Surgeon disagrees with CT reading. Three days in ICU and Step Down, CT, Cardiac Echo, Carotid Echo, Chest X Ray, Blood Tests all negative for cardiac event.

He also inquired if increased blood pressure was side effect and how long did it last.

Patient stated his head seemed full and now after a week he still had a headache. He added it felt like his head was going to explode. It was still there but better now but it came and went. His blood pressure was up too. Usually, it was only 130 at the top but now it was 130 to 150 on the top. Added he felt like he was racing all the time and could not relax. He was unsure how long after the vaccine he noticed these effects but stated it had been going on for several days. He was scheduled to get the second dose 18Feb2021. Patient went to get his allergy shot today (as reported) and when the nurse went to do the shot, his arm was still bruised and where they put the bandaid over there was an impression of the bandaid was all reddish.

History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none.The outcome of the event headache was recovering, outcome of the event head felt like it was going to explode was unknown, and outcome of the other events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                thought he was having a heart attack; It was all over his body and his left side, the pain/ left side hurts/ spread up his arm and down his hand and shoulders; left side hurts because that was where he got the shot; the first shot almost killed him, he has a defibrillator attached to his heart; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). A 69-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: ER8732) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm, on 23Mar2021 (at the age of 69 years old), as 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included stroke, weak heart, defibrillator/pacemaker insertion, impaired eyesight/ half-blind, pneumonia, headache, and ongoing prostate. The patient had a defibrillator attached to his heart, staples in his chest, and stitches. He got a weak heart from pneumonia which gave him a stroke and led to impaired sight. Patient stated everything else was working. The reason he&#39;s blind was because pneumonia hit his heart and caused a stroke along with the medication he was being given, and it happened before getting the COVID vaccine and has nothing to do with the shot. The stroke caused blindness, and they needed to add a defibrillator to his heart because the pneumonia weakened his heart even more than it was already weak. He had a defibrillator attached to his heart 14 years ago and it got took out about 7 years ago because his heart was better. He reported he had to get another defibrillator due a problem from pneumonia. The patient missed his first appointment for the first dose as he had back trouble and a headache. He called the hospital, and they listed off if you&#39;re feeling this or this don&#39;t come. The patient wasn&#39;t feeling well, so he didn&#39;t go; he did not seek medical treatment. The patient has compromising conditions; he has a defibrillator and he take blood pressure and heart medications. Every time they tested him, he was negative for COVID and he did not test positive. Concomitant medications included tamsulosin taken for prostate, start and stop date were not reported. The patient was also taking nearly 15 pills a day; 6 in morning, 2 in the afternoon/lunch, 6 at evening time and some at night before bed. He reported that he was pill popping because of his condition and he could sell and still have more than enough for himself to take, that is how bad it is for him. The patient reported about number one and number two shots of COVID vaccine. The number one shot scared him, so he was scared of getting shot number two. He didn&#39;t know what the deal of it. He received it at the hospital on 23Mar2021 (Tuesday), and it woke him up on Wednesday morning around 2 A.M (24Mar2021) and he thought he was having a heart attack. The patient wanted the second shot, but he didn&#39;t want to get it. He wanted to know whether you have to take the first shot over again or can you take the second; he heard the second shot was worse. He missed his appointment on 15Apr2021 because the first shot scared him, and he panicked. The patient stated that the first shot almost killed him, he has a defibrillator attached to his heart, and he was scared to get the second. The patient wanted to know what the deal was, if he can take second dose safely. He stated no big deal, and he&#39;s leery after the first shot woke him up. He had a pain from Wednesday morning to Sunday afternoon, stated he had a pain grade of 6-12. The patient also stated that he has been going crazy with other things, staying away from other things, with the condition he&#39;s in, he&#39;s blind, and he stayed in the house. When he went out, he was covered. The pain lasted Wednesday through Sunday, he didn&#39;t go anywhere and makes precaution to make sure not to catch something, he&#39;s always masked and always home. The patient reported that he was having pain at times when he touches his side. When he goes to bed, he sleeps on his right side with his arm across his body laying on a foam block because that side hurts. He clarified that his left side hurts because that was where he got the shot. He was surprised, the pain was so sharp, he thought he was having a heart attack. It came from his elbow, started there and spread up his arm and down his hand and shoulders. His left side hurt when he touched and pressed down, it was a pain of 12. He thought he was having a heart attack, and it scared him, that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t get the second shot. He heard the second one was worse than the first one. If the first one made him feel he was having a heart attack, the second one would surely kill him. He was worried so he decided to stay home. He felt like a kid staying home from school. The pain went away, it just scared him for how he woke up. If he had a pain grade face in the hospital, it was off the chart. He knew how he felt and how he looked, it would be off the chart. He thought in his mind he was dying, felt like he was having a heart attack, like he was dying. It took a little bit of time, he had to calm down and find where the pain was coming from, and where it was going. Pain was coming from his elbow, across his chest and hitting his defibrillator. Patient stated this was the reason he felt he was having a heart attack. The defibrillator woke him up, it had an effect on it, it woke him up and scared him. They had to put the defibrillator in because he needed it for his heart. He thought he was having a heart attack after all this, he was bugging. His son came in, and he told his son that he was in pain. His son told him not to get the shot and believed this was why the patient was hurting. His son said the vaccine and the defibrillator caused him to feel like he&#39;s having  a heart attack, the shot did something to his elbow which caused the pain and when it hit, it hit everything  and he had a pain grade of 20. It woke him up and scared him. He won&#39;t say what he wanted to say, it is personal, but it scared him that much he wanted to go there.  The patient was supposed to get his second dose 15Apr2021 because the first shot scared him, and he panicked, he did not because he was scared to death. The patient reported that everything began on Wednesday, the pain was gone, and he has recovered completely. Patient stated his pain grade was a 6-12. The pain in his elbow has recovered completely. He stated his elbow showed pain when it gets cold or rains, when it gets wet. Patient wanted to make sure if he gets the second shot, does he have to get the first shot again since he missed the second shot appointment. Everybody was saying to get the COVID vaccine, to prevent him from getting COVID, they wanted everyone to get vaccinated. He was unable to read his vaccine card because he was half-blind and will have someone else look at it. The patient missed his second dose appointment due to the effect of the first dose of the vaccine; he had a bad reaction from the number 1 shot and that was why he did not get the number 2 shot because of him being compromised due to his condition and the medications he takes. He had the first dose on 23Mar2021 and scheduled to get the second dose on 25Apr2021 (more than 21 days).  He believed the ingredients combined this caused it, when he had the event he thought that it did bother his defibrillator, he had pain that made him think he was having a heart attack. That with the meds it may have added to the pressure he received when he got the shot, where he got the shot. His left side was bothering him, he thought he had a heart attack; his defibrillator was thumping, and he had pain that hit his elbow and his defibrillator woke him up. He knew it had to do with COVID shot. It was all over his body and his left side, the pain. His heart medication and blood pressure medication were nothing different. He had pain in his side, that he does not normally have which branched out from the elbow, to the hand, to the defibrillator. His left side was sore and he could not lay on it and could not touch it since it was so painful. Patient confirmed the pain was all down the left side and he got the vaccine in his left arm. The only last effect he was having is that he was afraid to get that second shot, he was afraid to go to sleep as he won&#39;t wake up after getting the 2nd shot or how he will going to react to it. He was paranoid in his mind to get the second shot. He reported that everything was wrong with him and that the shot had to fight with his medications and his body pain for it. He reported his body is paying the price. He felt like he was having a heart attack, pain going up and down arm, his fingers felt like needles going into his hand, like life was going back through his hand. His pain went to his chest his face was nowhere on the pain chart, his pain was like a 16 on a scale of 1 to 10. When he woke up that night it was like a 20, then if he touched his arm the pain was like a 14-16. The patient could not sleep, he could not sleep on his left side. Patient had to put a foam pad on his left side he got from his friend or sleep on his right side. That started Wednesday morning at 2 A.M to Sunday morning, he was surprised when he woke up that Sunday, he was not in pain when he woke up on his back. Patient reported he was half blind and can&#39;t find his medications. He reported he put his medications down earlier and was not sure where they were.nAround that time he went to the hospital due to breathing issues, problems breathing. He went in twice and they discharged him on their own but, he had more problems breathing. What he did not know at the time he had because he did not look at the discharge paper and no one explained them to him was that he had Pneumonia when he went to the hospital. The outcome of the events vaccination site pain, heart attack was recovered on unspecified date in 2021; while for the remaining events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

This 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EM9809), via an unknown route, on 08Feb2021 (at the age of 69-year-old male) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included indigestion/heart burn. Relevant concomitant medications included pantoprazole taken from an unknown date for indigestion/heart burn, and statin. About 3 to 4 days after he received the first dose he started getting an itchy rash on his arms and his chest and things, his back and his calves in his leg, and it have not gotten away and when he went to get his second dose yesterday and he told them about this symptom, they would not give him the second dose. And he is going to see a dermatologist on 15Mar2021 and he is hoping that she is going be able to tell him, if it&#39;s safe to get the second dose or what, he doesn&#39;t know where to go from here, they would not give him the dose because of the rash and he is not sure if the dermatologist is going to give him okay to get the second dose or what, he doesn&#39;t know if this is coincidence that he got the rash or what. Therapeutic measures taken as result of the events included cortisone cream. In early Feb2021, the patient had his annual physical examination including blood work-up, cholesterol, and PSA but results were not provided. The patient wish he could talk to someone that would tell him that this might be caused by the vaccine or no this is not caused by the vaccine. He realized that not seeing him in personal and stuff is difficult to make that assessment. But he just realized he is just a &#39;bimbo&#39; here and he might know if he never going get the second vaccine because of the rash, so he is kind of frustrated about it. The patient had not recovered from the events.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

It felt stiff and sore all day and when I returned from work, at about 7:30PM, when I removed my shirt, I saw that it was red, somewhat swollen &amp; felt hard around the area where I was injected.  At 10PM it&#39;s still that way.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

Large welts developed in those areas.  I contacted a covid nurse and she called me and advised over the counter Benadryl for symptoms and to contact my doctor. I messaged him and sent photos of the infected areas. He prescribed Prednisone 10 mg to take in a five day burst.  It has been two weeks now and this rash is just now getting better. I wonder if a second dose is advisable.

                                                None of my health care providers have been able to explain the cause of my sudden loss of vision in my left eye at approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb 2021.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist&#39;s answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.  Prior to approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb, my vision was as it had been for several years prior with little if any degradation.  I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference &#34;physical&#34; with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.  Upon leaving the ER at approx. 10:30 a.m. on 8 Feb my &#34;end of visit vitals&#34; were recorded as blood pressure 110/63, BMI 20.92, weight 150 lbs., height 5&#39;11&#34;, temperature 97.6 F, pulse 67, respiration 16, and oxygen saturation 95%.  Late last year I had my usual flu vaccination without any side effects.  After almost 2 weeks, I do still have a bruise at the Pfizer vaccine injection site on my left arm and I experienced mild muscle soreness the evening after my vaccination and the following morning.  Normally I have no adverse reaction to vaccinations.

Also some neck and shoulder pain. That was around 5:30pm. Took 2 / 200mg ibuprofen (over the counter medication) and did help to relive discomfort. On 02/14/2021 woke up around 8am and most of my joints had mild aches to include neck and shoulder stiffness and pain. Pain both days on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate a 2 or 3.

                                                Slight swelling of toes (first on right foot and ca. one week later of a couple on left foot) accompanied by blotchy appearance and tenderness and inflammation. Blistering sort of phenomenon (although no open sores). Looks the same as what I see on internet as &#34;COVID-toes&#34;, although I&#39;ve not seen any sign of it as a reaction to the vaccine itself.

Feb 11:  Was very tired in the afternoon and took a 2 hour nap; I do not usually take any naps. Feb. 12, afternoon:  Temperature 100ºF, mild sniffles similar to cold or pollen allergy, sinus headache; felt tired but not enough to nap. I took 2 aspirin.  The fever subsided within an hour.  I took 2 more aspirin every 6 hours on Feb. 12 and Feb. 13.   Feb. 13:  I still felt a little tired but not enough to take a nap. Outcome:  The aspirin resolved the fever and it did not recur.  The headache was very mild and I did not treat it after I stopped taking the aspirin on Feb. 13.  The sniffles and mild cold symptoms went away after a few days and did not require any treatment.

                                                Received 1st of 2 Pfizer vaccines on 1/29/21 around noon. Within 6 hours of injection, developed severe  itching of the left chest area. No redness or inflammation at the injection site in arm ever. By the next morning, he had developed a widespread raised, red, pruritic rash on his chest, abdomen,thighs and buttocks. He didn&#39;t tell me, (his wife) until 2/11 and never reported it as not sure who to report it to. I insisted he call his PCP but we had the severe winter storm, power outages and many businesses were closed or not available. He is due for the second vaccine on 2/21/21 however the rash persists. He has been taking Allegra daily to decrease the itching.

Starting on Friday, six days after receiving the shot, the itching  was a little more aggressive. I started to use  over the counter Hydrocortisone .5% level, which helped.  The inching is not severe just agitating .

I had a mild fever (99.4) which was about 2 degrees above normal. The selling has subsided in the second 24 hours and my temperature returned to normal. There is still moderate swelling and sensitivity. I had not seen this reported as a common side effect of the vaccination. I thought it should be reported.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber. The patient&#39;s second dose was on 19Feb2021. The outcome of the events stomach cramps, felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t was recovered on 30Jan2021, not a lot of energy/little lack of energy, not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine/whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine was recovering, while unknown for the rest of the events.

                                                I woke up with slightly itchy, severe skin rash on 2/23/2021 following second vaccine injection at 10:58 am on 2/21/2021. The rash completely covered both buttocks, the  top front inside of both thighs, both hips, the front groin area, inside/bottom of both feet. Given the extent and intensity of rash, it must have started on Monday 2/22/2021. The rash was red-purple with white spots (perhaps hives).   I contacted my primary care physician&#39;s office on 2/23/2021 and had a televisit with the nurse. Her diagnosis was Allergic Dermatitis/Itching. She prescribed Banophen (50 mg), Triamcinolone cream, and Cetirizine HCL (10 mg). I took the medicine.  Continued below.

This was accompanied by either bizarre dreams or hallucinations during the night. When I awoke in the morning I was very unrested and very unstable. My morning coffee did not taste appealing. By 30 hours after the vaccination I had returned to feeling better, albeit with a mildly sore injection site, and was able to return to normal activity. No treatment was sought.  No further issues presented themselves.

                                                A couple of days after 2nd vaccine in series, began to develop rash on left side/rib area extending around waist to spine.  Rash was initially maculopapular with erythematous base.  As rash continued to spread around waist, areas became vesicular grouped lesions.   Experienced severe pain, stinging, burning at lesion sites and around flank area to back.  Continuing neuropathic-type pain.   Treated symptoms with calamine lotion,   topical patch, and ibuprofen for discomfort.   Lesions have now crusted for the most part,  rash in various stages of healing with a few vesicular areas remaining.  Continues to have neuropathic pain to area.

                                                My left arm muscle located on underarm between elbow and injection site, halfway between elbow and injection site higher up became extremely sore to the touch and prevented me from lifting my arm to preform functions.  Today is much better and function has mostly returned. The reason I am reporting is because I just (jan.29 2021) tore my rotator cuff on right  shoiulder and the loss of function is similar. Function is returning on left arm so no worried, the right shoulder will need shoulder replacement surgery.  But that was the effect on this adverse event. Loss of function to left arm about 3 days with improvement after 36 hours. Kind of a delayed response, so not sure its related. But I didn&#39;t injure the left so probably related.

After searching the internet, I found informaton regarding gout - The symptoms exactly matched my symptoms.  Additionally, afterwards, I discovered an article in Podiatry Today that reported gout attacks after vaccinations.

                                                Patient is a male who presents for a 1 month history of numbness, tingling and weakness of the fourth and fifth fingers of the left hand. He presents with his wife who concurs with history. He describes the numbness tingling sensation extending up his left hand into the proximal forearm and what would be the ulnar distribution.  He is noted weakness of the fourth and fifth digits such that he cannot fully grasp with that hand compared to his contralateral hand.  Patient describes more numbness and weakness than frank pain although he has noticed it when he is woken up at night.  He has not taken any specific medication for this.  Patient states this started approximately April eighth ninth or 10th several days after getting his first Pfizer vaccination in the left arm.  That was a Pfizer Lot number EN 8737 expiration July 2021 given on April 6 at the urgent care vaccination site.  Patient feels the vaccine was given behind his deltoid on the shoulder rather than mid deltoid muscle.  He did not have any pain numbness or shooting sensations immediately.  Reports the muscle was a little sore that day or the next but really nothing of significance until several days later. He did not report any significant redness or swelling at the site of the vaccination.  He reports not having any photos of the side of the vaccination but he and his wife did take a photo about a week ago of the area of that he feels is still tender in the posterior shoulder region It is not clear to me whether the soreness in the shoulder extended down to the hand and then improve leaving the hand symptoms or whether soreness disappeared at the time the hand arm symptoms came on. He has not had any similar symptoms he denies having any carpal tunnel or hand problems in the past. Past medical history is pertinent for: some chronic back pain in the thoracic or lumbar region that began after traumatic vertebral fractures following a motor vehicle accident in 2012. he is followed by Dr. of pain specialist of, She is maintained on chronic methadone.  He has had recent lower thoracic or lumbar block with plans to have radioablation therapy to those nerve roots in the next several days. Also has well-controlled hypertension on lisinopril 20 mg and takes 81 mg enteric-coated aspirin daily. Here for evaluation as symptoms have not resolved on their own over the last 3 to 4 weeks

                                                Three to four days after the injection I began to feel muscle and joint aches in my entire body along with fatigue. These symptoms grew in intensity and lasted about seven days, then suddenly diminished and then stopped.  Dates: (1) January 8, 2021: injection; (2)  January 11 - 13: beginning of symptoms; (3) January 16-17: lessening of symptoms; (4) January 18: disappearance of symptoms.   I also experienced soreness in my left arm at the site of the injection.  That began several hours after the injection and was much more intense than the soreness I usually experience with flu shots.  The soreness lasted about 24 hours, again much longer than my experience with flu shorts.  It then suddenly diminished and then stopped--same pattern as the aches and fatigue described above.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes (controlled by food not by injection), coronary artery spasm (blood vessels that occasionally collapsed), glaucoma, and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included albuterol for asthma, atorvastatin (LIPITOR), glyceryl trinitrate (NITROGLYCERIN) for coronary artery spasm, and numbers of eye drops (unspecified) for glaucoma. The patient had taken the COVID-19 vaccine just not too long ago and had good number of non-serious side effects. The patient was not really concerned with these side effects that she had. On 13Jan2021, the patient had the little bit of pain from the injection site but that&#39;s common with any injection, so he did not count it, but next day the events started, and he still had some, but they were subsiding. The next events happened the next day after administration (14Jan2021). The patient had the injection site pain and the arm is still weak, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, and feeling unwell on 14Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the events.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3249, Expiry Date: May2021), intramuscularly on 15Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single, left arm for covid-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications reported as none. There was some/fair amount of bleeding that soaked/saturated the bandage after the shot and a bruise developed that was 3 inches around and was there for 10 days and he still had the bruise. He said that there was also a cold sensation at the injection site when it was administered and he felt a chill on his arm. He said that he was calling because he wanted to make sure the first dose was effective. He said that his 2nd dose was due next week. The bleeding resolved within the hour and soaked the band aid itself. He said that it was not persistent bleeding it was just immediately after the injection. He also had some significant soreness at the injection site and stated that the injection site was still sore if he presses on it.  He never bothered to look at his arm and stated that he noticed the bruise was there about 8 days later. It might have been there prior to that, but he did not know.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm from 15Jan2021 at 13:00 at 71-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; administered at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none.  Concomitant medications included finasteride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), pravastatin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), tamsulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), vitamins nos (MULTIVITAMIN [VITAMINS NOS]); all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; received within two weeks of the vaccine. On 15Jan2021 at 13:00, the patient experienced: bleeding through bandage (ceased quickly) (medically significant), pain at needle insertion (non-serious), cold/chill sensation at injection site (non-serious), very large bruise at injection site (non-serious), residual discomfort at injection site (non-serious); with no treatment received . The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s concern was whether these issues affect the efficacy of the injection. The patient wanted to know if the vaccine was administered incorrectly. The patient wanted to know if he should be concerned about the continuing discomfort. The patient reported that he received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm from 05Feb2021 at 13:00 at 71-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and there was no reaction whatsoever to the second injection (other than slight arm discomfort; none of the above-described issues). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab (SARS-CoV-2 test): negative   on 19Jan2021, negative on 26Jan2021, negative on 02Feb2021, unknown results-pending on 09Feb2021. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (&#34;recovered with lasting effects&#34;) on an unspecified date.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EM9809, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 12:30 (at 71-year-old) at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (mild hypertension and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-6 years ago), hyperlipidemia (mild hyperlipidemia and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-10 years ago). He stated in Aug, he tested positive for antibodies through Lab and was still positive a month later. He wondered how that might effect the decision of if he should get the second dose, if he is potentially immune. He had no symptoms but tested negative with PCR test. His girlfriend who he lives with tested negative for antibodies. Height was reported as 6 feet to 6 feet one inch tall. Weight was reported as 176-178lbs, he thought he may have gained a few pounds. There were no concomitant medications. The caller had the first dose of the vaccine 10Feb2021 12:30. 5 days later he felt fullness in his right ear (Feb2021) and noticed diminished hearing in the right ear (Feb2021), maybe 20-30% less. He was comparing how much he could hear the ticking of his watch in his left and right ear and couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all. He went to an ENT and they found that it was reduced in the right ear secondary to a nerve problem and wasn&#39;t secondary to anything else. The doctor read online on an ENT site, a couple of people had acute bouts of decreased hearing. They were treated with steroids and resolved. His provider prescribed him with a high dose of steroids, 70 mg. He was going to take it after dinner but all of the sudden he could hear the ticking better. He held off on taking the steroid and the next morning his hearing was fine. He went back and they retested and it was back to normal. He had taken Naprosyn and is not sure if that played a part in improving things. It resolved not even 24 hours after the initial symptoms. It resolved on its own. He asked, is this a side effect that has been reported? Are there any cases of this happening in one ear rather than 2? Could it be a contraindication getting the second dose? His doctor is researching it and he is supposed to call early next week about this. He asked how many people were in the clinical trials that the side effect data is based on. The caller stated he heard someone report that he doesn&#39;t believe that people getting the vaccine necessarily need both doses of the vaccine. They are finding after a week after the first dose they have relative immunity and might not need the second dose. The caller asked how effective this vaccine might be on new variants, how effective just one dose of the vaccine is, if Pfizer is looking into mixing the vaccines- whether it will be something that can be interchanged with other Covid-19 vaccines, asked where he could find updates on medical information about  this in the future. The caller stated he wanted to thank Pfizer for developing the vaccine as quickly as they did. Retired psychiatrist calling about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who says he got his first dose on 10Feb in (State name), and had a sore left arm where he got the injection (Feb2021) then 5 days later had fullness in his right ear with his hearing diminished. He says he called his otolaryngologist because he had had a hearing test a few months ago, and was tested again now and there was a moderate decrease of hearing in his right ear. He says he would like to know if this could be a possible side effect, since he has read of reports and his otolaryngologist knew of two reports where people did report hearing loss. He says that he was treated acutely with steroids at high dose of 70mg for which he filled the script, then called his internist who was ambivalent with him taking a high dose. Caller says then within a few hours, his hearing was better, and by the next morning it was normal, and he went back to the ENT and his hearing was the same as it was a few months ago. He says he did not take the steroid he was prescribed, the Prednisone, he took Naproxen, and since it may have been a nerve problem with hearing diminished related to auditory nerve, it seemed to get better in a number of hours. He says he has reported this already to VAERS. Caller says his right ear is better now, it got better within a a few hours after he saw his doctor, then it was completely better by the next morning. He says that after they tested his hearing due to the fullness in his ear and hearing being diminished it got  better on its own. He says on the next hearing test his hearing was exactly back to normal. He says he did take Naproxen once or twice during that time period, 20 or less hour period, more like 12 hours, one 220mg tablet each time, he doesn&#39;t know whether that contributed to helping. Naproxen (EXP Jan2022, LOT: ODRO445). He says that the reason he is calling is to see whether Pfizer has had similar reports. He says that he saw on a website that 12 people were reporting deafness or blindness, but it seemed to be an (name), so he took it with a grain of salt. He says he would like to know whether people have been reporting with issues for hearing, unilaterally or bilaterally, or what results have been with some people. Caller says unfortunately the website he mentioned was obviously anti vaccine and claimed to be with the (name) or version of the CDC and said that they were reporting they had 12 people reporting deafness and blindness from COVID vaccine and made it sound like the most dangerous vaccine in the world, but it was a conspiracy website that claimed it was with the equivalent of CDC. Caller does not have website addresses to provide or details about reports on that site.  Caller says he looked at the (name) and it said nothing about this kind of possible side effect. He says he doesn&#39;t know if his could be related to getting the vaccine, or if he should still get a second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all&#34; and &#34;he felt fullness in his right ear&#34; was recovered in Feb2021, while for other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported unilateral  deafness was unlikely related to bnt162b2.  This was  an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 15Jan2021 at 13:00 (at the age of 71-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications, taken within 2 weeks of vaccination, included tamsulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), finasteride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), pravastatin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient experienced bleeding at injection site, large bruise, sensation of chill/cold at vaccination site at time of injection, and soreness on 15Jan2021 13:00. The events were reported as non-serious. The clinical course was reported as: The bleeding at injection site saturated the Band-Aid, but subsided quickly; the large bruise, which was now diminished, but still exists some 17 days later (as reported); sensation of chill/cold at vaccination site at time of injection; and soreness, although not significant, it still persists to this date of reporting. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab: negative on 26Jan2021. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of bleeding at injection site was recovered on an unspecified date, sensation of chill/cold at vaccination site at time of injection was recovered on 15Jan2021, and large bruise and soreness was recovering.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

                                                shingles; he started feeling strange; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 71 years, on 20Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included white blood cell count decreased from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient stated that his white blood cell count was usually on the low side and his doctor sends him to a hematologist to do whatever, then they say he was fine. Concomitant medication included an unspecified flu shot. The patient said that he had his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot 20Jan2021, and this coming Wednesday he was supposed to have his second shot, but unfortunately in the interim he found out he has shingles. He says he would like to know if he can get a second shot or would he need to hold off. He says that developed shingles 9 days later after getting first COVID-19 vaccine shot (31Jan2021), and he doesn&#39;t want to do something that will be a problem. He says that he was on an antiviral to treat the shingles. No further details provided about the antiviral. He says he didn&#39;t go see his doctor until last Wednesday, he thinks he has been suffering from shingles since 07Feb2021 or a little before that when he started feeling strange. The patient clarified he meant 31Jan2021 since he began dealing with this. The patient said when he was diagnosed with shingles they didn&#39;t do any tests, the doctor walked into the room and looked at him, though he didn&#39;t have a lot then, over the days it has gotten worse. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of shingles (herpes zoster). The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 71-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 23Feb2021 at 12:45 PM (at the age of 71-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, cholesterol, abdominal discomfort. Concomitant medications included lisinopril taken for hypertension, simvastatin for blood cholesterol, omeprazole for abdominal discomfort, and multivitamin. Historic vaccination included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 71-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 24Feb2021, about 12 hours later almost to the hour, the patient had symptoms. The patient had fever, real bad headache, chills/couldn&#39;t get warm, weak, his arm really hurt where he got the shot, couldn&#39;t fall asleep. The patient clinical course was reported as follows: About 12 hours later almost to the hour, he had symptoms including: fever, real bad headache, chills, and the fever ran somewhere 100 or a little over he guesses. This lasted most of that morning on Wednesday on the 24Feb2021. He took his temperature with an oral digital thermometer. He reports his temperature usually ranges 97.7-97.6 somewhere around there. And he couldn&#39;t get warm. He had a mattress heater turned up and he felt weak and since he&#39;s by himself he has to get up to get water and he put his heavy robe on then he got back in bed. He never went to sleep, he couldn&#39;t fall asleep, his arm really hurt where he got the shot. There was a little ache with the first one but this one here really, really was bothering him. When he first got the second shot, he hates needles, it was a little sore and then when this started it really started to hurt and it was warm. That went on to the morning, then it started letting up a bit. His daughter came by and made him chicken soup and he felt a little better, still weakfish. His fever went down kind of far and he laid down the rest of the day. Towards dinner time or so he felt warm but didn&#39;t have fever, he went the opposite from being chilled to being warm but his temperature was around 98. Then later on he was taking some pain medicine, called his doctor and asked what he should take for the headache. Take whatever he has there is what he was told. Acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It says Headache relief, caller states he is just about blind, acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It got rid of whatever he had. Patient stated he needs to change the thingy on his CCTV. Clarified he uses a CCTV magnifying system, it&#39;s a camera system with the 24 inch monitor. He felt better then he fell asleep around 10 that night and he woke up around 4:00AM on the 25Feb2021. He reports whatever fever he had, he was soaked but he felt really ok then from then on. He finally got up around 7-730 AM and he&#39;s feeling ok now. If he had a fever it broke. He reported it seems to be improved on the 25Feb2021. He was feeling pretty good he started making coffee so he didn&#39;t feel bad and he hasn&#39;t had anything since. He reports his arm is not bothering him unless he pokes it. It&#39;s the same thing with the flu shot, if he pushes on it in a certain place he knows he got the shot. The injection site is not warm, all that went away on 25Feb2021. The clinical outcome of fever, real bad headache, chills/ couldn&#39;t get warm, weak, couldn&#39;t fall asleep, was recovered on 25Feb2021. The clinical outcome of his arm really hurt where he got the shot was unknown.

                                                7 days after  my 1st vaccine a severe rash developed on face and neck; both arms covered w/ red sores. I went to dermatologist and given cortisone ointments that helped; symptoms gradually cleared. I didn&#39;t associate symptoms with vaccine. since they appeared 8 days later. I assumed it was a psoraisis flare up, as did my dermatologist.  I had the 2nd vaccine 3 weeks later with no adverse effects until 8 days later when the same symptoms occurred but were more severe. My family doctor (not dermatologist) diagnosed an allergic reaction to the covid vaccinations and prescribed prednisone steroid and cortisone creams. My condition gradually improved over the next 9 days, but I still have small red lesions on both arms.

                                                His arm was a little more sore after the 2nd shot; It felt more like a nerve pain with a lot of tingling, burning feeling rather than an achy joint pain; Started to get more and more severe; He couldn&#39;t sleep at night; Stiffness/ it is hard to bend his fingers; It&#39;s more like numbness and burning, a sharp pain in that location between those fingers; It&#39;s more like numbness and burning, a sharp pain in that location between those fingers; It felt more like a nerve pain with a lot of tingling, burning feeling rather than an achy joint pain; Started having a pretty sharp pain on  left hand, in between thumb, middle finger, and index finger, pretty severe in his index finger/also felt it in  right hand; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 71-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 at 00:30 in left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 later in afternoon, around 2:30M in left shoulder at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included arthritis and injury. He has some arthritis in his knee and also in left elbow. Arthritis diagnosed after he had an injury a year or so ago, diagnosed in left elbow around Nov2020. Concomitant medications included Acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), Lot number: P122153, Expiration date: Oct2022 at a dose of 81 mg tablet by mouth as needed for arthritis and injury. Patient had arthritis in knee due to injury, had injury while whitewater rafting years ago, has been taking it since then. It is a low dose 81mg, he will take a bigger dose, but only takes one.   The patient reported that his arm was a little more sore after the 2nd shot than in the 1st. On 10Feb2021, he started having a pretty sharp pain on his left hand, some tingling and slight pain in right hand, pain was located between thumb, index finger and middle finger and started to get more and more severe he couldn&#39;t sleep at night, and it&#39;s more like numbness and burning, a sharp pain in that location between those fingers and thumb, and the tips of his index finger are completely numb and very sore, almost like a burn, it feels like a severe burn on his finger. He was thinking it is not a joint pain, but some kind of neurological thing. It involves his thumb, index and middle finger more than anything, it is a sharp pain in his hand between those fingers. He said that he also felt it in his right hand but it was not as pronounced. It was noted on 10Feb2021, and was pretty severe for two days, now he is experiencing it, he had it last night, it is going on today, and it&#39;s more becoming more a stiffness, more like it is hard to bend his fingers, and the burning sensation is in all 3 fingers between mostly in the last joint of those fingers. He was thinking it has something to do with the sinuses in his wrist. It felt more like a nerve pain with a lot of tingling, burning feeling rather than an achy joint pain. It was reported that his wife has osteoporosis. The patient was very sensitive to aspirin, he can take a half dose to what normal people require twice as much as him Baby aspirin looks like 200mg for him, so he tries to stick to Aspirin, as it has less side effects than other pain killers. Also has a higher dose of 325mg he can take, he probably did take one of those the second day after vaccination, it&#39;s a 325mg tablet by mouth. It was further stated that when patient was younger, he was given a smallpox vaccination, it never took, they tried again, a few years later, it never took, he must have had an immunity to small pox. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Also appeared in blotches on torso.  Urgent care doctor was not sure what it was and prescribed Clobetasol Propionate Cream and said to see my dermatologist.  In the meantime it got worse and I saw the dermatologist the next day, 20April.  He prescribed a short course of Prednisone.  The symptoms have now greatly diminished.

                                                A couple of days after the Vaccination, when showering I noticed several strands of Hair down the sides of my face. Didn&#39;t think much of it at the time. It kept happening every day in the shower on an increasing basis. To the Point that half my hair had fallen out and left a Bald spot on the Lower portion of the Back of my Head. I got a Haircut 2 1/2 weeks after the Vaccination and my Barber who has cut my hair for 40 years, said &#34;What happened to your hair? Last time I cut your hair I had a Dust Pan full of clippings.&#34; I refused that take the Second Vaccination. My hair has stopped falling out, but it is very Thin now.

The patient had his second shot last sunday and had a discussion had with his doctor&#39;s nurse this morning that centered around people taking the Moderna and had some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or some-thing like that and he wanted to call about what had happened. He has had overlapping stuff from cer-vical stenosis that manifests on the left side on his shoulder arm and hands and also about a year and half ago Oct2019 he had shingles in his ear and mouth on the left side of face. He had Bell&#39;s palsy and Ramsey Hunt syndrome number 2. He had paralysis, droopy mouth, eye wouldn&#39;t close, vertigo, ear issues, hearing drop and that recovered which was weird. He went to physical therapy until early last year before COVID then he was steered away from that. About 10 months ago some of the symptoms came back in a odd way. His eye had the feeling like it couldn&#39;t close. His eyelids had at night the muscles in his face on the left side face felt taut. The inside of his gum felt like his skin was thicker, he was not sure it was the sensation and that never went away. With the shingles he had an issue where down the side of his tongue was tingly, these things overlap and it was either very little or really an-noying. In last 10 months it had got quite a bit better until about 5-6 weeks ago it was back to where it was, it was just annoying on and off. Then he got the shot sunday, and it was weird at first, he was writing it off as both stress and relief and other things. He was not dizzy and that evening the left side of his mouth went bonkers, it wound up being like when the shingles were acting up on the inside of his mouth it felt tingly and weird, and it was confined to the left half of his face and nothing else. He did not have droopiness or any Bell&#39;s palsy kind of thing had gone away the Ramsey-Hunt syndrome, he says it was a series of things and he has number 2, he does not know what the other ones are, but it was something that comes along with the chicken pox or the herpes zoster virus. The stenosis, the cervical stenosis, the left is the main problem, but the right was not far behind with regard to nerve compression, the right does not bother him as much in the way of tingling and numbness. The weird thing is he had his hands sitting in his lap and he moved his thumb towards his forefinger, there was a couple inches between and it felt like there was a rubber band pulling his thumb back, it happened 2-3 times he was fooling around with it and it went away, the sensation was still there a little in the back ground, the rest of him the right side of him was fine and today is a lot better like he said things over lap so he is not saying anything has anything to do with the vaccine but he is operating under the as-sumption that if Moderna patients are having some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or something similar, if he has left over inflammation and in Nov2019, he had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), when he first got sick and then he had another one done and his neurologist said on an unspecified date in Aug that he still sees some nerve inflammation particularly down jaw line, he saw inflammation from 2019 to 2020 he still seen inflammation and the upper part of his eye, the brow seems to behave as if there may be some inflammation running through it. His hand on the right is not doing the thing is his left thumb, it is being weird and the thing sunday night with his mouth. He thinks the whole idea is that the vaccine wakes up the immune system and gets it to recognize the RNA for COVID and generate anti-bodies and if it is acting like inflammation gets the body&#39;s attention, he is not a biologist but maybe it also caught on to his nerve inflammation and took a look at his nerves and cause them to bounce around and have other things occur that were more intense and he was trying to report to let some-one know that the underlying things left over from his shingles, he does not know about the rest of it because sleeping wrong could affect his neck shoulders and arms, he was not sure if it could be an is-sue with the vaccine, there was no clear definite thing, but the thing sunday night with his mouth was definitely far more, he thought this was the way he felt in his mouth a couple weeks after he got the shingles diagnosis like he had hives on inside of his cheek and tongue, it was crazy with extra salivation but he did not have the hives. The last time he got a vaccine it was the Shingrix it was probably too late last year, he got pretty sick off of it with flu like symptoms but he doesn&#39;t ever want another run in with shingles. It was his second COVID 19 vaccine he got 07Mar and it was the same day that the thing with his mouth happened and that was the most noticeable aspect of it, if he had not had the vaccine he would be sitting here right now just thinking he was having a bad day it runs down the left side of his tongue and stops smack in middle of the front of it. It jumps over sometimes but he was not sure if the nerve endings go on both sides of the tip of tongue or not. It has improved since sunday there was a span there where it was pretty annoying and he commented that he feels like it did when he first had shingles and over a period of time when he went to bed, whenever that was, it abated a bit. His second dose was EN6203 and it is dated Jun2021. The patient was sure they were trained to draw up the exact correct amount in there but he did not ask to look at it, it did not even occur to him. The only other thing is he was diabetic, he takes no medications for that it was diet and exercise controlled both of which COVID has been horrible for, his weight has gone up because they have a tough climate there, it has been cold for 2.5 months. It was finally starting to get a little better but the primary things he would have would be blood pressure, he takes medication for and the same for lipids he takes Simvastatin for that, the things many males his age are taking medication for. He also takes Alprazolam and Xanax to get to sleep at night, because his brain doesn&#39;t want to shut off, cost of being an engi-neer. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, the thing never changed since, it never showed up anywhere else. he does not know if that disappears but he never ended up getting it again. Apparently it shows up frequently in lungs but it did not with him. Those 2 things would be the top of the list type of things for him. He has never had cancer or blood disease, he had mononucleosis in college. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerized tomogram there was nothing left on. He had one case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, magnetic res-onance imaging was an unknown results on Nov2019. He first got sick and then he had another one done , x-ray: there was nothing left on an unknown date. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncov-ered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

He&#39;s tried heating pads and everything. Its his left arm.If he moves a certain way his arm hurts. Is this something to worry about. He&#39;s read that some people who received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine had blood clots. The sore arm never actually went away but it was easier for him to put up with. Then all of a sudden it came back worse. It&#39;s not affecting him unless he moves a certain way and that&#39;s when his arm starts acting up and it started getting worse. He had gone to the emergency department recently because he was having congestion, spitting out phlegm, and a cough in Apr 2021. He was tested for the Covid 19 virus there.

                                                Besides just having a sore arm at point of injection, I have had a pox come up on my right forearm. I did have my first shingles shot on November 18th, 2020 at the clinic here. I think it is a single pox and thought I would bring it to your attention. I have had the shingles before so I know what they look like and feel like. Since there is only one, I don&#39;t plan on going to my dermatologist to confirm that it is a pox plus I am not sure if the Covid shot is a side effect that caused the pox or not. It is not painful although itching and not responding much to antiseptic cream. I plan to go for my second Covid shot on January 26 and I am looking forward to it. I don&#39;t go for my second Shingles shot until February 17. There is a possibility that it could be something else besides a pox but wanted to bring it to your attention just in case. Thanks.

A contactable consumer reported that a 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Batch/lot number: ELO142, via an unspecified route of administration from 13Jan2021 11:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included haemochromatosis diagnosed in the mid 90&#39;s and wa reported as hereditary it was too much iron in the blood, he goes once a month for therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce the iron in the blood; very rare bacterial infection called Arupense from an unknown; he has a slight case of asthma but mentioned that it was related to living on the coast with the mold and moisture and also has a little wheezing. Concomitant medications included ethambutol, montelukast, pravastatin, amlodipine; hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN (E.C.) and rifampin for infection and blood pressure medications.  Patient had the first dose of the vaccine yesterday 13Jan2021. He has no discomfort, but at the site where the shot was administered, he has some red streaks running from the site up to his neck and shoulder. It was very small. It looks like if he took a ball point pin and drew some lines. However, the patient&#39;s wife said it was bigger than a ball point pen. It was jagged lines. The one at the injection site itself, the injection site swelling was about the size of a dime, a red area. He only discovered the red streaks about an hour ago on 14Jan2021, so there has not been no radical change. Patient has concerns; he wanted to know if he should seek medical advice. &#34;Is it just a rash?&#34;, he asked. His doctor doesn&#39;t know about this yet.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on the lot/batch number has been obtained.

                                                I had about 24 hours of symptoms, starting on the evening of the vax:  Bad headache, overall fatigue, body aches, weakness in legs and knees, tenderness on the shoulder at the point of injection.  The headache responded to an extra tablet of acetaminophen, beyond my normal 1-a-day dosage.   The symptoms are now totally gone after 48 hours.  No need for further consultation or a physician call or visit, in my judgement.

The pain was so severe, he saw Doctor 1/28/21 and was diagnosed with shingles. The rash remained localized to his right arm only. Treated with anti-inflammatories and pain medication. He called Medical Center to inform us he could not return 2/11 for his second vaccination due to the shingles - another person had also called with same complaint (VAERS form submitted) so a decision was made to enter both of these variances.

A 72-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 17:00 (at 72-year-old) at single dose (Left Arm) for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included type 2 diabetes (he uses insulin for this), bladder cancer (he was a former bladder cancer patient). Concomitant medication included insulin for Type 2 diabetes. Patient had the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. A week later, he had developed a rash and it turned into shingles. It is currently clearing up and he is taking medications for it. He is due for his second shot of the vaccine on 05Feb2021 and was wondering if there are any recommendations for him not to take it. It was clarified that on 22Jan2021 a rash developed on his face which was found to be shingles. He saw a personal doctor, the doctor even put him on medication. All has gone well, once he started taking the medication the shingles didn&#39;t progress and dried up and is now in the late stage of drying up. He asked if he should be reporting this, he also would like to know if he should get the second covid vaccine. The Rash started on 22Jan2021 and was on the face, hair scalp region. He specified further that the rash was located in the upper right quadrant on his face, also being on the eye lid and hairline. He added that he actually had a second doctor check this as well, because the rash was on the eyelid. His Primary Care doctor had him see a ophthalmologist. Patient clarified that he first thought it was a rash, and after he went to the Dr., she confirmed that what he had was actually the shingles. Outcome described as still with a little bit of redness, but it is healing and it is dried up. Dr prescribed him Valtrex for the shingles. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included that he has had no positive covid tests. In Dec2020, he had the regular covid test and that was negative. In early Jan2021, he had the regular covid test as well as a covid-19 antibody test, and both were negative. Patient mentioned serology test, he then confirmed that he used the word serology inadvertently, and meant antibody. He has had no issues with vaccines in the past. The outcome of the event was recovering.

In the last two weeks, I&#39;ve had intermittent cramping (arms, legs, back) after eating.    Something aggravated my IBS-C and I believe that could be the vaccination.   The cramping is still happening but not continuously.  In the last week, I&#39;ve had tingling or burning twinges on the outside of my right thigh, too, on and off.   Might have been connected with heavy keys in my right front pants pocket and a cell phone on my belt near the thigh.   The same meals that cause cramping seem to cause the tingling, but I don&#39;t know if there is a connection.  The tingling may be from Meralgia paresthetica.

A 72-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 04Feb2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9262) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus Had this for 7-8 years. There were no concomitant medications. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was none. The event reported was severe right shoulder pain near the point of injection, to the point he cant move the arm and it is very stiff. Caller states his pain level was a 9-10 but then corrected this to say it was actually an 8 out of 10 or maybe a little better. The arm pain started on the day he got the injection, 04Feb2021, around 6pm and was noticed to be severe the next day, 05Feb2021. At this point, the pain is about the same since getting severe. He had been taking ibuprofen which he had taken 5 times and acetaminophen which he had taken once. The patient had also used ice and heat for the pain. He also experienced malaise which was very minor. This started the after the shot and he just didn&#39;t feel good that day. It resolved that a same day. The caller&#39;s wife explained that the pain was so intense it was causing him to be close to screaming because he cant use it, and that is not like him. He explained that he is hoping it will get better soon. It was worse at night, it started out ok in the morning but as the day progresses it build up. Caller asked how long will this last. Caller received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Dose 1 last Thursday, 4FEB2021 and is scheduled for their Dose 2 on 25FEB2021. Caller reported to have experienced severe arm pain at the injection site. They wanted to know how long does this side effect usually last and what he should do about the side effects, whether he could proceed with the 2nd shot. AE(s) did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. Relevant Tests was none. No Investigation Assessment. Outcome of the event malaise was recovered on 05Feb2021 and other events was not recovered.

                                                Blood clot in right lung; Sore left arm at injection site; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose intramuscular, administered in the left upper arm on 03Feb2021 at 09:00 (batch/lot number: EL3248) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (prevention). Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from Dec2009 to an unknown date (takes daily pills for rheumatoid arthritis), squamous cell lung cancer early stage from Aug2018 to an unknown date, lung surgery to remove small portion of that and went on chemo in Aug2018, skin cancers prior to getting the vaccine, reading glasses (he needed prior to getting vaccine), blood pressure (abnormal) (takes blood pressure medication; takes daily pills). Family medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included nivolumab (OPDIVO) taken for squamous cell lung cancer early stage from 17Jan2019 to an unspecified stop date (getting it every 4 weeks for 2 years and 3 months; the bag was 480 ml); and unspecified blood pressure medication and rheumatoid arthritis medication. The patient experienced blood clot in right lung on 25Feb2021, sore left arm at injection site on 03Feb2021 and shortness of breath on Feb2021. The patient had the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 03Feb2021 and second one on 01Mar2021. He did not really have any special events but then he had a CT scan on 23Feb2021, which was about 20 days after first shot. When he went in for doctor&#39;s meeting a couple of days later, they said he had a blood clot in right lung. He later stated he was not positive it was in the right lung. He told his doctor that he just got the shot, but they said they had not heard of any reports from Pfizer of people getting blood clots in their lungs after getting it. He thought about reporting then, but did not. He has no evidence that the blood clot in his lung was related to the vaccine. He was also a lung cancer patient and was on an immune therapy drug nivolumab from (name). He has been on it for over 2 years and started Jan2019. He was diagnosed with cancer back in Aug2018. It was squamous cell lung cancer early stage. He had lung surgery to remove small portion of that in Aug2018 and went on chemo. On 17Jan2019, he started on nivolumab immune therapy drug. Fortunately, it worked extremely well. He immediately started recovering and was feeling better. The last few CT scans indicated he had no sign of disease. It does not mean he was cured, but was healthy otherwise. The nivolumab spurred his immune system to eat the cancer cells. It stimulates your immune system. It has been a pretty successful drug and has been on the market for about 5-6 years. He and his wife both got shot on same date. The word on the street was that you should ask for Pfizer because it seems to have less side effects that people can get for vaccines. Pfizer&#39;s reputation has been known for having less common serious side effects. He had a sore arm and it went away about a day later. They prescribed rivaroxaban (XARELTO), a blood thinner, for his blood clot which he went on and got on a day or two later. He was hoping it was gone. He feels better. At the time, he did not know he had the blood clot. He visits his doctor for treatment for nivolumab every 4 weeks and every 4 months, they do a CT scan. At his last visit, he reported that he was still fine but lately experienced some shortness of breath. It was occasional and it comes and goes and was not all the time. He plays golf and noticed the shortness of breath during his game. He quit a couple of holes early and did not want to take any chances. The doctor later told him that a blood clot in your lung can contribute to shortness of breath. When he started rivaroxaban it was 2 pills a day for about 2-3 weeks and it was a starter dose. It was a little more in the beginning. He thinks it was 10 mg twice daily and then it went to 1 tablet a day for the last week at dinner and now it was 15 mg once daily. The two combined were greater to jump start you. It was not a special dose. He then corrected dose to 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily for the starter dose for 2-3 weeks and one tablet daily for the last week of the starter. Then he switched to maintenance dose of 20 mg daily. He did not have a lot or expiration for the previous dose of 15 mg. The lot and expiration for the 20 mg was unknown because he believes the label was covering it. He stated he needed to get his glasses to read bottle. They were reading glasses and he needed prior to getting vaccine. Nothing has changed with his vision. He was hoping to get off of them and has never been on them. He hopes it was not a long term thing. Second dose was given 01Mar2021, Pfizer COVID vaccine, BNT162B2, expiration was unknown. Injected in left upper arm in the muscle (intramuscularly). Second dose administered at 09:20-09:30. He takes blood pressure medication and did not see it was relevant. Takes daily pills for that and rheumatoid arthritis. In the past, he had a few skin cancers. All were prior to getting the vaccine. They were some squamous and basal cell. He has had nothing in quite a while. Nivolumab was helping skin issues. Squamous cell skin cancer was the same family as lung cancer. He did not have a lot or expiration for the nivolumab. He received it by IV infusion. Shortness of breath was mid Feb2021, on and off for a couple of weeks prior to doctor visit on 25Feb2021. He usually does not have much to report and mentioned it. It did not prevent him from doing anything and was not debilitating. One of his fellow golfers said he was huffing and puffing and he just poo pooed it away. He had a flu vaccine in Oct2021 (as reported). No further details provided. Blood clots in right lung morning time, unknown time. Sore left arm at injection site noon - to late in the day of the shot. Shortness of breath - sometimes he feels it in the morning or midday if active. He cannot say a straight time. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office visit required. Vaccination facility type was clinic. Not a military facility. On 25Feb2021, normally scheduled office visit and did the CT scan on 23Feb2021. He went in separate for that. He had the treatment on Thursday. He has another CT scan scheduled in third week of May2021. They were doing it early because of the blood clot. Hopefully, it was gone by then. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks): 1st and 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine as mentioned above. CT scan on 23Feb2021, positive for small blood clot in single vessel in what he thinks was his right lung. All of his previous trouble with the lung cancer was in his right lung. He has never heard of anyone else having blood clots related to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He does not think he has heard of any and wanted to know if there were any. He knows there was something in the press about the (name) vaccine with blood clots. When you do 120 million and have a handful of people, you may have a few things. He did not have any information on the people for (name) to report on. He knows of others who have had the vaccine and no one had any symptoms. No further details provided. The outcome was recovered on 04Feb2021 for the event &#34;sore left arm at injection site&#34;; recovering for the event &#34;shortness of breath&#34;; and unknown for the event &#34;blood clot in right lung&#34;.

A 72-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered at an unspecified anatomical location on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 72-year-old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. The patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered at an unspecified anatomical location on 18Feb2021 (age at vaccination was unknown) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. He received both Pfizer vaccines. The first one on 28Jan2021 and second one on 18Feb2021. The reporter stated that he believed the first shot was not administered correctly because of the way it was done. He watched them inject the solution and stated that it was supposed to be in the deltoid and if it was not in the muscle and was in the subcutaneous fat it will not be effective, and he did not believe it was effective. He stated that he thinks the first shot may have not been administered correctly and he didn&#39;t think that he had got the effect of the vaccine like it should be. He didn&#39;t have any side effects. He didn&#39;t think the first one was even working because he didn&#39;t think it was administered correctly, he didn&#39;t think it was administered into the muscle and it was administered into the fatty portion of his arm and the shot was administered too quickly. It was way too fast and did not believe they could have put anything in. He received this in (State) and it was administered in a high school where there were no people in there other than the national guard and the people bringing it in and making sure it was mixed and at the right temperature. The person who administered it may not have been well-trained so they may have put it in too fast. He stated the second dose was done nicely. He stated he had no other side effects other than his arm was a little sore where the needle went in. He asked whether he could get a third shot to make up for the first one that did not work. Now he watched people getting the vaccine on TV in other places and they seem to take little bit of time to inject it. This was just like in and out so fast. The second one was great. He asked so, if he get a third shot, is it dangerous or will that be okay. The reporter wanted to know if it is safe if he receives a third dose of the vaccine because he thinks the first one does not count, so it would be like getting 2 doses. He stated he already checked with a medical provider and they don&#39;t have any knowledge of how to use it. He also contacted the CDC. He tried to contact the Chief Medical Officer of Pfizer, but he is no longer the chief medical officer. After a verbal response was provided, he stated he is just going to get the third dose and will tell them if he dies, they should just call us but then said he was kidding. He said he can sign up for the vaccine, it is very easy, he just has to say he is getting his first shot. The reporter stated it is really frustrating to not be able to get studies done on this [a need for a third dose if a first dose is invalid]. He stated, since he couldn&#39;t get any info ourselves, he guess he will have to be the guinea pig. He stated you can always pass this on to the higher ups. He wanted to know if a third dose would be safe to get or if it would potentially kill him. The reporter stated that J&amp;J stopped giving their vaccine because they are having so many people coming down with adverse side effects. They were trying to keep up with Pfizer and Moderna and came out with it too quickly. Limited information was available over the call.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (12Apr2021): New information received from a contactable consumer in response to Non-HCP letter sent to consumer included: Updated the clinical details.

A 72-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 04Feb2021 at 14:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hospitalized for pneumonia in Sep2020 and treated with &#34;mega-doses&#34; of prednisone, antibiotics (unspecified) and oxygen wherein he recovered, came off oxygen for 1.5 months, but then after Christmas 2020, went back on the oxygen, from 07Jan2021 through 12Jan2021 the patient was hospitalized again and CT scans and cultures were performed on his lungs which returned a diagnosis of MAC complex.  The patient is awaiting treatment for this after lung cultures mature. The patient also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing diagnosed 20 years ago, congestive heart failure (CHF), stomach issues, rash also on a portion of his face and eye sensitivity all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient also had a heart attack and a triple bypass in May2020 and ongoing diverticulitis that has been going on forever since an unknown date. The patient is taking &#34;a lot of other meds&#34; (unspecified) for heart, lungs and digestive things. The patient previously got a regular flu shot (unspecified) and got feverish, chills, achy and his arm hurts. After the patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 04Feb2021, that day and night he had no symptoms. On 05Feb2021, the patient developed an itchy, burning, rash everywhere but legs and feet that &#34;almost felt like shingles&#34;, which escalated over 5 days, tapered off a little on Wednesday, Thursday it was receding, by Friday 12Feb2021 it was basically gone.  The patient went to a dermatologist office and they did not know about the rash. He called his pulmonologist and they told him not to get the second dose due to his underlying conditions. He was in the hospital back in Jan2021 and they found something on his lung and he is now working with infectious disease people, they told him to see an allergist, he cancelled his appointment for the second dose. The patient wants to know if this rash is being reported and was hoping that maybe someone would have seen or heard of something like this. The patient also reported that he has a lessened sense of taste that started on an unspecified date, around Tuesday, and he has had some difficulty breathing during all of this as well, unsure if it is related to the vaccine or his underlying condition. The outcome of difficulty breathing and lesser sense of taste was not recovered. The outcome of the event almost felt like shingles was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

In any case after 3-4 days when I got up in the morning and noticed some white spots on my left and right hand and since then I went to visit the my regular doctor and he told me that he can not do anything. In his opinion the Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine may have reacted. If you have any idea what is this and why this has happened, would love to hear from you Many thanks

A 72-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 20May2021 15:00 (Lot Number: EWO161; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing conditions of acid reflux, borderline high blood pressure, borderline cholesterol, pre-existing condition of arthritis (wrist and elbow) and diverticulitis. Family Medical History Relevant to AEs were none and any relevant tests were none. Concomitant medication included omeprazole taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing; atorvastatin calcium taken for blood cholesterol from an unspecified start date and ongoing; carvedilol taken for blood pressure measurement from an unspecified start date and ongoing. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect were none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect were none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were none (Patient stated when he takes the flu vaccine, he gets the flu, but he hasn&#39;t had one in a long time and he had the pneumonia vaccine and that was fine). The patient wanted to know if the second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine can be taken later than 3 weeks and if the AEs that he experienced would be a restriction in getting the second shot of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The patient wanted to know how long his reported AEs usually lasted based on Pfizer studies after the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, if the side effects that he experienced are included in the commonly reported adverse events after getting the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. The patient said that after he got first shot for the vaccine, it was going good and then the next day where the shot was given, it started aching. The patient experienced injection site pain and different aches and pains, and back pain on 21May2021, muscle pain and joint pain a few days after getting the vaccine. The patient stated when that started, it trigged his arthritis in his right wrist, and he had joint aches. He said that can happen too and said it would go away but it did not, and it played around and made his joints ache and then it went away. He also experienced the pain on the left extremity, but it was the right arm was mostly his concern. He also stated that the pain somehow messed with his ankle joints and is also considering that this may be related to his pre-existing condition of arthritis (wrist and elbow). He stated that these AEs comes and goes away but was something that is persistent and that got him concerned about. The patient said that next morning it came back again, not heavy or as bad but off and on and kept changing. He stated that he uses his arm and exercises it and keeps using it. He stated that he also experienced nausea (5 or 6 days after the shot) and upset stomach but is mostly concerned with the arm, join and muscle pain which was predominantly felt on his right extremity where he got his vaccine shot. The patient stated that nausea could be part of his acid indigestion stuff, and that if he eats, it goes away. Patient stated the first time he had the nausea was the worst and after that, it was just kind of there, like a bad upset stomach. When he eats, it was all right again and that he can&#39;t be on an empty stomach and he can&#39;t eat a large amount. Patient said he takes medications for acid reflux and diverticulitis and he has to keep eating regularly and stated that the arm pain has never went away and it was still there. The patient did not have any emergency room/ physician office visit. The outcome of injection site pain (it doesn&#39;t stop him from doing anything) and different aches and pains, and back pain, nausea, upset stomach was not recovered. The outcome of muscle pain and joint pain was unknown. Therapeutic measures included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), 650 mg (Expiration: Jul2023 Lot: SJA033) for different aches and back pain which helped some but didn&#39;t take it all away. The patient was about to receive his second shot on 10Jun2021.

By morning it was fading away and within 24 hours rash was gone with slight lump that gradually faded away over the next 24 hours. There may have been a slight red flushing lower inner surface of the same arm that still seems to be there, but no elevated temperature, tenderness or significant redness compared to the original localized rash. The injection site never reddened but had a slight tenderness for 24-48 hours.

Most welts subsided within a few hours.  Took another 50 mg of Benadryl Saturday night. Still have a few small areas of redness. Between the time of vaccination and outbreak, I did not eat anything new, no new clothes detergent, no changes.

                                                rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pneumonia, penicillin allergy, diabetec and high blood pressure from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included potassium citrate, tamsulosin, glipizide, magnesium sulfate, (6s)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate glucosamine, mecobalamin, pyridoxal phosphate, thioctic acid (PODIAPN), dulaglutide (TRULICITY), carvedilol, rosuvastatin, furosemide, acetylsalicylic acid (BAYER ASPIRIN) , valsartan, ubidecarenone (COQ-10), fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide, vilanterol trifenatate (TRELEGY ELLIPTA), salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA) and apixaban (ELIQUIS). The patient previously took amoxicillin at 1 DF, 2x/day (one tablet by mouth every 12 hours), azithromycin at 250 mg (250mg, take two tablets by mouth and then one tablet by mouth for four days) and prednisone at 20 mg (20mg, three pills daily for three days then two pills daily for four days). It was reported that the patient had rash toes up to neck. The patient&#39;s wife was wondering if it was normal for his husband to experience rashing after getting the vaccine. The patient had a rash that started from his feet. It looks like sunburn. It is going up his legs, body, and chest. It started the day after the vaccine. Two weeks ago he went to his pulmonary doctor and he had pneumonia. They gave him prednisone, Amoxicillin, and Azithromycin and both are forms of penicillin which he is allergic to. He hasn&#39;t taken it in years. The doctor knew that. She is not sure if the rash if from that. He ended those medications the Friday before the vaccine, 08Jan2021. She is confused. Everyone she calls says they are not sure if it was the medications or the shot. She is trying to get a dermatologist to see the patient. The rash started on 16Jan2021. It has progressively gotten worse. She is wondering if the patient should go back on the fifth for the second vaccine. She is assuming it is the medication. The nurses and doctor don&#39;t know. They said take him to the ER. He is not having trouble breathing. If he was having trouble breathing she would take him to the ER. She can&#39;t get anyone to look at the rash. She didn&#39;t do anything. He is supposed to get the second dose on 05Feb2021. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                The day after the vaccination ( Monday, 2/14) I was lethargic  when I got up in the morning and by mid afternoon I had a fever of 100 degrees (orally).  I took 2 extra strength tylenol around 4 pm and 2 more when I went to sleep around 10:30 pm. I felt much better when I woke up on Sunday(no lethargy, didn?t feel feverish) but around 2 pm I noticed a red, blotches rash all around my neck, and my upper torso. There?s was also a rash on  the right side of my upper back. I called my PCP but the office was closed for President?s Day. I didn?t feel that the symptoms warranted going to the ER, but I took 2 25mg tabs of Benadryl at 3 pm. It is now 7 pm and the rash on my neck and upper torso looks unchanged but, I also noticed it had spread to the crook of both elbows Otherwise, still feel fine. Body temperature is 98.9 orally, which is slightly higher than my normal temperature, which tends to be around 98 degrees. I  had a similar, but, much more severe reaction to Ibuprofen about 10 years ago, though it started out in similar fashion and got progressively worse over 3 - 4 days. I had to go on a regimen of Prednisone for 2 weeks to bring it under control

                                                whole back and side of his right leg was covered with very large, itchy welts from his right buttocks down to his right ankle; small itchy areas on the front of his right leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife).  A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL3249, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at 16:30 at a single dose on the left deltoid (reported as &#39;left shoulder&#39;) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks before the COVID-19 vaccine. It was reported that the patient initially had no problem after receiving his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine, but on 23Jan2021 (also reported as 2-1/2 days later), he woke up in the middle of the night, at approximately 3:00am, and the whole back and side of his right leg was covered with very large, itchy welts from his right buttocks down to his right ankle. The patient also had some small itchy areas on the front of his right leg, but no other parts of his body. She said she gave her husband Benadryl 50mg, and put some hydrocortisone cream on his welts, and that seemed to take care of the welts. The reporter told her brother about the welts her husband (patient) developed after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said her brother was questioning if maybe her husband had a delayed reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her brother said her husband&#39;s welts may have been caused by spiked proteins developing from the COVID-19 Vaccine administration. The reporter asked if it is safe for the patient to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, which he is scheduled to receive on 10Feb2021. The patient took 2 Welby generic Benadryl 25mg capsules (lot number: 9DR0738, expiry date: Dec2020) when he first discovered the large, itchy welts on the back and side of his right leg. Then the patient took another 2 Welby generic Benadryl 25mg capsules before he went to bed later that day.  The reporter topically applied the product &#34;After Bite&#34; to the patient&#39;s itchy welts. The reporter clarified that After Bite (lot number: 32812) is not hydrocortisone cream, like she thought, but a Sodium Bicarbonate and Aloe Vera product. The reporter added that the patient&#39;s very large, itchy welts are very faded on the back and side of his right leg, but there remains a couple small spots. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Uneasy sleep, awoke the following morning in a sweat, with overall discomfort and nausea, began to retch and vomit for nearly 13 hrs. throughout the only comfort was to sit in a hot shower till the hot water ran out sometime falling into a deep sleep, I did this many times through the day, Accompanying this was a general fog and complete loss of equilibrium, extreme weakness. this made it difficult to move from bed to bath or anywhere in my home. I am writing this at 5:13 am Mar  6 and find it hard to gather thoughts.

                                                I got my 1st Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination on 3/4/2021. No real adverse effects immediately - just a little sore right arm at the injection site and a watery, runny nose a day or so later that eventually stopped. I have allergies so I&#39;m used to the runny nose symptom. However, on Monday evening, March 15, I noticed some slight pain where my lymph nodes are located underneath my jaw and close to my ear on the right side. There was a small lump that was tender to the touch, about the size of a small raisin or grape, under my jaw along my neck on the right side. To a much lesser extent, and barely noticeable, in a similar location, on my left side as well. I went to my primary care physician the next day, 3/16, who confirmed that I had swollen lymph nodes - and also told me they could notice them further down my neck as well, which I was not aware of previously. I had no other symptoms, e.g., no temperature, etc. They said that, yes, the swollen lymph nodes appeared to be consistent with earlier reports of swollen lymph nodes as a resulting side effect in some patients following a Covid19 vaccination, but also mentioned that often, this side effect was more noticeable several days after the vaccination. Since my swollen lymph nodes occurred nearly 10 days later, my PCP team said to go ahead and get the 2nd Pfizer vaccination as scheduled 3/25/21, but to return to their office two weeks later for another checkup to make sure there weren&#39;t any other issues going on.

A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 07Mar2021 at 14:45 (02:45 pm) at the age of 73-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at the facility. The patient did not receive other vaccines on the same date. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and Sweet&#39;s Syndrome. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate (AMLODIPINE), lenalidomide (REVLIMID), prednisone, danazol, and clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX); all taken for unspecified indications, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6201) on 14Mar2021 (as reported; pending clarification) at 02:45 pm at the left arm for COVID-19 Immunization. The patient also previously took levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) and valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX) and experienced allergies with both drugs. The patient reported that as a person with MDS and Sweet&#39;s Syndrome, he has had a history of experiencing major skin outbreaks but it has been under control for over a year with oral meds. Two days after his 2nd injection he experienced a major Sweet&#39;s Syndrome skin outbreak. Apparently, the vaccine reacted with his autoimmune system to trigger a reaction. The injection area was red about the size of a softball with large swollen, red, erythema migrants rash on chest, left arm, with smaller lesions on his neck, face &amp; back. Once the symptoms appeared, the outbreak followed its normal course of action. It took about 5 days to reach its apex; thereafter the symptoms began to slowly subside. He is now into day 9 and have light rashes. By day 12 he expects all traces of the rash to be completely gone. Patient&#39;s assessment: he was not allergic to the vaccine but the vaccine set off his immune system. If/when the rash took longer than the normal 6 days to reach its apex, he was prepared to significantly increase his Prednisone. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and post vaccination. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The onset of events was on 09Mar2021 at 21:00 (09:00 pm) with outcome of recovering.

Scratching makes it worse leading to red raised bumps and worse itching. My primary care physician has treated the symptoms with Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP, 0.025% plus additional instructions per online conversation: Instructions - Suggest using Dove or Aveeno soap. * Switched to Dove. Works OK - Suggest using Sarna lotion. * Have been using a Loreal Moisture cream on non-affected areas. - Consider Benadryl at bedtime and Zyrtec during the day (if itchiness is intolerable). * Have been taking Zyrtec. - Return if symptoms worsen or fail to improve.

Two weeks later:  Noticed a low-grade headache in the front of my head, assumed it was allergies as usual for this time of year, and started taking Zyrtec, but this has made no difference compared to past years. This has continued more or less daily, with onset in the afternoon (around 3:00 or so) and evening (around 9:00 or so). Headache is not too bad, but very noticeable (about 4 on a scale of 1 to 10). I take two Advil in the afternoon and that helps, but maybe only until evening when I have another headache.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), dose 1 intramuscular on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 vaccination; adalimumab (HUMIRA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1132646) to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose, subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1136949) to Mar2021, at unspecified dose for moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.  The patient medical history includes ear infection. Concomitant medications were not reported. On unknown dates, the patient experienced tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles and whole left side of face and eye swollen. In 2021, the patient experienced infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy and whole left side of face and eye swollen. On 02Mar2021, the patient experienced felt weakness and chills. On 08Apr2021, the patient experienced substantial bubble of pus under arm. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit. In Apr2021, the substantial bubble of pus under arm resolved. On unknown dates, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears and whole left side of face and eye swollen resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. In Feb2021, the patient saw his physician twice for an ear infection. On 01Mar2021, the patient got his first vaccine shot. The next day he had chills and fever and feeling of weakness the next day. He went away after a short time and he felts better. He went to the physician twice in the past two weeks for minor infections especially in his ears. The tissue inside his ear dried up and bleeding. On the first visit he had a fever due to the infection in the ear. His physician prescribed antibiotic for a week. He got another infection in the same ears. He was painful when touched it. He went back to physician and physician prescribed another anitbiotic. The physician said the infections were to be expected with Humira because Humira weakens immune system. Partly because of his age. His age may be a contributing factor as well. He agrees to have physician contacted. On 29Mar2021 to 1Apr2021, he was in the hospital his infection started in his ear lobe that migrated to his whole left side of his face. His eye was swollen and felt pain on top of his head. His Temp of 105 when he went in. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics. He was tested to make sure infection had not spread to blood or bones. The Humira might have played a role because it lowers the bodies resistance to infection. They asked him not to take the Humira for two Saturdays. He did not take Humira on 09Apr2021 or before. He was stable. His skin was cracking up. Thought it might be shingles. He was prescribed an oral antibiotic first time, but then a week and a half later, it acted up again and he went back and got a different antibiotic and that worked until it. He was feeling completely better since he got out of the hospital. He had more energy than he had in a while. He had been feeling low energy for a while due to the infection. His physician did not think he should stop taking Humira but if he got a fever he needs to investigate immediately to see if he needs to hospitalized. In 08Apr2021, he had substantial bubble of puss under his arm. He gave him a steroid injection to control that. On 10Apr2021, he had thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of his armpit and he thinks that was the end of it. On 11Apr2021, he had his second Covid vaccine manufactured by Moderna then after he was released from the hospital. He was no issues or reactions with either injection. He was careful when he went out around people. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. The action taken in response to the events adalimumab was not applicable. The outcome of event infection in ear lobe, eye swelling and swelling face recovered in 2021, weakness and chills and fever recovered in Mar2021, ear infection and pain localised recovered on unspecified date, Axillary abscess/substantial bubble of puss under arm recovered in Apr2021; event ear bleeding was recovering; event fluid discharge, skin fissures and shingles was unknown.  The reporter&#39;s causality for adalimumab (Humira) on the events infection in ear lobe, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset with Humira (Adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of felt weakness and chills with Humira (Adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, skin was cracking up and possible shingles was not provided.  Opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab). Opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of felt weakness, chills, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset and tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pfizer comment: The serious events Ear lobe infection and Condition aggravated were considered as unlikely related to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of BNT162b2 cannot be completely excluded for the non-serious asthenia, pyrexia and chills, which occurred in a close temporal relation, namely, one day after the  first dose BNT162B2 injection. The other reported events were confirmed as non-serious, while the causality was confounded by ADALIMUMAB administration. The infectious events were to be expected with co-suspect due an immunosuppression activity with increased infection susceptibility, such as Herpes zoster and Ear lobe infection aggravated, in this case. Furthermore, swelling face and eye swollen with unknown onset in 2021 may be attributable to the co-suspect and unrelated to the vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I recognized it because I had had 2 previous episodes in the exact same location,  (7/15/29 and 4/15/2020 , both treated with Valtrex). These episodes prompted me to get shingles vaccine. As of this date, shingles are resolving without medical attention. I am reporting this occurrence because I noticed similar  reports in the media regarding shingles after covid vaccination.

Next two days I was fatigued and my arm hurt. After that I was ok.

After about 10 days, my feet began to swell and my toes started turning purple and black.  My feet were extremely painful and I was unable to walk.  Over 3 months after the shot I am still having trouble with my feet.

                                                Patient did not report this event to the vaccination site for several months, which is why the report is just now being submitted.  Below is the exert from an email that patient sent me.  Upon asking his PCP about the reaction, he was instructed to reach out to the vaccination site to report the event.  &#34;I received my first Pfizer shot on January 28, 2021 at 2:00PM.   felt fine when I left after the fifteen minutes waiting period.  I felt fine when I went to work the next morning.  However, when I returned home from work at about 1:00 PM I did not feel well.  My legs were very weak, upset stomach, headache, rash and some fever.  I stayed on the couch the remainder of Friday and slept,  I slept on Saturday for a total of approximately 22hrs and the same on Sunday.  I went to work on Monday even though I still did not feel very good.  It was several more days until I felt near normal.   About 10 days after the first shot, both of my feet began to swell and my toes began to turn purple and black.  My feet became extremely painful.  I went to the emergency room where they drew blood and said I had gout.  I was given a prescription for a 5 day packet of steroids.   That helped, but my feet reverted back to the swelling and extreme  pain within 1 day of no steroids.  I contacted my primary care doctor who prescribed an additional 10 day packet of steroids plus two other prescriptions that I do not remember.  I was in extreme pain and needed a walker to function.   I have had two follow up visits to my primary care doctor.  He did blood work which showed several results were outside of the normal range, however the gout indicator was within the normal range.  My RA level was 32 which is very high.  And, never have  had my RA factor number high prior to the shot.  He referred me to a RA specialist, but the appointment is still months away.     My feet are still somewhat swollen and walking is very uncomfortable and a little unsteady.  Before the shot, I was doing well.  My blood work was fine.   It has been almost 4 months and I still do not know when my feet will return to normal. I am no longer using a walker.   My Primary Care doctor advised me to report my adverse reactions.&#34;  Patient did received his 2nd Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2/25/2021.  He states he &#34;did not experience any effects from the second shot&#34;.  At this point I am not sure if the COVID-19 vaccine is the culprit with patients RA level, but did want to report this event since patient indicates the timing of the vaccination and his symptoms appear related.

The patient was scheduled for the second dose for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine tomorrow, 16Jun2021.

A 73-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 22Jan2021 (age at vaccination was 73-years) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included, prostate cancer, sensitive with food sometimes, fish allergy. There were no concomitant medications. On unspecified date, Saturday patient ate a piece of fish. He is sensitive with food sometimes. If there was bacteria, he gets a nausea feeling and he has to dry heave sort of. Patient had to do that a little bit on Saturday when he ate this fish. He had paused and then kept eating. So reporter was wondering if this onset was from that. It would have been 48 hours after. It could be possible. He had the dry heaving for about 3-4 mins. Then he kept eating. Normally that feeling is acute and will not eat. But he did not feel it again. Patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization and experienced exhausted which was resolved.

Then a week ago, they had someone helping them in their home who tested positive for COVID last Thursday. Reporter and her husband (patient) were not there when she was there. Reporter herself has tested negative twice now. Her husband did not get tested as he had already completed his series of the vaccine. Today he was having diarrhea and GI discomfort. He does not have a fever. He was in bed exhausted. He also had chills. His injection site is also really sore today. He does not recall it being sore the past week or so.

Reported that patient had dint get the vaccine in his providers office, he got it from the staff where they were giving the vaccine. The hospital was giving them. Patient had no symptoms at all after receiving his second vaccine. He had a really really good workout after the vaccine. They were joking that maybe his second dose was not effective since he had no side effects. They were joking about it because he had no reaction. Then today all of those symptoms hit him. Reporter stated that she was unsure of the outcome as of now. He did some patient work this morning and then went to bed. He has felt bad all day. She knows that the second dose was given in his left arm as that was the arm that was sore today.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

                                                Per secure message sent by patient on 2/4/2021: &#34;I received my Covid shot at the clinic on January 28th. Yesterday, February 2nd, in  the late afternoon I became very red and itchy and my tongue swelled. I went to  the emergency room where they gave me sodium chloride, Benadryl,  Pepcid and 2 &#34;epi&#34; shots. After about 4 hours I was sent home. Could that have  been a reaction to my Covid vaccine? Today I am tired but fine and swelling is  gone. I had told the person who scheduled my first shot and the person who  vaccinated me that I was taking Skyrizi injections for psoriasis and had my  last injection of Skyrizi on Dec 15.&#34;

A 74-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021 at first single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included: the patient had pre-existing conditions, he was hospitalized in Dec2020 and he was undergoing a lot of testing and there was possibility that he had a form of cancer and they discovered something on the next to his lungs. The reporter stated they did not have all of the diagnosis of it yet and he was waiting to be seen for specialist. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 20Jan2021, the patient had a swelling. Swelling in the groin area above the hip. Skin is swollen and there is a lump. The reporter was trying to find out with the list of side effects if the lymph glands can swell and what areas of the body would you may be see swelling in the lymph nodes. The reporter wonder if there be lymph gland located for the men or the lymph gland located on the either side of the reproductive organ, in that area. What had happened to the patient, they were not sure if that was a side effect. One of the side effects the reporter knew it was listed on the website was lymph glands swell up. So the reporter just trying to find out if there were lymph glands in that same area where the patient was experience swelling right now. He did not have this issue before he got the vaccine, so it just sort of seemed this is. The reporter talked to the physician&#39;s office briefly when this happened just to see did they need to bring the patient in immediately for an appointment to check if it&#39;s (incomplete sentence). So far the patient just received topical ice packs over the area for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

The consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot no. E10142, via an unspecified route of administration (administered to the left arm) on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for Covid vaccination administered at facility. Medical history included 100% disabled, Covid from Jul2020, hospitalized from 21Jul2020 to 26Jul2020, blood plasma, and sore. No relevant family medical history relevant to AEs. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient previously took remdesivir. The patient called to report side effects after getting the first Pfizer COVID vaccination. He got it on 19Jan2021. He had COVID before. Last summer he hadn&#39;t left the house for 20 plus weeks and their son who was living with them brought the COVID virus in to them. His son and wife were asymptomatic and suffered at the house and he was completely disabled, with underlying conditions had to drag himself to the facility. He eventually had to be hospitalized on 21Jul2020. He had blood plasma and remdesivir and stayed in the hospital from Tuesday through Sunday. After getting the treatment, he felt like superman. On 20Jan2021, he next day, about 24 hours later he started feeling sick again, he felt like when he had COVID back in Jul2020. It lasted for 24 hours, terrible headache, chills, aches, and a little diarrhea. He said after he got the vaccine, 24 hours later, his arm got sorer and sorer. He had 99.9 F fever and a terrible headache. He also put on a little weight on an unspecified date. No emergency room visit. No relevant tests. He called the facility the next morning and they told him to rest. He slept all day and the next day he felt like superman again. He called the facility that Thursday morning and they instructed him to relax and that it seemed to affect people who have had the COVID virus before, they have that reaction, and it should subside and it did. He stated his side effects were about 20% of what they were when he actually had COVID. The clinic told him that if he had any reaction to call and that Thursday he just relaxed. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. Never had any problems with shots, not really.

A couple days later I started itching and the next Monday it was worse. I woke up  the next morning with a rash on my face, right arm, head, all over my chest moving to my legs.  It just got worse and hurt so bad, so i went to the ER right away. They put me on IV pecid and Benadryl, that didn&#39;t help. They put me on a steroid IV, tat really calmed the itching down. I was in the ER about 2 hours and then they sent me home.  They sent me home with steroid and hydroxyzine HCL -10mg  1/3x days.  It took about a week and a half for the rash to go away. I still have some itching but not a problem.

                                                About 26 hours (a Friday afternoon) after the 2nd COVID shot, I suddenly began to feel bad and found I had 2.5 degrees of fever.  My shoulder where the shot occurred became painful and a pinkish rash formed there.  The temp rose to 3.5 degrees over the next seven hours and remained that high until mid morning Saturday.  Then it oscillated between 1.0 and 3.0 degrees until Sunday morning.  Finally it began to fall and reached normal Sunday afternoon around 4 pm.  The rash disappeared on Monday and the shoulder pain stopped on Tuesday.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night. My skin began to burn. It started in my  face and slowly flowed down my body. The burning turned to itching became almost unbearable. I took a benadryl tablet and laid there waiting for it to work but it didn&#39;t help. I took another. I must have slept a couple of hours because I woke up exhausted. The benadryl had finally kicked in and made me extremely drowsy. I went to work (Wednesday morning) itching and tired. I ordered a bottle of fexafenadrine (generic allegra) and had it delivered that evening. I took benadryl again that night. The next morning (Thursday) I took the allegra and it seemed to help. I stopped itching after a few days. The next week I got the sniffles and the itching started all over again. I think the Pfizer vaccine is contraindicated for people who have Meniere&#39;s disease. The itching seems to return whenever my immune system is activated.

                                                My left arm is weaker and sore from the underside of my bicep down my arm into my ring and little finger.  This is constant.  The pain is minor but I have more significant pain when putting on a jacket or lifting something with my left hand.  The discomfort began within a week from injection into my left arm and has been daily.  It is not debilitating but is annoyingly weaker.

A 74-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9263 and Expiration Date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 17Feb2021 (at the age of 74-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Lyme disease in the past that was treated. He take no day to day medications. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that patient wanted to report experience with BNT162B2. On 17Feb2021 patient received BNT162B2 around mid-day. First day he got the COVID-19 vaccine, by late afternoon his skin was feeling very, very irritated. He was feeling irritated. Started sensing aggression and anger in himself. Couldn&#39;t get comfortable. Doesn&#39;t know if this is an expected result because he hasn&#39;t seen this. Started to get extremely tired. Did have to lay down a couple times later that afternoon to early evening. Worse thing was his whole body felt irritated. 18Feb2021 (Yesterday), he didn&#39;t have the same feeling. He had a very good morning. Early afternoon started feeling chills and couldn&#39;t get warm. Got into bed with big quilts. Chill sensation lasted two to three hours. Sees that chills are an expected result. 19Feb2021 (Today), so far he has had a good day. He is fatigued now this afternoon. That would be the extent of anything unusual for him. Most concerning was how he was feeling the first day. He doesn&#39;t think he was being a good driver at the time. Probably thinks there should be a recommendation to try and not drive or have a designated driver. Patient would like to know if the anger and aggression was within the range of expected results. Stated he doesn&#39;t know if there was real value in knowing it at this time unless there are booster shots that come out in the next year or so. Stated he wanted to report to Pfizer so it was known there are other things than what was being seen. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 74-year-old male patient re-ceived second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Feb2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 74 years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Asthma, COPD, allergy to sulfa drugs. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.

Con-comitant medications included for-moterol fumarate, mometasone furoate (DULERA), lisinopril, atorvastatin, albuterol and vitamin D. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took historical vaccine on first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL3248) in left arm on 25Jan2021 at 10:00 for COVID-19 immunisation. On 12Feb2021 at 20:00 the patient experienced 101.3 fever, fatigue, weakness and pain at the injection site. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events.

A 74-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection; Lot number: ER8732) via an unspecified route of administration at right shoulder on 27Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.   The patient concomitant medications includes, zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN CR 12.5mg) still ongoing for insomnia, taking it from years as patient comes from family of insomniacs &amp; high-pressure jobs; triazolam (HALCION) (0.25mg) still ongoing for sleep, rivaroxaban (XARELTO) (20mg) started taking in 2012 for pulmonary embolism &amp; has been on blood thinners, aspirin acetylsalicylic acid (low dose aspirin of 65mg) for supplemental blood thinner still ongoing. Patient has history of seasonal allergies and its prime time right now so its compounding. Relevant medical history includes, both knee replacement, pulmonary embolism, bad blood pressure problems maybe 5 years ago all on an unspecified date. The patient historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EN6198), at Right shoulder on 06Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.  On 27Mar2021, When the patient got home from his shot, he had no problems at all and he went to bed. Being an old guy, he got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and he lost his balance and took a nasty fall, so has a bummed up knee and stuff too, so that is what aggravates it. He clarifies he has a bum knee and nose after having the fall. Since he took the fall and has the bum knee, it is kind of a chore going up and down stairs.  On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced general sense of weakness , general tiredness. It has been over a week and he wants to know if that is unusual. Patient adds there was kind of a brain fog thing From: 28 Mar 2021  going on. The brain fog concerns him because he has to get his taxes done. He was still having trouble with the nose bleeds, which sort of compounds his misery, but he is getting better. It seems the side effects are getting incrementally better every day, but its not like he wakes up and its completely gone. It&#39;s like some prolonged illness. His side effects are getting marginally better. He is fairly clear headed today and he even had the nerve to take a short drive to the supermarket and stuff, although he wouldn&#39;t want to drive cross country in terms of being able to concentrate. But doing his taxes, will take a little work. Patient stated in the beginning he had muscle aches and chills from: 28Mar2021, but that went away after a day or two. Patient stated he had muscle aches/chills for a couple of days. He feels he has recovered completely as far as he knows. He never had nausea. On an Unspecified date patient mentions feeling a little short of breath, but states that could be more of the asthma thing. He does not recall having injection site pain at all. The tiredness is definitely ongoing, but has improved. He clarifies it has probably improved incrementally but doesn&#39;t really want to classify it as improvement because it might be temporary. He did not have a headache until he was waiting on the phone to speak to this call handler. On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced muscle pain for a few days and that sort of cleared up. This was the same with joint pain. After the big bang, clarified as the fall, everything proceeded. He still feels the muscle and joint pain, only in his knee, but its starting to fade. His knee was really a beautiful shade of purple, but it seems to be fading and hurting less so that is recovering, too. This pain is secondary. The side effect was the dizziness, stiffness, and inability to keep his balance. Caller states he was stiff as a board and he just couldn&#39;t move fast enough to get one foot in front of the other, and he landed on his knee, so the pain in his knee was not directly caused by shot. He felt fine at the center where he took the shot. He had to wait 15-20 minutes after the shot. He felt fine, drove home, went to bed, and in the middle of the night, it all started. He still feels a little dizzy and unsure and has been using a cane. He got both knees replaced and is worried that he damaged the actual replacement joint as opposed to just the muscle tissue. He just doesn&#39;t trust himself without the cane. He hasn&#39;t fallen over and hasn&#39;t passed out. He feels stiff all over but that could be from not getting to the gym and working out and not doing his regular work outs. Patient stated that the lethargy might be slightly better. He was making himself do more but he still gets really tired and it was really hard for him to get motivated, like to get out of the chair and go downstairs. He went to the supermarket and had to unload his car in stages- he took the perishables out and rested for a while and then went back out and got another couple of bags and then rested again. He just could not work straight through like he normally does. States he is in pretty good shape normally. He does not feel particularly great and that is the reason that he called to find out if this should last this long. Patient stated that he does have high blood pressure and heart problems. In fact at the end of the month, he will be going in for a catherization with Dr. (Name) so that was another reason he wants to have this stuff cleared up and out of the way. He still has dizziness and weakness. Patient stated that last night was the first night of decent sleep he had got. He has insomnia actually and he takes two sleep medications, but even taking those and washing it down with a glass of wine, he could not sleep for a whole week. He clarifies even with the Halcion and Ambien CR, it didn&#39;t work for a whole week- he could not sleep which adds to the brain fog. Typically, he goes to sleep, wakes up after a couple of hours, and then he is awake so he reads for a few hours and then takes the second medication and then sleep the rest of the night. He ends up getting a full 8-9 hours of sleep normally and he did that last night.   On 08Apr2021 he developed a pounding headache but it was probably independent of the shot. He took Tylenol and he is okay now, but he just thought it was ironic that he had one while waiting to talk to Pfizer when he hadn&#39;t had one before. Outcome of the events muscle pain and joint pain, dizziness and stiffness, Feeling unwell were ongoing and those of other events were unspecified.  No further information was provided or obtained

A contactable consumer reported that a 74-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162b2(COMIRNATY, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207, Expiration: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 19Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history includes Arthritis (arthritis is in his right foot only and his big toe, diagnosed in 2017 or 2018) and Concomitant medication were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY) on 26Feb2021 for Covid-19 immunisation and Unspecified steroid shot. Stated reaction was three to four days. First shot got caller and patient down for a week. Second shot got caller down for three days. At first, patient&#39;s reaction was running like hers. Patient had a dry cough on an unspecified date in 2021. Was going for a COVID test today. Last week patient started running a fever on an unspecified date in 2021 and his legs were extremely weak on 14Apr2021. Has to hold onto something to go through the house on 14Apr2021. He was moving a little better, but not much. Patient had to go to doctor for his foot. Has terrible arthritis in the big toe on his right foot. Gets steroid shot every three months. Three weeks and four days after second COVID shot everything seemed to have worn off. The PA put the shot in his foot and it bruised the patient. Patient still has bruises on an unspecified date in 2021. Got the steroid shot in his big toe and two days later the weakness hit a second time. It really wiped him out. Caller cannot help patient get up and down. Patient was struggling with his legs and was aching. Wants to know if a steroid shot on top of the COVID shot and that close after would cause another reaction? The PA said it was ok to get a steroid shot three weeks after. Patient started having these reactions and doesn&#39;t know if it was the COVID shot. Has had steroid shots every 3 months for 4 years. Has never had this kind of reaction. Patient didn&#39;t think about getting the steroid shot because he seemed to be feeling fine. Reaction started the next morning and it was even worse on an unspecified date in 2021. By the third day after the shot he was down and caller couldn&#39;t help patient get up. It scared the caller. Patient also broke out in a rash across his shoulders and down both arms. States her husband has had both shots and he has been having issues since the second one n 19MAR2021. Reporter states 3 weeks and 4 days after the second vaccine, her husband had to have a steroid shot in his foot because he has terrible arthritis in his right foot. Reporter states the patient has had a flare up since then with weakness in his legs and a rash on his chest. States the only difference this time is that he had just had the second Covid vaccine 3 weeks prior. States he has not had steroid reactions in the past, and she feels like this reaction was because of the Covid vaccine. Clarifies the shot in his foot was on 13Apr2021 and she does not know what steroid was injected. States it was 3weeks and 4 days between the steroid injection and the vaccine. States maybe they should war people not to get a steroid shot for a longer time after the vaccine. States after the first vaccine for about 5 days they were just laid out. States they ate soup and whatever they could warm up in the microwave. States his ear doctor said if they reacted to the first shot they must have had Covid at sometimes. States she doesn&#39;t know, they never got tested before but they didn&#39;t have any symptoms. States her husband&#39;s test yesterday was negative. Weakness in the Legs AE: States for the last 2 days, he could not even get up on his own and she can&#39;t lift him because he was bigger than she was. Rash was states it was not itching or anything, just a rash. States it was odd because she has had hives, and this was just broken out. Clarifies the rash was across his upper back, chest, and down both arms on 14Apr2021. States it was kind of like speckled on his body like the measles on an unspecified date in 2021. States the patient was 74 years old and he had measles when he was a kid just like she did, so it is not the measles. States the patient had a Covid 19 test done yesterday and it came back negative, so he doesn&#39;t have Covid. She doesn&#39;t know what it was. Treatment: states he was taking Motrin for the Aching. States she does not know if the reaction was because the PA did the injection, it had always been the doctor that had given the injection. Caller states she thinks it was getting the steroid injection on top of receiving the Covid shot. States the both received their vaccines because they couldn&#39;t get a shot because they weren&#39;t giving shots at her age, so when offered them the vaccine, they jumped on it. Yes, last Monday to his Nurse Practitioner, did not address the weakness in his legs because did not know what to do for that. She did not even say what she thought it was, said he needed to see someone about that but does not know who to see, does not know whether to go to the ER or who to go to. Not that emergent but when doctor does not know what to treat with worrisome. She was calling about to finish the report and to speak with the Medical department regarding if this has been reported before or if any information on the Covid vaccine and steroid injections. He received the 1st dose on 26Feb2021 and the 2nd dose on 19Mar2021. She mentioned that both of them experienced achiness, sore all over after the 1st dose and flu-like symptoms on an unspecified date in 2021 after both doses. Her husband however, had muscle weakness on his legs after the 2nd dose. On 13Apr2021, about 3 weeks and 4 days after the 2nd dose, her husband received a steroid shot on his right foot. They noticed that the weakness on his legs became extreme, to which he had trouble standing up and has to hold on to something to stand up as he cannot support himself. He also had a rash on his trunk, back, and down his arms. She mentioned that the rash was not itchy but was speckled like measles. They were wondering if this has been reported and if it was possibly an interaction between the vaccine and steroid. They mentioned that they already consulted with their HCP but said that they really cannot tell. Outcome of his legs were extremely weak, has to hold onto something to go through the house was not recovered while with other event rash is across his upper back, chest, and down both arms, Achy all over was recovered on 22Mar2021 and flu-like symptoms after both doses and Sore all Over was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021, while with other events was unknown.

Denies any reaction with the first vaccination however 2 days later he developed body wide hives starting on his back initially and spreading diffusely across his entire body.  He also endorsed some mild fatigue but otherwise had no symptoms from a second vaccination.  Denies any fever or chills.  States he has hives spreading out to his forehead and his nose.  He has been taking Benadryl and using hydrocortisone cream.  States hydrocortisone cream does not help.  Benadryl seems to help some but states he has been struggling to sleep due to the itching.  He does note some itching between the webs of one of his hands as well which is new as of today.  Denies recent travel or staying in a hotel/building other than his house.  No changes in laundry detergents, body washes, lotions, or soaps.  Notes he otherwise feels well.

This 74-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 08Apr2021 at 8:00 AM in left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was blood pressure abnormal. No family medical history relevant to events. Concomitant medications included blood pressure medication. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 10Mar2021 at 12:00PM in left arm as single dose for COVID-19 immunization at the age of 73-year. No other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient received second dose of the covid vaccine on Thursday, 08Apr2021, had body aches on 08Apr2021. It is hard for him to personally know exact dates. Patient had different aches and pains anyways. Especially in the arm that he received the covid vaccine in because he pulled a muscle in that arm. He had issues with that arm before, so it was hard for him to tell. He did notice his arthritis seemed to be more intense on 08Apr2021. He did not have a fever. He was now back to his normal aches and pains. He did not have any medications, medical history or testing to add that he felt was relevant. He was a typical old guy with aches and pains and that sort of thing. This report was assessed as non-serious. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right upper arm on 04Mar2021 at 11:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6199) as the 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at the military facility. He previously received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number: EN9581) on 11Feb2021 at 2-3 pm (at the age of 74 years old) in the right upper arm and experienced a bout of diarrhea, but he took loperamide (IMODIUM) and it went away; he expected the first shot and last only about a day. Relevant medical history included ongoing legally blind, wherein his central vision was screwed up and this was something going on before the shots and with his peripheral vision, there were areas he could see clearly, and also had eye pain; his hearing was hypersensitive on certain frequencies, which was ongoing; and residual neuropathy in feet; all from an unknown date prior the vaccine. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient previously took clonazepam (KLONOPIN) from an unspecified date in 2009; further reported that the patient had no information on this medication other than it was Klonopin that caused him to stop breathing and put in coma in 2009 and that he was given intravenous (IV) antibiotics, because he had 3 major infections and this was when the issue with his vision started. The patient previously received and stopped getting the flu shot years prior reporting when he got sick for 6 weeks. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) other than the first dose. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). The patient reported that he got the second shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and within 5 minutes, he had a severe reaction. He was in an observation area at the facility and less than 5 minutes after getting the shot, he had problems breathing on 04Mar2021, it was painful to breath; however, it was further reported that &#34;painful&#34; was not the word for the problems breathing. The triage team gave him shots and he went to the emergency room (ER) and ended up spending the night in the hospital. It was further reported that they gave him an epinephrine (EpiPen) and some other shot in the left arm and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) in the right arm and put on oxygen on him. He was admitted to the hospital and released the next day. He was given the option to leave the next day and so he did. The doctor explained, they were concerned it was cardiac related, but did blood work and told them he was fine on an unspecified date in 2021. The doctor also told him they saw a rash on the left ankle on 04Mar2021 and therefore knew it was an allergic reaction. The rash on ankle was barely visible the next day, it had resolved though, but was not sure of the exact date. He couldn&#39;t have seen it anyway. There had also been other issues since then. He remarked that he moved things, but couldn&#39;t remember where he moved them on an unspecified date in 2021. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened. Regarding the patient&#39;s hearing, he explained that while in church, they were playing music and it was pure pain. He went to the clinic and saw an otolaryngologist, who told him that his hearing was hypersensitive on certain frequencies, not all though. He stated he had this before, but never with music at the church or like this. He was in the car and a car beside him with heavy base playing was giving him issues; the same kind of the pain, but on the opposite end with base. This was something new and not like he had before. It was ongoing and he had not gone back to church, so as not to experience this again. This started within a week or 2 after the second shot. Since the shots on an unspecified date in Mar2021, his vision was compromised. There were upper and lower areas, &#34;sweet spots,&#34; he could see. With his last check up, the vision in the lower section had shrunk even more; where he could see from about the 3:30 to 8:30 area before, currently it was from 5:00 to 7:00. He explained this was like on a clock. Also he was able to see the big E at the top of a vision chart, but in Mar2021 after the second shot, he noticed within days, he could no longer see the large E. He had a regularly schedule appointment a couple weeks after the second shot and this was noticed. It had gotten worse. Additionally, he would stand in front of the eye chart and as part of the eye exam, they would hold out fingers to see if he could see them. Last year at 6 feet (ft), he could see them, but currently, he couldn&#39;t see them until 2 ft away. If he was in bright light, he had severe eye pain, to the point of crying. He had to leave and get out of that situation, it was so bad. Even going outside with a hat and sunglass without looking at bright light, it still impacted him. The lighting in his bathroom bothered him; he had to have the blinds closed and was home bound. His closet was the only way to get relief. This was all new since the Covid shot. On an unspecified date in 2021, the residual neuropathy in feet was reported as worsened. He had this previously, but currently had hypersensitive in his feet in those areas. The patient found some essential oils that help so he could get to sleep and keep it from itching in his feet. The patient was deducting that for whatever reason, it was impacting nerve areas that had issues previously. It was causing them to get worse. He could only find this commonality; the optic, auditory, and residual neuropathy, the shot was aggravating these things that he already had problems with previously. It was added that he had also noticed his eyes had a throbbing pain, like a feeling of wanting to explode. He has had this in the past, but not too often and currently, it was daily and it was getting worse. It started about 3 weeks after, but it didn&#39;t happen often at first. Currently, it was almost daily. The doctor told him that there was not a way this could happen, there was no evidence this could happen. There had been no treatment, nothing had been done. He said with his DNA, if something could go wrong even just 1% then it would happen to him. The AE &#34;problems breathing&#34; did require an ER visit. The patient was hospitalized for the event problems breathing from 04Mar2021 to 05Mar2021. The patient underwent further lab tests and procedures, which included hearing test with unknown results on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of problems breathing, allergic reaction, and rash on the left ankle. The patient recovered from the event &#34;problems breathing&#34; on 04Mar2021; he recovered from the events &#34;allergic reaction and rash on the left ankle&#34; on an unspecified date in 2021; he was not recovered from the events &#34;residual neuropathy in feet was reported as worsened, hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened, and his vision since the shots was compromised/vision in the lower section had shrunk even more/gotten worse,&#34; while the outcome of the other event was unknown.

                                                Little red spot here and there; He woke up with itching all over; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Heart disease, Diabetes, Atrial fibrillation (AFib), Gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), shellfish allergy, heart surgery, quadruple bypass, allergic reactions and hives. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for AFib, clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) as blood thinner, metformin hydrochloride (METFORMIN ER) for Diabetes, Atorvastatin, Metoprolol Succinate (ER), pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PROTONIX) for GERD, and Losartan potassium to protect kidneys from diabetes. The patient had an anaphylactic shock reaction in past and requires an epi pen for the past 30 years but was unsure what he was allergic to. During his allergic reactions, he usually has hives but with this reaction he has no hives, no difficulty. The patient got the Pfizer vaccine (COVID-19 Vaccine) on 21Jan2021, last Thursday. He had no symptoms, no problems that evening. The next night at 1 in the morning he woke up with itching all over. He took some Benadryl and did not go away. Took a little more Benadryl, finally he was up about 2 hours with this itching and then he went to bed and slept quite a while because he had taken Benadryl. The next day he seemed okay, during the day. Then again during the night at 1 &#39;O clock or so he then woke up again with itching all overtook Benadryl again. So, that was on Saturday night. So, Friday night, Saturday night and then Sunday he had the same thing again. The doctor stated that it has been 3 days of itching, so he put him on Medrol Dosepak which the patient got today, so he has just started that. Previously, 30 years ago, he had anaphylactic shock and they were never able to figure out exactly ran all kind of tests, never found out what exactly was he had the allergic reaction to. He had in the past but not quite a few years now. He would kind of just break out in hives and that. But during this time he really did not get hives, he got today 25Jan2021 a little red spot here and there, that he would be itching. He has no red spots or anything by the site of the injection but there is concern that now he has got to take a Medrol Dosepak (treatment) and kind of hopefully not wake up again tonight with this itching. So, the concern is the next shot. The patient&#39;s weight was &#34;199, 200 pounds&#34; (Reporter was not sure). The outcome of the events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 75-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 09:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cholesterol (blood cholesterol abnormal) and blood pressure blood pressure abnormal). Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure, atorvastatin for cholesterol, fish oil and vitamins NOS (MULTIVITAMIN). The patient reported that he got the first dose of the covid vaccine on Friday (22Jan2021) and he had symptoms following the injection which included redness and swelling at the injection site that moved down his arm. The patient also mentioned that he experienced like a bump, it was typical like what it says in the brochure, as time went on, it got red, in a spot by injection site, then it traveled. The patient mentioned that he was seen at his PCP and reports that he was told he had an allergic reaction to the shot, hopefully it would not spread any further, and states his doctor seemed to be very concerned his physician prescribed him with an epi pen to have for if he gets the second dose of the vaccine and the reporter stated that he has never diagnosed with allergies. The patient inquired if the injection wasn&#39;t put in correctly and it was put in the tissue and not the muscle. The reporter mentioned that his wife said the needle didn&#39;t go in as much as when she got her injection, so he was wondering if it was administered in the right way and also asking if part of the needle could have broken off and if that is what is causing the redness and swelling to his arm. His doctor assured him the needle could not break and stated that his said that it did not look like the injection was as deep as hers since she was watching him get his vaccine. The reporter also inquired if that could have caused an issue if it was not administered deep enough. He mentioned that he waited several hours before checking infection site [pending clarification] and noticing the swelling and redness. States it is also itchy and painful, not a painful to the touch but an itchy, knifey kind of pain, states sometimes it feels like he needs to rub it and sometimes it feels like someone is stabbing him. The outcome of the event allergic reaction was unknown while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 75 years, on 21Jan2021 10:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient said he had red hives develop on Saturday, 23Jan2021. He went to an Urgent Care for treatment. He said the doctor at the Urgent Care looked at his hives, and told him the hives were likely related to the COVID-19 Vaccine, but the doctor was not positive of that. The patient said he hadn&#39;t had any recent changes in his health, or issues before he received the COVID-19 Vaccine, so that was why the doctor thought the hives were from the COVID-19 Vaccine. He clarified he has hives from his knee to his chest, and from his chest to his arm and to his neck area. He clarified the hives have been moving around his body. He said the hives had little red bumps, saying the hives were itchy. Therapeutic measures (Zyrtec and Hydrocortisone Cream) were taken as a result of hives from his knee to his chest, and from his chest to his arm and to his neck area, hives had little red bumps and were itchy (urticaria). The outcome of the event was recovering.

This is now accompanied by an area of numbness in the same area. The pain symptoms are aggravated by extension of the arm. These symptoms have persisted for the past week or so. I don?t know if they will be permanent.  I believe this was caused by injection into a peripheral nerve by injecting too distally into the deltoid.  My suggestion is to review proper injection techniques (e.g. location) to all who are giving injections.

                                                On March 15 I started experiencing pain in both hips as I was walking.  This pain continued and a few days later I started to experience pain in my lower back in addition to the pain in my hips.  It was very hard to walk and if I went too far or long I had to stop and wait for the pain to lessen.  The pain had lessened but is still present.  on about March 20/21 I noticed a blister on the index finger of my right hand.  A rash showed up on my left arm in the area of my wrist on March 23.  It is now March 25 and the rash all over my whole body.  It itches and at times is painful.

                                                Approximately 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I developed a full body rash, some hives and itching.  It covered arms, legs and torso with the worst discomfort in the groin area.  (Wife described area affected as a map of the lymph system.)  Rash continued for three days at which time I contacted my doctor who told me during a video office visit it would probably go away in a few days and it did without treatment of any kind.

I had the same thing happen the following early morning 3/19. Then I experienced the same reactions while working out at the gym during the morning and or if not at the gym on a morning fast paced walk. I also had a rash near the site of the injection for three and a half weeks. I have been having this reaction for four weeks. On reporting this to my PCP he advised me to go to the ER and have myself checked out as it sounded like angina pain to him. I did this on 4/2/2021. No problem found.

                                                Got Herpes zoster without complications, ( Shingles ) right after 1st Phizer Shot. I thought it was an insect bite visited the Doctor on March 29th. He did not equate the shingles with the shot. It wasn&#39;t until i read an artical about linking the Phizer shot with shingles in 6 younger patiants.

I went to Urgent Care they gave me hydroxyzine 25 mg, I took it for 2 days, I had to stop taking it because it made me too tired.
