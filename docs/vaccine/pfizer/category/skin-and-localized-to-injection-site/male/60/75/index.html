                                                Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt a heat flash, people setting in the area asked if I was OK as my face was red. It cleared in approximately a minute. The 2nd heat flash came on about 5 to 10 minutes later and cleared about a minute later. The 3rd heat flash came on about another 5 to 10 minutes, again clearing at about 1 minute. Next I felt like my head was in a fog, found it very hard to focus, and was forgetting what I was doing. I walked over to the office, my supervisor asked if I was ok as she said it looked like my eyes were glazed over, my head was still in a fog. This cleared by 2:30 p.m.

                                                hives; anxious; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional. A 61-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) intramuscular at the right leg on 25Jan2021 (lot number EN5318 and expiry date unknown) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a nursing home/senior living facility. Medical history included COVID prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. On 25Jan2021, the patient experienced hives and was anxious, the patient was taken to the hospital. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The events caused hospitalization on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events hives and anxious was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the urticaria and anxiety. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded.

A 62-year-old male patient received NT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL01-40), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Dec2020 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Is it really COVID infection or is it due to side effects as from what he read the reaction shouldn&#39;t really last long. It may last probably 3-4 days but this has gone beyond that so he was little concerned and the fever that he had was 7 days after the vaccine.&#34; The patient still had chills and body ache which he means they were not going away and now mild fever. When probed for the outcome of, Physician stated, &#34;They are persistent you know some day he had one day which was good but after that in the afternoon in the evening he felt the same thing.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 63-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) oral from 2019 (reported as 2 years ago as of 06Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 30 mg capsule once as needed for acid reflux, oxycodone oral from 2020 (reported as 3-4 months ago as of 06Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 10mg tablet once by mouth as needed for chronic pain from two back surgeries that did not go well, omeprazole oral from 2020 (reported as about a year ago as of 06Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 20 mg capsule once by mouth as needed for acid reflux. Medical history included ongoing low white blood cells has had for a couple of years, and two back surgeries. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Flu shots. The patient took his first dose of the COVID Vaccine last Thursday (31Dec2020) and about 10 minutes after he started itching. That day he had previously taken a PPI medication for acid reflux, Dexilant, and some pain medication, Oxycodone. Since then he has been trying to rule out what is going on and what gave him the itching. Now, every time he takes his PPI medication, either Dexilant, or Omeprazole, he itches. This did not happen prior to getting the vaccine. He asks, how long does the COVID Vaccine stay in the system for? He is supposed to get the second dose in 3 weeks, but he does not want the same results. He was asking if it is normal for his to experiencing itching and how long will it occur. He has to take his medications. He does not want issues with his esophagus, but he also does not want to itch. The itching right after he got the vaccine lasted about a day or so and dissipated by Friday. Saturday he did not have it. Then he took a Dexilant that day, on Saturday, for acid reflux, and he itched until the Dexilant was out of his system. Then yesterday, he tried an Omeprazole and he had the same results. He can not even wear a pajama top or anything on his arms cause it makes him itch. He has irritation on his arms on Jan2021. He also has low white blood cells, which he had prior to getting the vaccine. He started Dexilant originally about 2 years ago. He takes it only when he needs it. Has taken it about 3-4 times prior to getting the COVID Vaccine. He started Omeprazole about a year ago. Only takes this as needed, PRN, even thought the doctor said he should not take it as needed. He does not like to take medicine so he tries not to take things. He has taken flu shots in the past, he gets one every year, and has never had an issue with that. He wants to get the second dose of the vaccine, he just does not want to itch. The action taken in response to the event for dexlansoprazole, oxycodone, omeprazole was unknown. Event outcome of itching was recovered on Jan2020, while for other event(s) was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

He experienced cough in Dec2020. No visit to physician office was required. On the 06Jan2021 he went to the emergency room but that was because he was concerned about rash he developed. He thought it was due to the Tylenol he was taking. Relevant tests performed in Ja2021 included: blood work and chest X-ray did when he went in for the rash and they were was fine. He was treated with steroid injection for the rash. The rash cleared up in the next couple days. As of 12Jan2021 the only thing he has cough but he coughs anyway. He still had a cough but it was not atypical for him to have a cough. He was scheduled to receive his second dose on 13Jan2021. He no longer had any Covid symptoms and wanted to know if he could still get the second dose as scheduled. The outcome of event tested positive for the virus and not recovered was unknown, of coughs was not recovered. A Product Complaint was filed.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose on the left arm for vaccination. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism. Concomitant medication include levothyroxine (manufacturer unknown) from an unspecified date probably 2-3 years ago and ongoing for hypothyroidism. The patient reported that the first dose was administered of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 04Jan2021. He had onset of soreness in left arm that day, 14Jan2021 which he recovered completely from by 05Jan2021. He stated that starting maybe 05Jan2021 or 06Jan2021, he had onset of feeling kind of achy and like he was wanting to run a fever. Starting 08Jan2021, he started running a very high fever in excess of 102 degrees Fahrenheit which has been ongoing and persistent since then. He has been taking Tylenol every 6 hours to try to control the high fever but the high fever is just not going away. He was wondering if there is anything he can do because his primary care physician (PCP) can&#39;t really help him at the clinic; He was wondering if Pfizer is familiar with this reaction and if there are any recommendations regarding them. He has taken Tylenol to help, but it is not making it go away. He wanted to know if steroids could be used to counteract this side effect. He added that he is supposed to get the second dose 25Jan2021 but he does not plan to get the second dose, at this point he does not want to do that. He was administered the vaccine because his mother lives in an assisted living facility where the vaccine was offered to residents; and because he acts as a sitter at the facility it was offered to him. On 11Jan2021 he went to Urgent Care for these events, and was given a Rapid COVID-19 Test which had negative result. The outcome of the event soreness in left arm was recovered on 05Jan2021, the outcome of the event was wanting to run a fever/very high fever in excess of 102 degrees fahrenheit was not recovered and the outcome of the event feeling kind of achy was unknown.

The patient experienced leg pain and bruising which started immediately day after second COVID shot on 14Jan2021.

This is the first of two reports. A 64-year-old male patient receive first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), at same age intramuscular in arm left on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee, a knot on the left side of his head, bleeding from above his left eyebrow, had a left black eye, all on Nov2020, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cataract surgery, using crutches when he walks, in the hospital from Nov2020 to 17Nov2020, pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital on Nov2020, he couldn&#39;t walk on 19Nov2020, 6 stents, 3 cardiac stents on Oct2020, and chicken pox as a young adult. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded. The other events are considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the use of BNT162B2.

It was like red dots that become sensitive and look slightly blistered. Shoulder pain: this was nothing compared to the pain of the rash and blisters (24Jan2021). He had taken off the bandage and was sore. He was not even sure if he was still sore or not because he was only paying attention to everything else. It was overwhelming. Treatment: He called his doctors and they said that he should use Calamine lotion as a temporary soother for itch and rashes. They also told him to take Benadryl and his doctor prescribed Prednisone. Outcome of the event shoulder pain was unknown while the other events was not recovered.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Pt is s/p liver transplant in May 2012 on chronic immunosuppression medication. He received first dose of Covid vaccine on 1/29/2021. On routine labs on 2/5/2021, LFTs were significantly elevated from baseline -  ALT 123 (27), AST 66 (21), Alkaline Phosphate 242 (127), Total bilirubin 2.8 (0.3), Direct bilirubin 1.9 (&lt;0.2). He did report new full body itching the day before. As a result of elevated labs, the patient presented to the emergency room due to concerns for biliary obstruction versus graft rejection. Repeat liver function tests were still elevated, although slightly better. Abdominal US was normal, no signs of dilatation or obstruction with patent vasculature. Pt was admitted to the inpatient transplant unit overnight and labs repeated on 2/6 showed continued improvement. With this, pt was continued on the same immunosuppressive med regimen and discharged home with close outpatient transplant follow-up.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

                                                On 02/12/2021 around 11:00am I was assigned to have Covid 19 shot at the table#6. At that time I saw the Vaccine was already in the syringe which was in the plastic bag with zipper. Ten days after the shot I felt well, no pain nor swell on my left shoulder. But in the morning of 02/23/2021 after waking up I started to feel hurt to my left arm and the pain was transmitted to the left of my back (left lung). During these 3 days 23,24,25 my pain reached the maximum intensity 10/10 even I took 3 times a day Ibuprofen which was each time 2x200mg. On 02/26/2021 I went to Hospital in the Emergency Unit and after diagnosis the Doctors found that I had 3 heart arteries clog-up. How can I be sure that the liquid in the syringe is the Pfizer Vaccine or something else? I used to see the TVs broadcast on the Covid 19 shot that the nurse inserts the syringe in the small Pzifer bottle, suck the Vaccine into syringe and inject  the vaccine into the shoulder of the patient. Can CDC require that all Covid 19 providers show the vaccine to all patients before the shot? In 2017 I had an Angiogram and my 3 bypasses were not clogged why they are all clogged now? I don&#39;t change my every day diet and I&#39;m very careful with eating fat, cholesterol and salt in my everyday food.

Approximately 2 weeks post-injection, I developed coryzal symptoms of nasal stuffiness and congestion without fever, chills, headache, or myalgias. On, or about, 3/3/21, I noticed diminution of hearing in the left ear without signs of drainage, fever, or dizziness. This was treated with a Z Pac, nasal and oral decongestants, and nasal steroids. Over the course of 10 days, the hearing decline had improved, but a clinical exam and testing by an ENT on 3/12/21 confirmed evidence suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, with asymmetric impairment in the affected (left) ear.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

He them experienced some mild tingling in his ears, face and lips.  ? 10:30 he got home and his lips were mildly swollen, more so on the upper lip, not as much on the lower lip.  ? 10:45 he took an Allegra and about 30-40 minutes afterwards the lip swelling started to calm  ? 5:45pm I spoke with him. He said he has no more symptoms. A little tired perhaps from the day or the Allegra (though it doesn?t cause too much drowsiness compared to Benadryl) ? He also reported he had a flu and shingles vaccine back in early November so it has been more than a month.

I took some Benedril which helped with swelling. that was the most severe after effect. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the vaccine because i had not been anywhere that weekend and had not  put my hands on anything unusual that i don&#39;t normally touch. It only happened to my hands. Other than that i had minor flu like symtoms from the shot,  achiness and slight fatigue feeling. I had an ER doctor look at my hands when i went in today to get help for my bronchitis, which i had some before the covid shot. It got worse on Monday. He perscribed prednisone which has pretty much taken the hand spots away..i was tested negative for covid today(1/19/21) by the way.

A 68-years-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EK5730) in Left arm, intramuscular on 06Jan2021 around 11:00 at SINGLE DOSE to prevent COVID, famotidine, oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 40 mg, 2x/day for gastritis .  Medical history included gastritis, ongoing diabetes (diagnosed 3 years ago), ongoing hyperparathyroidism (diagnosed many, many years ago), ongoing sjogren&#39;s syndrome (diagnosed recently this year), gout from 2010 and ongoing , coronary atherosclerosis from Nov2020 and ongoing, ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (diagnosed many years ago), asthma from 2020 and ongoing , sleep apnoea from 2019 and ongoing, crohn&#39;s disease from 1981 and ongoing, and abdominal pain. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID] (reported he takes aspirin everyday and the aspirin causes him to have some abdominal pain).   The patient was administered with the first dose of the vaccine on 06Jan2021 and after that he developed a rash in the face that was itchy symmetric and bilateral on 08Jan2021. The rash was bilateral and symmetrical. The event was reported serious due to medically significant. Upon transfer, the caller clarifies he did not take steroids for the rash. A few days prior to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, he started taking a new oral medication. So, he doesn&#39;t know if the rash is from the new medication or the vaccine, but he decided to call and report this event just in case. He clarifies the name of the new medication was famotidine. Today (12Jan2021) was the first day it was much better. Caller confirmed he did not take any steroids, the only medication he took was an antihistamine for the management of the symptoms. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported rash in the face that was itchy symmetric and bilateral occurred two days after the first dose of COVID 19 Vaccine, BNT162B2.

A 68-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 15:30 at single dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included back disorder and is waiting for back surgery, high blood pressure, and very likely diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon, didn&#39;t notice anything until Saturday. On Saturday afternoon (23Jan2021) he had a couple severe/serious episodes of shortness of breath. He has no other symptoms. It was better on Sunday and is better today but he still feels uncomfortable on Jan2021. He bought a oximeter today and while at rest he is at 94 but when he gets up to do anything it goes to 80. He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

                                                when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain; feel a little tightness in his breathing/ tightness/shortness of breath; on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%; feel a little bit of heat on his forehead; nose dripping/nose was running; seems like it isn&#39;t working; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                None of my health care providers have been able to explain the cause of my sudden loss of vision in my left eye at approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb 2021.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist&#39;s answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.  Prior to approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb, my vision was as it had been for several years prior with little if any degradation.  I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference &#34;physical&#34; with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.  Upon leaving the ER at approx. 10:30 a.m. on 8 Feb my &#34;end of visit vitals&#34; were recorded as blood pressure 110/63, BMI 20.92, weight 150 lbs., height 5&#39;11&#34;, temperature 97.6 F, pulse 67, respiration 16, and oxygen saturation 95%.  Late last year I had my usual flu vaccination without any side effects.  After almost 2 weeks, I do still have a bruise at the Pfizer vaccine injection site on my left arm and I experienced mild muscle soreness the evening after my vaccination and the following morning.  Normally I have no adverse reaction to vaccinations.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber. The patient&#39;s second dose was on 19Feb2021. The outcome of the events stomach cramps, felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t was recovered on 30Jan2021, not a lot of energy/little lack of energy, not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine/whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine was recovering, while unknown for the rest of the events.

                                                noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all; he felt fullness in his right ear; sore left arm where he got injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EM9809, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 12:30 (at 71-year-old) at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (mild hypertension and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-6 years ago), hyperlipidemia (mild hyperlipidemia and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-10 years ago). He stated in Aug, he tested positive for antibodies through Lab and was still positive a month later. He wondered how that might effect the decision of if he should get the second dose, if he is potentially immune. He had no symptoms but tested negative with PCR test. His girlfriend who he lives with tested negative for antibodies. Height was reported as 6 feet to 6 feet one inch tall. Weight was reported as 176-178lbs, he thought he may have gained a few pounds. There were no concomitant medications. The caller had the first dose of the vaccine 10Feb2021 12:30. 5 days later he felt fullness in his right ear (Feb2021) and noticed diminished hearing in the right ear (Feb2021), maybe 20-30% less. He was comparing how much he could hear the ticking of his watch in his left and right ear and couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all. He went to an ENT and they found that it was reduced in the right ear secondary to a nerve problem and wasn&#39;t secondary to anything else. The doctor read online on an ENT site, a couple of people had acute bouts of decreased hearing. They were treated with steroids and resolved. His provider prescribed him with a high dose of steroids, 70 mg. He was going to take it after dinner but all of the sudden he could hear the ticking better. He held off on taking the steroid and the next morning his hearing was fine. He went back and they retested and it was back to normal. He had taken Naprosyn and is not sure if that played a part in improving things. It resolved not even 24 hours after the initial symptoms. It resolved on its own. He asked, is this a side effect that has been reported? Are there any cases of this happening in one ear rather than 2? Could it be a contraindication getting the second dose? His doctor is researching it and he is supposed to call early next week about this. He asked how many people were in the clinical trials that the side effect data is based on. The caller stated he heard someone report that he doesn&#39;t believe that people getting the vaccine necessarily need both doses of the vaccine. They are finding after a week after the first dose they have relative immunity and might not need the second dose. The caller asked how effective this vaccine might be on new variants, how effective just one dose of the vaccine is, if Pfizer is looking into mixing the vaccines- whether it will be something that can be interchanged with other Covid-19 vaccines, asked where he could find updates on medical information about  this in the future. The caller stated he wanted to thank Pfizer for developing the vaccine as quickly as they did. Retired psychiatrist calling about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who says he got his first dose on 10Feb in (State name), and had a sore left arm where he got the injection (Feb2021) then 5 days later had fullness in his right ear with his hearing diminished. He says he called his otolaryngologist because he had had a hearing test a few months ago, and was tested again now and there was a moderate decrease of hearing in his right ear. He says he would like to know if this could be a possible side effect, since he has read of reports and his otolaryngologist knew of two reports where people did report hearing loss. He says that he was treated acutely with steroids at high dose of 70mg for which he filled the script, then called his internist who was ambivalent with him taking a high dose. Caller says then within a few hours, his hearing was better, and by the next morning it was normal, and he went back to the ENT and his hearing was the same as it was a few months ago. He says he did not take the steroid he was prescribed, the Prednisone, he took Naproxen, and since it may have been a nerve problem with hearing diminished related to auditory nerve, it seemed to get better in a number of hours. He says he has reported this already to VAERS. Caller says his right ear is better now, it got better within a a few hours after he saw his doctor, then it was completely better by the next morning. He says that after they tested his hearing due to the fullness in his ear and hearing being diminished it got  better on its own. He says on the next hearing test his hearing was exactly back to normal. He says he did take Naproxen once or twice during that time period, 20 or less hour period, more like 12 hours, one 220mg tablet each time, he doesn&#39;t know whether that contributed to helping. Naproxen (EXP Jan2022, LOT: ODRO445). He says that the reason he is calling is to see whether Pfizer has had similar reports. He says that he saw on a website that 12 people were reporting deafness or blindness, but it seemed to be an (name), so he took it with a grain of salt. He says he would like to know whether people have been reporting with issues for hearing, unilaterally or bilaterally, or what results have been with some people. Caller says unfortunately the website he mentioned was obviously anti vaccine and claimed to be with the (name) or version of the CDC and said that they were reporting they had 12 people reporting deafness and blindness from COVID vaccine and made it sound like the most dangerous vaccine in the world, but it was a conspiracy website that claimed it was with the equivalent of CDC. Caller does not have website addresses to provide or details about reports on that site.  Caller says he looked at the (name) and it said nothing about this kind of possible side effect. He says he doesn&#39;t know if his could be related to getting the vaccine, or if he should still get a second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all&#34; and &#34;he felt fullness in his right ear&#34; was recovered in Feb2021, while for other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported unilateral  deafness was unlikely related to bnt162b2.  This was  an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I did have my first shingles shot on November 18th, 2020 at the clinic here. I think it is a single pox and thought I would bring it to your attention. I have had the shingles before so I know what they look like and feel like. Since there is only one, I don&#39;t plan on going to my dermatologist to confirm that it is a pox plus I am not sure if the Covid shot is a side effect that caused the pox or not. It is not painful although itching and not responding much to antiseptic cream. I plan to go for my second Covid shot on January 26 and I am looking forward to it. I don&#39;t go for my second Shingles shot until February 17. There is a possibility that it could be something else besides a pox but wanted to bring it to your attention just in case. Thanks.

A contactable consumer reported that a 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Batch/lot number: ELO142, via an unspecified route of administration from 13Jan2021 11:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included haemochromatosis diagnosed in the mid 90&#39;s and wa reported as hereditary it was too much iron in the blood, he goes once a month for therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce the iron in the blood; very rare bacterial infection called Arupense from an unknown; he has a slight case of asthma but mentioned that it was related to living on the coast with the mold and moisture and also has a little wheezing. Concomitant medications included ethambutol, montelukast, pravastatin, amlodipine; hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN (E.C.) and rifampin for infection and blood pressure medications.  Patient had the first dose of the vaccine yesterday 13Jan2021. He has no discomfort, but at the site where the shot was administered, he has some red streaks running from the site up to his neck and shoulder. It was very small. It looks like if he took a ball point pin and drew some lines. However, the patient&#39;s wife said it was bigger than a ball point pen. It was jagged lines. The one at the injection site itself, the injection site swelling was about the size of a dime, a red area. He only discovered the red streaks about an hour ago on 14Jan2021, so there has not been no radical change. Patient has concerns; he wanted to know if he should seek medical advice. &#34;Is it just a rash?&#34;, he asked. His doctor doesn&#39;t know about this yet.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on the lot/batch number has been obtained.

Medical history included type 2 diabetes (he uses insulin for this), bladder cancer (he was a former bladder cancer patient). Concomitant medication included insulin for Type 2 diabetes. Patient had the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. A week later, he had developed a rash and it turned into shingles. It is currently clearing up and he is taking medications for it. He is due for his second shot of the vaccine on 05Feb2021 and was wondering if there are any recommendations for him not to take it. It was clarified that on 22Jan2021 a rash developed on his face which was found to be shingles. He saw a personal doctor, the doctor even put him on medication. All has gone well, once he started taking the medication the shingles didn&#39;t progress and dried up and is now in the late stage of drying up. He asked if he should be reporting this, he also would like to know if he should get the second covid vaccine. The Rash started on 22Jan2021 and was on the face, hair scalp region. He specified further that the rash was located in the upper right quadrant on his face, also being on the eye lid and hairline. He added that he actually had a second doctor check this as well, because the rash was on the eyelid. His Primary Care doctor had him see a ophthalmologist. Patient clarified that he first thought it was a rash, and after he went to the Dr., she confirmed that what he had was actually the shingles. Outcome described as still with a little bit of redness, but it is healing and it is dried up. Dr prescribed him Valtrex for the shingles. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included that he has had no positive covid tests. In Dec2020, he had the regular covid test and that was negative. In early Jan2021, he had the regular covid test as well as a covid-19 antibody test, and both were negative. Patient mentioned serology test, he then confirmed that he used the word serology inadvertently, and meant antibody. He has had no issues with vaccines in the past. The outcome of the event was recovering.

I DID NOT REALIZE THAT TIREDNESS, MUSCLE PAIN, JOINT PAIN AND FEELING UNWELL ALONG WITH DIZZINESS AND WEAKNESS  WERE SYMPTOMS OF A POSSIBLE REACTION TO THE VACCINE. SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS COULD BE FROM A PREVIOUS STROKE.

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL3249, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at 16:30 at a single dose on the left deltoid (reported as &#39;left shoulder&#39;) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks before the COVID-19 vaccine. It was reported that the patient initially had no problem after receiving his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine, but on 23Jan2021 (also reported as 2-1/2 days later), he woke up in the middle of the night, at approximately 3:00am, and the whole back and side of his right leg was covered with very large, itchy welts from his right buttocks down to his right ankle. The patient also had some small itchy areas on the front of his right leg, but no other parts of his body. She said she gave her husband Benadryl 50mg, and put some hydrocortisone cream on his welts, and that seemed to take care of the welts. The reporter told her brother about the welts her husband (patient) developed after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said her brother was questioning if maybe her husband had a delayed reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her brother said her husband&#39;s welts may have been caused by spiked proteins developing from the COVID-19 Vaccine administration. The reporter asked if it is safe for the patient to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, which he is scheduled to receive on 10Feb2021. The patient took 2 Welby generic Benadryl 25mg capsules (lot number: 9DR0738, expiry date: Dec2020) when he first discovered the large, itchy welts on the back and side of his right leg. Then the patient took another 2 Welby generic Benadryl 25mg capsules before he went to bed later that day.  The reporter topically applied the product &#34;After Bite&#34; to the patient&#39;s itchy welts. The reporter clarified that After Bite (lot number: 32812) is not hydrocortisone cream, like she thought, but a Sodium Bicarbonate and Aloe Vera product. The reporter added that the patient&#39;s very large, itchy welts are very faded on the back and side of his right leg, but there remains a couple small spots. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

The consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot no. E10142, via an unspecified route of administration (administered to the left arm) on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for Covid vaccination administered at facility. Medical history included 100% disabled, Covid from Jul2020, hospitalized from 21Jul2020 to 26Jul2020, blood plasma, and sore. No relevant family medical history relevant to AEs. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient previously took remdesivir. The patient called to report side effects after getting the first Pfizer COVID vaccination. He got it on 19Jan2021. He had COVID before. Last summer he hadn&#39;t left the house for 20 plus weeks and their son who was living with them brought the COVID virus in to them. His son and wife were asymptomatic and suffered at the house and he was completely disabled, with underlying conditions had to drag himself to the facility. He eventually had to be hospitalized on 21Jul2020. He had blood plasma and remdesivir and stayed in the hospital from Tuesday through Sunday. After getting the treatment, he felt like superman. On 20Jan2021, he next day, about 24 hours later he started feeling sick again, he felt like when he had COVID back in Jul2020. It lasted for 24 hours, terrible headache, chills, aches, and a little diarrhea. He said after he got the vaccine, 24 hours later, his arm got sorer and sorer. He had 99.9 F fever and a terrible headache. He also put on a little weight on an unspecified date. No emergency room visit. No relevant tests. He called the facility the next morning and they told him to rest. He slept all day and the next day he felt like superman again. He called the facility that Thursday morning and they instructed him to relax and that it seemed to affect people who have had the COVID virus before, they have that reaction, and it should subside and it did. He stated his side effects were about 20% of what they were when he actually had COVID. The clinic told him that if he had any reaction to call and that Thursday he just relaxed. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. Never had any problems with shots, not really. He remembered when he went to specific area they gave him a whole bunch of shots with these guns and he was just sore a couple days, but that was it, no big deal. The patient underwent lab test which included COVID-19 positive Jul2020. The outcome of feeling sick, headache, chills, ache, diarrhea was recovering while outcome of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021107344 Same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

By 3:00 p.m. That day he had soreness at the injection site and by 10:00 p.m. he noticed difficulty using his arms to the transfer.  There was particular difficulty with the proximal left upper extremity and bracing himself and he fell to the floor.  He feels that both arms are weaker since the injection.  He had some pain in the arms particularly at the injection site initially but that has resolved.  He had dry mouth up until February 2nd.  By February 2nd he could start to transfer a bit better from a chair to his driver seat in the van.  He is still not back to his baseline function.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 75 years, on 21Jan2021 10:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient said he had red hives develop on Saturday, 23Jan2021. He went to an Urgent Care for treatment. He said the doctor at the Urgent Care looked at his hives, and told him the hives were likely related to the COVID-19 Vaccine, but the doctor was not positive of that. The patient said he hadn&#39;t had any recent changes in his health, or issues before he received the COVID-19 Vaccine, so that was why the doctor thought the hives were from the COVID-19 Vaccine. He clarified he has hives from his knee to his chest, and from his chest to his arm and to his neck area. He clarified the hives have been moving around his body. He said the hives had little red bumps, saying the hives were itchy. Therapeutic measures (Zyrtec and Hydrocortisone Cream) were taken as a result of hives from his knee to his chest, and from his chest to his arm and to his neck area, hives had little red bumps and were itchy (urticaria). The outcome of the event was recovering.

This is now accompanied by an area of numbness in the same area. The pain symptoms are aggravated by extension of the arm. These symptoms have persisted for the past week or so. I don?t know if they will be permanent.  I believe this was caused by injection into a peripheral nerve by injecting too distally into the deltoid.  My suggestion is to review proper injection techniques (e.g. location) to all who are giving injections.
