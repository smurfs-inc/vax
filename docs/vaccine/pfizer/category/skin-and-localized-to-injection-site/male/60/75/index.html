It cleared in approximately a minute. The 2nd heat flash came on about 5 to 10 minutes later and cleared about a minute later. The 3rd heat flash came on about another 5 to 10 minutes, again clearing at about 1 minute. Next I felt like my head was in a fog, found it very hard to focus, and was forgetting what I was doing. I walked over to the office, my supervisor asked if I was ok as she said it looked like my eyes were glazed over, my head was still in a fog. This cleared by 2:30 p.m.

                                                Pt received the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine on Sunday 1/17/21 and developed a sore arm, but otherwise had no symptoms. By Tuesday 1/19/21, he was having shooting pains through his shoulder and down to his elbow. By late Wednesday, he had started to develop hives on his palm, between his fingers, and up to the elbow. Pt states he has a history of a pinched nerve in his neck and elbow, but this pain is nothing like his usual pain.  On 1/22, pt presented to the ED for left uper arm pain and rash. He denied new detergents, foods, clothes, wooded area exposure. Denied decreased ROM in shoulder, but ROM makes his shoulder sore. BP 161/82, otherwise vitals normal. Rash did not apear infectious. No evidence for DVT. Pt received ketorolac 30 mg IM x 1 in ED and was prescribed hydrocodone-APAP 5-325 mg tabs PO Q6h PRN #8. Pt was instructed to follow up with PCP in 1-2 days.  By 1/25/21, pt reports the hives have become dark purple, like bruises. He states he has trouble making a fist and is not using his left arm at all - when this writer spoke to him, he said it was &#34;gimpy.&#34; Pt stated during the phone call that he was about to call his PCP for a follow up appointment.

Patient went to to see a doctor on 2/17 and the doctor prescribed hydroxyzine and a cream to help with the hives, which helped lessen the symptoms but was unable to rule out that the reaction was caused by the vaccine. The doctor recommended that the patient still receives the 2nd dose of the vaccine.

                                                Mild symtoms. About 25 minutes after receiving injection felt slight inflammation on both cheeks near the nose, also notice splotchiness on cheeks. In addition felt slight itch on inside of both elbows which presented a couple hive-like bumps not previously there.  These symptoms continued for about 15 minutes and then began disappearing by the time I reached home. After 45 minutes all adverse reactions were no longer present. No adverse reactions occurred following this except for a sore left arm at injection site.  Arm soreness was abating by 9pm on same date and pretty much gone by next morning.  No additional medication was taken for for any of the reactions. A cool compress was used on the left arm.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at the hospital. The patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) on 22Dec2020. Relevant medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes; both were diagnosed in 2006 and ongoing conditions and were under control. Concomitant medications included metformin, lisinopril for high blood pressure, and semaglutide (OZEMPIC, injection), which was a once a week injection kind of like &#34;Trulicity&#34; that encourages his body to make more insulin. The patient said that when he got the second dose of the vaccine on 12Jan2021, he got an achy arm and it went away. At the time of the report on 18Jan2021, almost a week later, he felt like he got the vaccine in his arm again and it was going into his shoulder. The patient was asking if it was normal. He was driving at the time of the call. The patient had been a scrub technician (tech) and an endoscopy tech for 20 years. During the first surge, when they shut down the outpatient surgeries, he went and worked as an aide in the COVID ward. He was glad to get the shot. He did what his kids would do when they were young and would get a shot. He took ibuprofen. Later that evening for the achy arm, he took more ibuprofen. The achy arm lasted only a day. He thought he wasn&#39;t going to have any side effects at all. It felt like a flu shot. The patient clarified that at the time of the report (18Jan2021), his arm felt achy like it was the day he got the shot and the day after. He got the vaccine as he was in the first bunch in the city and he works in healthcare and the fact that he was over 60 years old. The patient stated he could live through it and he was just curious. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The events did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. The patient had no relevant tests. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of achy arm, which included ibuprofen. The patient recovered from the event &#34;achy arm&#34; on 13Jan2021, while the outcome of the event &#34;felt like he got the vaccine in his arm again and it was going into his shoulder/ arm felt achy like it was the day he got the shot and the day after&#34; was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded.

It may last probably 3-4 days but this has gone beyond that so he was little concerned and the fever that he had was 7 days after the vaccine.&#34; The patient still had chills and body ache which he means they were not going away and now mild fever. When probed for the outcome of, Physician stated, &#34;They are persistent you know some day he had one day which was good but after that in the afternoon in the evening he felt the same thing. Fortunately, he was off for four days it didn&#39;t really have much problem, physically it was persistent has not gone away.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, had mild body ache, felt a little sick, cough, fever, mild sore throat. The outcome of events chills, mild body ache was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                Have a cut in my leg which is very unusual; Saw a big cut in my feet; I was bleeding from somewhere; It was quite a lot of blood drawing out of my body; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 62-year-old male patient started to receive single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization; and adalimumab (HUMIRA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose (injection every other month) for arthritis. Medical history included arthritis, blood pressure (abnormal), and blood cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol, olmesartan medoxomil, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL XL), and vitamins: ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride. Patient stated, &#34;The reason I am calling, I have just a concern that something happened to me. I did not pay much attention but now I have read the news one doctor died after getting this COVID Vaccine (Further details were not available over the call) I have a small incident happened to me the day after I received my first dose of the COVID Vaccine. I just wanted to get some information. You know what happened the next day night, in the evening I was taking a shower and all of sudden I was bleeding from somewhere. Lot of blood was coming out while I was toweling my body out. I couldn&#39;t find out where the blood is coming from. I checked, it&#39;s not from my urine, not from my rectum but it was quite a lot of blood drawing out of my body. Immediately, I called my wife into bathroom, then I squeezed my body then the bleeding stops. It was on 24Dec2020. You know my kids were at home. I don&#39;t want them to find it. The bleeding stopped and everything went away. Then I thought maybe it is something related to my GI. I went to my GI doctor yesterday to have a checkup, they don&#39;t know anything either but I am due for my second dose for next week Wednesday. Now I had this news about thrombocytopenia on this doctor died (Clarification unknown). So I am just afraid if there is anything related this. Do you have any explanation on how I bleed and where it bleed? It was lot of bleeding even my towel was full of blood.&#34; Patient wanted to see if anybody else had similar experience or if he get the second dose and he get the complication again. Patient was a medical technologist. He was doing ultrasounds. He was working in a pediatric hospital. Patient was not prescribed/recommended vaccination. &#34;Nobody recommended it. During my hospital. I am healthcare professional. So everybody in my hospital. I just went there and get it. I didn&#39;t ask my doctor.&#34; Patient added, &#34;You know everything I read about this case and then you know, I have a cut in my leg which is very unusual. I have never seen that. I don&#39;t know how it happened. You know all of sudden oneday I wake up and I saw a big cut in my feet also. So, I am just afraid (onset date not reported).&#34; The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

                                                I got the pfizer covid vaccine on 1/18/21 my initial reactions were slight soreness at injection site and a mild headache for 2 days. I took some ibuprofen for the headache.  Prior to the vaccination I have not been ill. When I woke up on Sunday morning , 6 days after my initial injection I have a swollen gland on the left side of my neck about 2 &#34; directly below my ear lobe. The swollen gland is mildly sore. Initially i think the size was about 1.75&#34; by 3/4 &#34;.  Now on day 4 after it first presented itself the swelling is slowly going down to about 1&#34;x  1/2 &#34;.

                                                Blood pressure was high; tired from the night before; Itchy; slight headache; little lightheaded; Heart racing; panic attack; Hot flashes; Sweating; Chills; achy/body aches; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. A contactable consumer reported for himself, a 62-year-old male patient who received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as by injection) to left arm on 14Jan2021 at 3pm at single dose to prevent COVID/COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. Concomitant medications included antidepressants. The patient received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine last 14Jan2021 at 3pm, and everything went well. When he left the place, he had a slight headache. He had to stay there for 15-20 minutes to make sure he had no reaction. He just got a little lightheaded, he didn&#39;t think much, and it didn&#39;t get worse. The patient took 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL) and forgot about it. It went away for a while. He took the shot at 3 pm and he took paracetamol at 4 pm. Later that night, about 10 pm, everything kicked in. He was sick again at 10:30 pm, or so, the headache was gone for several hours. He was ok between 4 pm and 10 pm. Then about 10 to 10:30 pm, when he went to go to sleep, his heart started racing, like he was having a panic attack, then he started getting hot flashes, sweating, chills, and aching, and this went all night from like 10 pm to 11 to the next morning. He had a doctor&#39;s appointment to get his knee examined for an upcoming knee surgery. The patient clarified that he didn&#39;t go to the doctor because of the symptoms, he went for his knee. He asked the doctor, before getting examined, and the doctor said he got off easy, as the doctor himself was sick for 3 days. The patient asked the doctor if he could take something to calm down, as his blood pressure was high on 15Jan2021 at 8 am. They had taken his blood pressure to examine his knee, and the doctor said it was alright. He was prescribed with alprazolam (XANAX), and the doctor said it would be fine. The next day, he was tired from the night before. He had no symptoms the next day. After he took alprazolam, he slept fine, he felt better. The hot flashes, heart racing, body aches, and chills were gone, and he read everything as far as symptoms. The heart racing went away about 11 the next morning because he took alprazolam. The patient stated that he forgot to add one more, he had all the symptoms described as side effects, but he also had itching. He had very mild itching and was given cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC, lot number: OHE2723, expiry date: Feb2022, UPC: 4122053077), it was like 80% gone. Every now and again he has a little itch, but it was bothering him all night that first night. Currently, the patient felt pretty good. He has no symptoms other than the slight itch. He further stated that his second dose is on 04Feb2021. Out of all symptoms, the thing that freaked him out the most was the heart racing, he asked if he could take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) before the shot. He has been on antidepressants for a while, he has a lot of anxiety, but the day he went in, he felt good, and didn&#39;t take alprazolam. He also asked if this have triggered all that heart racing stuff. He was seeking for information if there was anything to do to prepare him better, he knew you have to sit there for 15-20 minutes to see if there was a reaction. The outcome of the event headache and lightheadedness was recovered on 14Jan2021, unknown for blood pressure high and tiredness, recovering for itchy, and recovered on 15Jan2021 at 11 am for all other events.

                                                One week following second dose, I experienced a urticarial reaction to a meal. I have never had allergies prior to this type of reaction. Upon allergy testing after this event on 2/19/21, an allergy to shrimp was noted. This report is intended to document a brand new food allergy that occurred one week after receiving second dose of COVID vaccine. Treated with one tablet of Benadryl and reaction subsided thereafter.

In the morning (about 7:30) I noticed a rash all over his trunk (small pink spots) As the result of the falls, he hit chin and cut it. Hit left temple and bruised it. Back is very sore and painful. May have cracked rib(s). Currently 2:20 pm on March 14. He is no longer experiencing the dizziness. The rash seems to be clearing up (brownish spots instead of pink spots on trunk). He&#39;s resting.

A 63-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) oral from 2019 (reported as 2 years ago as of 06Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 30 mg capsule once as needed for acid reflux, oxycodone oral from 2020 (reported as 3-4 months ago as of 06Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 10mg tablet once by mouth as needed for chronic pain from two back surgeries that did not go well, omeprazole oral from 2020 (reported as about a year ago as of 06Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 20 mg capsule once by mouth as needed for acid reflux. Medical history included ongoing low white blood cells has had for a couple of years, and two back surgeries. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Flu shots. The patient took his first dose of the COVID Vaccine last Thursday (31Dec2020) and about 10 minutes after he started itching. That day he had previously taken a PPI medication for acid reflux, Dexilant, and some pain medication, Oxycodone. Since then he has been trying to rule out what is going on and what gave him the itching. Now, every time he takes his PPI medication, either Dexilant, or Omeprazole, he itches. This did not happen prior to getting the vaccine. He asks, how long does the COVID Vaccine stay in the system for? He is supposed to get the second dose in 3 weeks, but he does not want the same results. He was asking if it is normal for his to experiencing itching and how long will it occur. He has to take his medications. He does not want issues with his esophagus, but he also does not want to itch. The itching right after he got the vaccine lasted about a day or so and dissipated by Friday. Saturday he did not have it. Then he took a Dexilant that day, on Saturday, for acid reflux, and he itched until the Dexilant was out of his system. Then yesterday, he tried an Omeprazole and he had the same results. He can not even wear a pajama top or anything on his arms cause it makes him itch. He has irritation on his arms on Jan2021. He also has low white blood cells, which he had prior to getting the vaccine. He started Dexilant originally about 2 years ago. He takes it only when he needs it. Has taken it about 3-4 times prior to getting the COVID Vaccine. He started Omeprazole about a year ago. Only takes this as needed, PRN, even thought the doctor said he should not take it as needed. He does not like to take medicine so he tries not to take things. He has taken flu shots in the past, he gets one every year, and has never had an issue with that. He wants to get the second dose of the vaccine, he just does not want to itch. The action taken in response to the event for dexlansoprazole, oxycodone, omeprazole was unknown. Event outcome of itching was recovered on Jan2020, while for other event(s) was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 63-year-old male patient received the 1st does of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose left upper arm on 23Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history included ongoing hypertension that began maybe 10 years before and still ongoing, controlled with medication. No family medical history relevant to the events. The concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL). History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the suspect. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. He has not had reactions to any other vaccines. On 30Dec2020 he tested positive for Covid. His symptoms of covid started 27Dec2020 in the evening sometime probably around 7pm. He experienced cough in Dec2020. No visit to physician office was required. On the 06Jan2021 he went to the emergency room but that was because he was concerned about rash he developed. He thought it was due to the Tylenol he was taking. Relevant tests performed in Ja2021 included: blood work and chest X-ray did when he went in for the rash and they were was fine. He was treated with steroid injection for the rash. The rash cleared up in the next couple days. As of 12Jan2021 the only thing he has cough but he coughs anyway. He still had a cough but it was not atypical for him to have a cough. He was scheduled to receive his second dose on 13Jan2021. He no longer had any Covid symptoms and wanted to know if he could still get the second dose as scheduled. The outcome of event tested positive for the virus and not recovered was unknown, of coughs was not recovered. A Product Complaint was filed.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                soreness in left arm; feeling kind of achy; was wanting to run a fever/Very high fever in excess of 102 degrees Fahrenheit; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose on the left arm for vaccination. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism. Concomitant medication include levothyroxine (manufacturer unknown) from an unspecified date probably 2-3 years ago and ongoing for hypothyroidism. The patient reported that the first dose was administered of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 04Jan2021. He had onset of soreness in left arm that day, 14Jan2021 which he recovered completely from by 05Jan2021. He stated that starting maybe 05Jan2021 or 06Jan2021, he had onset of feeling kind of achy and like he was wanting to run a fever. Starting 08Jan2021, he started running a very high fever in excess of 102 degrees Fahrenheit which has been ongoing and persistent since then. He has been taking Tylenol every 6 hours to try to control the high fever but the high fever is just not going away. He was wondering if there is anything he can do because his primary care physician (PCP) can&#39;t really help him at the clinic; He was wondering if Pfizer is familiar with this reaction and if there are any recommendations regarding them. He has taken Tylenol to help, but it is not making it go away. He wanted to know if steroids could be used to counteract this side effect. He added that he is supposed to get the second dose 25Jan2021 but he does not plan to get the second dose, at this point he does not want to do that. He was administered the vaccine because his mother lives in an assisted living facility where the vaccine was offered to residents; and because he acts as a sitter at the facility it was offered to him. On 11Jan2021 he went to Urgent Care for these events, and was given a Rapid COVID-19 Test which had negative result. The outcome of the event soreness in left arm was recovered on 05Jan2021, the outcome of the event was wanting to run a fever/very high fever in excess of 102 degrees fahrenheit was not recovered and the outcome of the event feeling kind of achy was unknown.

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: Not Reported), via an unspecified route of administration on Arm Right on 18Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included spinal injury, an infection in his scrotum, some neurogenic things, white blood cells (his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine). There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that, the consumer stated, &#34;my wife and me went to hospital and we got a COVID vaccine first one, we had some, my wife had terrible side effects, I am crippled, and I had not it before in Mar2021, she is ok, but she is just sick, I am sick, but she is very sick and she got bad stuffs (rash).&#34; Caller states that both him and his wife were having some side effects, although his wife was having the worse trouble. Caller states that last night, him and his wife were up all night. Caller was up because his wife was up so sick. Caller states that both him and his wife are sick and disabled, that is why they got the shot. Caller reports that he is retired and disabled because he got hurt at work. Caller states that what he is experiencing, is he just feels bad on 18Mar2021. Caller states that he did previously go to a doctor to do a blood study, the doctor is looking for blood diseases or cancer in the caller, and caller thinks that taking the COVID shot just exposed his weak spots. Caller reports that both him and his wife have body aches. Caller was wondering if there was anything, he can go get over the counter at the pharmacy to help. Caller reports that he cannot call his doctor, because they are all out on Fridays. Caller states that him and his wife are not planning to take the second dose of the product. Caller states that they have a lot of hurricanes where they live. Their house got tore up in one, and they sold it to one of their sons, and the caller and his wife moved out to their beach house for a while. He had an infection in his scrotum, something stung him, and that is what the doctors are looking for in him now, because his white blood cell count is high, and he has a rash on his scrotum in Mar2021. It was infected. Caller states that this infection in his scrotum has flared back up since getting the COVID vaccine yesterday, so caller had thought it went away but he guesses it never went away. Caller confirms that the issues with his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine, but the caller thinks that the vaccine was exposing the caller&#39;s weak spots, and maybe that is a god send because it is all flared up now, and the caller will be able to tell his doctor that. Caller states that he has been getting high white blood cell count readings since the stuff with his scrotum first started, and that is why his doctor sent him to an Oncologist for all this blood testing, so maybe this will be a b lessing in disguise for the caller, in finding out what is wrong with him. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

This is the first of two reports. A 64-year-old male patient receive first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), at same age intramuscular in arm left on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee, a knot on the left side of his head, bleeding from above his left eyebrow, had a left black eye, all on Nov2020, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cataract surgery, using crutches when he walks, in the hospital from Nov2020 to 17Nov2020, pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital on Nov2020, he couldn&#39;t walk on 19Nov2020, 6 stents, 3 cardiac stents on Oct2020, and chicken pox as a young adult. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded. The other events are considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the use of BNT162B2.

He had shoulder pain and it was hurting the day after he got the vaccine on Friday 22Jan2021. Rash started on Sunday 24Jan2021, it was like a chicken pox type rash. It was like red dots that become sensitive and look slightly blistered. Shoulder pain: this was nothing compared to the pain of the rash and blisters (24Jan2021). He had taken off the bandage and was sore. He was not even sure if he was still sore or not because he was only paying attention to everything else. It was overwhelming. Treatment: He called his doctors and they said that he should use Calamine lotion as a temporary soother for itch and rashes. They also told him to take Benadryl and his doctor prescribed Prednisone. Outcome of the event shoulder pain was unknown while the other events was not recovered.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

It was causing me some pain when the tip of my backpack touched the area. On Tuesday the 16th I visited the doctor who gave me the news that I had shingles. He discovered that it was actually spreading a little bit more around the original that I saw on Sunday. I&#39;m already on medication for that.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Pt is s/p liver transplant in May 2012 on chronic immunosuppression medication. He received first dose of Covid vaccine on 1/29/2021. On routine labs on 2/5/2021, LFTs were significantly elevated from baseline -  ALT 123 (27), AST 66 (21), Alkaline Phosphate 242 (127), Total bilirubin 2.8 (0.3), Direct bilirubin 1.9 (&lt;0.2). He did report new full body itching the day before. As a result of elevated labs, the patient presented to the emergency room due to concerns for biliary obstruction versus graft rejection. Repeat liver function tests were still elevated, although slightly better. Abdominal US was normal, no signs of dilatation or obstruction with patent vasculature. Pt was admitted to the inpatient transplant unit overnight and labs repeated on 2/6 showed continued improvement. With this, pt was continued on the same immunosuppressive med regimen and discharged home with close outpatient transplant follow-up.

A 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history included Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday 14Jan2021. He felt great after receiving the injection, then got a cough and fever. On 18Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he was around someone who was positive for COVID-19. On Friday 22Jan2021 he reported having chills, no fever, body aches and a slightly productive cough. On Sunday 24Jan2021 he checked his temperature and it was 99.5 F. He he took two tylenol and he had not had a fever since that time. Between Friday 22Jan2021 and today (25Jan2021) he had multiple (4) COVID-19 tests that all returned negative. He went to the doctor yesterday morning (24Jan2021) and started on steroids and an antibiotic. He was also reporting that his face was red this morning (25Jan2021) when he woke up. He wanted to know if he continued to be negative for COVID and these were side effects from the vaccine can he still received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by someone that if take a &#39;Regeneron Infusion for COVID&#39; then he would have to wait 90 days to receive the next dose of vaccine, he asked was that true? He wanted to know if it&#39;s possible to have side effects a week after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He asked &#34;Let&#39;s say I end up testing positive for COVID, do I still get the second dose of the vaccine? Let&#39;s say I do have COVID-19 that means I would have antibodies from that and then I would have antibodies from the first dose of the vaccine so would that mean that I&#39;m covered and protected from COVID then?&#34; He had taken a few Covid tests and all come back negative. Caller was wondering if this was just his body reacting to the vaccine. On 18Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he came into contact with someone with Covid and on 22Jan2021 he took the Covid test. He said that he had chills that night 22Jan2021 and the next day 23Jan2021. He was told by the doctor to get the PCR test. He took the test in the morning and it tested negative 23Jan2021. That night he had someone came by his house and he took the test at 18:00 and took the test again at 20:00 at his doctors office. He said that all of the tests were negative. He said that he was testing so much so he could take the cocktail. The doctor prescribed Doxycycline Hyclate to take twice a day and prescribed Dexamethasone 6mg. He stated that his symptoms chills on Friday and Saturday and he had the start of a cough. He said that he had little aches on Saturday, but they were gone later that day. On Sunday morning (24Jan2021), he was prescribed these 2 things and by 11:00 had a fever of 99.5. The cough was not bad, and he had no aches. He took 2 Tylenol. He said that he took his temperature from 16:00 24Jan2021 Sunday until now, and he had no fever anymore. He would feel a little something in his cough, but it was getting better he said probably because of the medications. He stated that he got tested for strep, but had not received the results. He said that today his face got very red and it was red for about 1.5 hours, but was fine now.  He said that he wanted to know, Does the vaccine have some of the antibodies working at this moment? Due for his second dose 04Feb2021, if keeps testing Negative and the symptoms didn&#39;t come back does he still get the vaccine on 04Feb2021? If he does have Covid and has no symptoms does he take his vaccine on 04Feb021? If he tests positive and takes the Regeneron cocktail, does he have to postpone the the 2nd dose for 90 days? The outcome of events was unknown.  information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Slight soreness in left arm around and just below the point of injection.  This went away around 6PM on Tuesday, the day after the injection.  For about 2 hours around 10PM until I went to sleep on Monday night (the night of the injection), I had a slight fever but it was only slight.  I had a more intense fever (though for only 30 minutes) the evening that I had my flu shot last October when I visited my doctor for a check up, so I would definitely categorize the fever from the COVID-19 shot as very slight.  It was gone when I woke up in the morning.  After I woke up, I was a bit nauseous, but it was so slight (and I have not been nauseous for well over a year) that it took me awhile to actually recognize it as being nauseous.  This lasted for 15-20 minutes and then it disappeared.  On Wednesday morning, my heart went into an irregular heartbeat that felt different than what I feel when it goes into an irregular heartbeat.  I have no idea if there is any relation between receiving the vaccine and getting an irregular heartbeat but I thought I should report it.  I have recovered from all symptoms from the vaccination except the irregular heartbeat.  I put down as &#34;unknown&#34; if I have recovered  from the adverse events as I don&#39;t know if going into an irregular heartbeat was in any way related to the vaccination.

                                                Patient woke up at 10:00PM, out of a sound sleep, having an acute asthma attack and generalized itching.  No rash.   Used Albuterol inhaler twice, 5 minutes apart, and took Prednisone 20 mg orally.  Within 60-90 minutes, symptoms completely resolved and did not reoccur.  He did not seek medical attention at the time of this reaction, but called this office on 3/11/2021 so that the reaction could be documented.  That prompted today&#39;s office visit and the completion of this VAERS form.  Patient does have monthly allergy injections, but last injection was on 2/23/2021.

                                                This could be purely a coincidence, but 18 days ( on 03/07/2012) after my first injection on 02/17/2021 I started having some pain, burning and tingling under and around my right arm. Note the first injection was in the left arm. I saw my doctor 2 days later for a normally scheduled appointment. He said he thought I had aggravated a nerve  and that i should get a Shingles vaccine as soon as I could after I finished the Covid Vaccine. I received the second dose on 03/11/2012 and then the day on 03/12/2021 i began breaking out with Shingles.  Again this is probably purely a coincidence but I thought I should report it just in case.

No fever, and vitals were OK. 800 mg Ibuprofen and Norco did not ease the pain. It was unbearable. Was tested for Covid and Strep, and both came back negative. I called my Primary Care physician and the local ER. All they said to do was to hydrate. Went to urgent cacre...no help. Lingering fatigue for another week. Finally after two weeks, the symptoms subsided. Second Dose. Same kind of pain on second day, but seems to be subsiding...so far. But, my injection site is very sore, swollen, and red. Does not seem to be getting better 5 days out.

                                                A couple of days after the vaccine, back muscle (upper back, left side- the same arm of vaccination) started hurting. Since then, the pain is constantly there BUT it moves to various locations, only on the left side, sometimes in muscles, sometimes in shoulder joint and often at the site of vaccination. The pain, while it moves around, is only at one location, often in addition to the vaccination site. Thus it can be in left shoulder joint and the site. Or it could be the site and at the shoulder- neck joint. Never has the pain migrated to the right side and is confined to the left arm, shoulder, upper back area. Naturally the pain dulls upon taking a couple of Tylenol?s or Advil?s but otherwise has been there no -stop for about two weeks, shortly after the  vaccination. Avery slight swelling can be felt at the injection site.

                                                Starting 4 days  after second shot, I developed extensive rashes on multiple areas of my body.  The rashes appear to be controlled by Benadryl.  Also started taking Prednisone on 3/22/2021 at 12:30  PM.  At this point (1:00 PM) I have taken 5 doses of Prednisone 10 mg each.  The rashes subside within 2 hours of taking 2 tablets of Benadryl, but reappear around 5 hours of taking Benadryl.  Rashes typically on same body parts, but in different areas.  Rashes still present today.

Ear and Face were swollen, warm to touch, painful and could not hear.  I am still having difficulty hearing in that ear (3-25-2021), sounds like liquid in that ear.  I called a tele doc service on Sunday, 02/14/2021, they prescribed Amoxicillin -Clav.  Temperature and swelling went away, still having difficulty hearing in that ear.

                                                On about April 28 give or take a day, I noticed a small red soar like an irritated ugly mean sore not open but threatening like. I got the vaccine in the right arm but these are all in the left lower middle arm. Then two more. This went on for a week and then I started to put rubbing alcohol and in the last 3 days I put Antiseptic Iodine solution 10% Now today I have about four more, total about 7 or 8. They are redish and appear to have flesh raw like around the middle. They are about 1/16 to 1/8 inch in size. It is scary and they dont go away and nothing seems to help get rid of them.  I dont know if I should get the 2nd vaccine as is to be done this friday.

I developed a rash at the injection side, left arm. The rash was 2in x 3in and was very itchy. I talked to my HCP  and he looked at my rash. He stated it looked like Lyme disease and he placed me on Docycycline medication as a precautionary. He also took pictures of my rash for documentation.

                                                After the first dose I had no side effects but after the second dose I had various reactions: - about thirty minutes after the shot I developed a strange sensation on the left temporal area of my head extending to behind my eye. This went away after a few hours but when it started I thought of Bell&#39;s Palsy.  - Later my arm got extremely sore at the site of the injection it still hurts and in a large area of the arm 5 days later - Painful area below the left armpit and in an area about 3 inches in diameter (area of the lymph node). Still have pain although less after 4 days.

The evening of 2/15, my platelet condition worsened starting with profuse bleeding of gums following a waterpik session and subsequent identification of petechia on legs and blisters on month and tongue.

                                                According to staff....Recipient received the above vaccination and went to sit for 30 minutes.  He had already explained to the staff that he had had previous reactions to bee stings that required epinephrine so the nurse practitioner had  instructed him that he was to wait for 30 minutes vs the usual 15 minutes.  It is unclear exactly how many minutes into the post-vaccination period passed before he began to report numbness around his lips.  The nurse practitioner then indicated he began a &#34;rash&#34; on the back of his neck.  The recipient reported that this was feeling very much like his previous allergic reactions.  They took his BP and it was reported to be around 180/100 at that time.   He did not report feeling SOB but reported his throat felt like it had in previous allergic reactions.  Recipient remained alert and oriented the entire time.  It was decided by the two nurse practitioners on site that he be given the epinephrine and Benadryl IM.  His BP remained elevated and then, following the epinephrine, he became very shaky and a bit foggy. 911 was then notified for further assistance from the EMT&#39;s and possible evaluation at the local hospital which was about 5 minutes away.  Paramedics evaluated the recipient and agreed that evaluation at the hospital would be warranted.  He never lost consciousness or required oxygen or other assistance. He was able to place himself on the gurney and was speaking with his wife (that was present)as he was taken out the door.  The transfer was done out of an abundance of caution. We do not know if the hospital kept him following the incident.

                                                The patient noted that blood and a &#34;clear liquid&#34; was running down his arm.  He stated that it was 1/16th to 3/32nds inch wide and ran to the level of the elbow. (This occurred while the vaccinator was looking away and disposing of the syringe in the sharps container.)  It was wiped up and pressure was applied to the site without further problem.  Upon reaching home he thought about this and then wondered if he had received a complete dose. He then contacted the health department and I contacted him in follow up. In discussing this with the vaccinee and the vaccinator, NP, her immediate impression was that this was blood only but admits that perhaps a portion of vaccine could have been mixed in as well.  This was discussed with the vaccinee and I feel that greater than half of the vaccine was s\administered so no repeat dose will be given. He will return for his 2nd dose in 21-42 days.

Went to the ER to get treated. I was medicated with different antihistamines. And I was observed for five hours. The swelling of the glands didn?t go down some what. But I am still itchy not as drastic as it was yesterday Monday, March 1 of 2021. But my body is still itchy. Medication?s are Benadryl, famotidine,  and prednisone. I will be seeing my family doctor this afternoon as a follow up from yesterday because I am still itchy most around my body.  No fever, no bodyaches, but the itching Has not some subsided.

                                                On 02/12/2021 around 11:00am I was assigned to have Covid 19 shot at the table#6. At that time I saw the Vaccine was already in the syringe which was in the plastic bag with zipper. Ten days after the shot I felt well, no pain nor swell on my left shoulder. But in the morning of 02/23/2021 after waking up I started to feel hurt to my left arm and the pain was transmitted to the left of my back (left lung). During these 3 days 23,24,25 my pain reached the maximum intensity 10/10 even I took 3 times a day Ibuprofen which was each time 2x200mg. On 02/26/2021 I went to Hospital in the Emergency Unit and after diagnosis the Doctors found that I had 3 heart arteries clog-up. How can I be sure that the liquid in the syringe is the Pfizer Vaccine or something else? I used to see the TVs broadcast on the Covid 19 shot that the nurse inserts the syringe in the small Pzifer bottle, suck the Vaccine into syringe and inject  the vaccine into the shoulder of the patient. Can CDC require that all Covid 19 providers show the vaccine to all patients before the shot? In 2017 I had an Angiogram and my 3 bypasses were not clogged why they are all clogged now? I don&#39;t change my every day diet and I&#39;m very careful with eating fat, cholesterol and salt in my everyday food.

                                                I received the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination on the morning of 2/17/21 with no resulting initial sequelae other than injection site tenderness. Approximately 2 weeks post-injection, I developed coryzal symptoms of nasal stuffiness and congestion without fever, chills, headache, or myalgias. On, or about, 3/3/21, I noticed diminution of hearing in the left ear without signs of drainage, fever, or dizziness. This was treated with a Z Pac, nasal and oral decongestants, and nasal steroids. Over the course of 10 days, the hearing decline had improved, but a clinical exam and testing by an ENT on 3/12/21 confirmed evidence suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, with asymmetric impairment in the affected (left) ear.

                                                3 Days post 2nd vaccination, widespread urticarial rash over entire body (neck, trunk, arms, legs). Rash did NOT go to face nor mucous membranes (pictures available). Large itchy welts that responded to diphenhydramine 125mg - 175mg (25mg - 50mg per dose) PO per day, which gradually tapered over two (2) weeks. On day 3, took 12mg dexamethasone PO on advice of ER physician. Both diphenhydramine and dexamethasone resolved rash but interesting to note that when diphenhydramine wore off, itchiness, then welts, returned. Learned to take diphenhydramine at first sign of itchiness. Have never experienced such an allergic reaction before, and this was the first time taking diphenhydramine and dexamethasone for such a condition for me. Also, discontinued prescription medications about one week into rash just in case. Restarted medications a few days before complete remission with no adverse consequences (so current medications as a cause were ruled out). Also, took famotidine 40mg PO during last week that also seemed to help a little  but this may have been due to slow resolution of adverse reaction.

This consumer reported events for two doses. This is the first of two doses.  A 66-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), intramuscular, administered in the left arm, on 16Jan2021 at a single dose (at the age of 66-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medication. The patient had &#34;no problem&#34; with his first COVID-19 shot.  A week after his first COVID-19 vaccine dose, he had itching around his waist. He thought he may have had a spider bite, because he had been working around an area that had hatched black widow spider eggs. While he was at an appointment with his urologist, his urologist said the spot on his waist looked like shingles. He had 1 spot on his waist. The spot was a circle that turned black, and had a lot of dark spots, like bruises around the black circle. He was putting on cream on the spot on his waist and has gone away slowly. His blood work was &#34;OK, and there was nothing negative&#34;. The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021194671 Same patient, same drug with different vaccine dose, different AE

Also I noted that the 2nd covid-19 dose recorded on the15th of March is identical to the one I received  on February 22, 2021, leading me to believe that the person who administrated the second shot simply copied the lot number information from the first shot that was recorded on card.

Instead of using the muscle  of the upper arm , she injected me almost at the top my shoulder, hitting bone.  The injection site was more than two inches above the 1st injection, when I had zero side effects.  Side effects for the second injection were 1) extreme soreness at injection site 2) bruising 3) extreme headache and 4) chills.  All symptoms have diminished, though not entirely, as I fill out this form (March 25th, 2021 04:00 p.m.)

I assumed it was just temporary and didn&#39;t mention it.  But it has continued off and on since the time of my 2nd vaccination almost 2 weeks ago.  I feel it for a few seconds to perhaps a minute or so, then it&#39;s gone for a while.  This repeats multiple times throughout the day.   I have had no other side effects from the vaccination, no temperature of flu-like symptoms.

At various times after I would become aware I was home, alone, on couch, unable even sit up. On one occasion I determined it was 1437hrs, Tuesday, 08 Feb 2021, and sent two text messages with great difficulty just saying HELP. IT was actually 0237hrs, Monday, 08 Feb 2021. Both HELP messages had been replied with questions about what the problem was. At 1200hrs, Tuesday, 09 Feb 2021 I became lucid again though at first I believed it to be Wednesday, 10 Feb 2021.

Hx of severe recurrent acute sinusitis until the age of 40. Being sheltered in place since Apr 2020.  Beginning Jan 2021 I started experiencing a little yellowish nasal discharge with slight nasal congestion and occasional pressure in the maxillary sinuses. On Jan 21 received the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Because of no improvement with symptomatic treatment of sinusitis, on Feb 3 started Augmentin 500 mg 3 times a day. On Feb 7, symptoms became much worse: fever 38.2C (100.7F), chills, muscle aches but the most troubling symptom was severe (level 8) face pain. Bouts of pain lasted for a few seconds but repeated about every 30 sec. It felt like an electric shock originated in the nasopharynx and extending to the maxillary sinuses. Pain affected both sides of the face but mostly the right side. Additional symptoms: scalp tenderness, neck pain and light stiffness while moving, skin hyperesthesia. On Feb 8, underwent PCR COVID-19 testing, which was negative.  On Feb 12, canceled the 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, rescheduled for Feb 19. Since Feb 14 no pain and fever.  Treatment:  1. Because I had a thought that I may be developed a nasopharyngeal Herpes zoster infection, on Feb 11 I started  Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times a day. 2. Ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times. 3. Augmentin (stopped after 4 days, on Feb 7).

There was no itching, just a rash.  I took 1 Zyrtec allergy pill at bedtime and by the morning (today) the rash was almost gone. Now, 48 hours after vaccination, the rash is gone.

Didn&#39;t seek medical attention, just plowed through it.  I imagined a biological warfare agent would have felt like that. &#34;I thought I was gunna DIE!&#34;

A 67-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1686, Expiry date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration (arm left) on 18Jan2021, 12:00 (noon) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization, at 67 years old. Medical history included torn rotator cuffs from an unspecified date. The patient previously took Flu shot for immunization. Patient stated his last vaccination he had was the flu shot 6 months before on an unspecified date, that was a while back. Patient had pain in his left arm at the injection site. He is not sleeping because the pain is waking him up. It has been more than a week at 10 days, and it still hurts. It is very sore by his bicep. Events occurred on 19Jan2021, reported as started hurting the next day maybe, it was not immediately after. He says since then he has had pain, and in the past, he has had torn rotator cuffs, and those hurt, but he was not sleeping due to this pain now, he fell asleep at 06:00AM this morning from sheer exhaustion (Jan2021). He says he is very uncomfortable sitting, he can&#39;t lay on that side, and he can&#39;t get comfortable. He was taking MOTRIN 800 mg as needed, and he put ASPERCREME on it. He says that his MOTRIN was prescribed by a doctor, it was the only thing working for the pain for this. He says he also tried Naproxen, then says it&#39;s Aleve actually, he has only taken this once. It was 220 mg, he took one by mouth, one time. He applied the ASPERCREME to the injection site about three times last week, he says he was experimenting here, he does not know. He says he tried ice which helped a little bit, ice always helps, but when it wears out it comes back. He stated he feels the pain walking, when he is putting his shirt on, sitting in his recliner, it is constant. His vaccine card is handwritten, there is no NDC written on there. It has no information about the syringe that was used, NDC/LOT/EXP information were unknown, they didn&#39;t put it down or the information on the card for his wallet. Patient stated he saw a doctor but not for the injection site pain. He stated if it was just initial pain, he wouldn&#39;t be asking but it has been 10 days now, he thought it would be gone by now, he tried to see how long it could last on the paper they gave and called the number from the paper. He says he had no swelling, it was just really sore, he would like to know if this is normal, if so, he can hang on and tough it out. Treatment was given in response to the events. Outcome of the events Injection site pain, not sleeping, it still hurts, it is very sore by his bicep was not recovered. Outcome of the events sheer exhaustion and is very uncomfortable sitting was unknown.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot unknown for first and second doses) solution for injection intramuscular on an unknown dates (at the age of 67-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) low dose and ongoing atorvastatin. The patient got a very sore arm at the injection site after both doses but no other side effects. The patient took low dose aspirin and atorvastatin and was concerned that the reason for the lack of side effects was that the medications may have blunted the vaccine immune response. A doctor told the me (patient) that aspirin was not stopped in the trials. The outcome of the events was unknown.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Take  Allegra to relieve them. No effect. Each day more rashes appear. Discussed with Dr. who recommended I generate a report.  Early am of the 3/5 I had a very fast heart beat that woke me up. It was fast but not pounding. From the moment I work up it lasted around 10 seconds then stopped. Did not repeat. Dr  did not think it was related to the vaccine. A fast heartbeat like this has never happened before.

Thereafter in about 24 hours the dermatitis erupted again and he developed hand swelling, redness and itching.  he consulted his physician and was given oral prednisone at 50mg /d for 7 days which calmed the dermatitis.  We reviewed the possibility of his rash erupting again after he receives dose 32--for which he is here today--and the possibility that the previous corticosteroids that he was given might inhibit a full immune response from the vaccine.  He opts to receive the second dose today anyway and it is administered.  This is to report the worsening of the dermatitis after the first dose was given.  He still had remnants of a dermatitis (wrinkled skin, etc)

                                                developed a rash in my back and groin that did not go away; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Feb2021 09:30 AM (at the age of 67-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety and some lactose intolerance. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine; fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC); azelastine hydrochloride, fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA); amlodipine; and atorvastatin calcium (ATORVAS).  The patient previously took lisinopril and experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 22Jan2021 09:30 AM (at the age of 67-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Approximately 5 days after receiving the 2nd Covid 19 vaccine on 15Feb2021 12:00, the patient developed a rash in his back and groin that did not go away until 3 days ago when he was prescribed Prednisone 20 mg (2 a day) by an allergist. Prior to the Prednisone the rash was very persistent and increasing in intensity. The patient didnot know if it had to be with the vaccine, but five days later and did not respond to antihistamines or over the counter ointments for rash. No covid prior vaccination nor covid tested post vaccination. The event resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the event was unknown.    Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

A 67-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EK9231; Expiration Date was not reported), via intramuscular route of administration in Arm Right on 23Jan2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostatomegaly, drug hypersensitivity both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included finasteride (FINAS-TERIDE); ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 23Jan2021 12:30, he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient states he felt fine at the clinic after 15 mins and then after he left he felt lightheaded and dizzy and this continued on. Patient says his reaction was about 20 plus minutes after his injection, which he was fine when he got the injection, he became lightheaded and that has kind of continued on. He says it was pretty bad on the first day, then the second day it went away. He says a couple days later it came back, with his heart kind of racing, and he was still experiencing that though it was getting better. This was not something he had be-fore and he feels anxious and body is tight with dizziness. He says he experiences it periodically, and today it was not bad, but yesterday it came back again. He says he was concerned about that, but he hasn&#39;t passed out or anything. He says he went to the doctor and had an EKG and blood work done, which were all ok. He says it has been off and on, and he was kind of very anxious and tense as well, his insides are tight and jittery, sort of. He says he didn&#39;t see that listed as a common side effect. He says he had soreness at injection site, that went away, and he had no fever or any-thing, just the lightheadedness. He says he wants to see about the lightheadedness, if it had been reported by others, since he didn&#39;t notice it as a common reaction, to see what is going on there, since it has been over a week and it hasn&#39;t totally gone away, so he is concerned about having his second dose. Am doing better now. Went to the doctor for tests on 27Jan2021 (Wednesday). Test results were okay. Patient states these are not some of the common side effects he has seen or read about. He would like to know when will his symptoms go away. Patient would like to know if he should receive the second dose that was scheduled in less than two weeks. Patient states he called his doctor had an EKG and blood work done and his tests were negative. The outcome for soreness at injection site was recovered on an unspecified date and for rest events was recovering.

I took some Benedril which helped with swelling. that was the most severe after effect. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the vaccine because i had not been anywhere that weekend and had not  put my hands on anything unusual that i don&#39;t normally touch. It only happened to my hands. Other than that i had minor flu like symtoms from the shot,  achiness and slight fatigue feeling. I had an ER doctor look at my hands when i went in today to get help for my bronchitis, which i had some before the covid shot. It got worse on Monday. He perscribed prednisone which has pretty much taken the hand spots away..i was tested negative for covid today(1/19/21) by the way.

A 68-years-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EK5730) in Left arm, intramuscular on 06Jan2021 around 11:00 at SINGLE DOSE to prevent COVID, famotidine, oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 40 mg, 2x/day for gastritis .  Medical history included gastritis, ongoing diabetes (diagnosed 3 years ago), ongoing hyperparathyroidism (diagnosed many, many years ago), ongoing sjogren&#39;s syndrome (diagnosed recently this year), gout from 2010 and ongoing , coronary atherosclerosis from Nov2020 and ongoing, ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (diagnosed many years ago), asthma from 2020 and ongoing , sleep apnoea from 2019 and ongoing, crohn&#39;s disease from 1981 and ongoing, and abdominal pain. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID] (reported he takes aspirin everyday and the aspirin causes him to have some abdominal pain).   The patient was administered with the first dose of the vaccine on 06Jan2021 and after that he developed a rash in the face that was itchy symmetric and bilateral on 08Jan2021. The rash was bilateral and symmetrical. The event was reported serious due to medically significant. Upon transfer, the caller clarifies he did not take steroids for the rash. A few days prior to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, he started taking a new oral medication. So, he doesn&#39;t know if the rash is from the new medication or the vaccine, but he decided to call and report this event just in case. He clarifies the name of the new medication was famotidine. Today (12Jan2021) was the first day it was much better. Caller confirmed he did not take any steroids, the only medication he took was an antihistamine for the management of the symptoms. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported rash in the face that was itchy symmetric and bilateral occurred two days after the first dose of COVID 19 Vaccine, BNT162B2.  Based on the plausible temporal association, the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events and the administration of the suspect.

Over the following six days, symptomes frogresses to extreme skin sensitivity and diffuse aching of chest cage and muscles, back, associated with fatigue and stiffness of joints especially after being at rest and trying to move. By the 6th day after onset of symptoms, an erythematous eruption developed along the left T7 dermatome, becoming more pronounced on the 7th day, but not the true vesicular rash we usually see in zoster dermatitis. Discomfort is relieved by taking excedrin and tylenol. I did not try NSAIDs due to gastritis reaction. No fever or chills, sore throat, cough, etc. I started Valtrex today  to be taken tid.

I&#39;m wondering if one or more of the vitamins and supplements I took this morning, including Slo-Niacin, fish oil, multivitamins and extra D and C interacted with the vaccine.  I took one Benadryl  tablet at 2:00 p.m. today, which seems to be calming down the redness and itching.

Ibuprofen taken helped diminish pain.  36 hours later still sore but much reduced pain.  Physically active use of arm  I think helped reduction in pain.    Expect after 48 hours to be pain free I hope.

A 68-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 15:30 at single dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included back disorder and is waiting for back surgery, high blood pressure, and very likely diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon, didn&#39;t notice anything until Saturday. On Saturday afternoon (23Jan2021) he had a couple severe/serious episodes of shortness of breath. He has no other symptoms. It was better on Sunday and is better today but he still feels uncomfortable on Jan2021. He bought a oximeter today and while at rest he is at 94 but when he gets up to do anything it goes to 80. He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

                                                itching of scalp; forehead had slight swelling; cold sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 68-years-old male patient received second dose for bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration, on the left arm, on 29Jan2021 at 12:00 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), chronic acid reflux, and Caisson&#39;s sickness. The patient has no known allergies. The patient has other unspecified medications taken in two weeks. The patient previously took his first dose of bnt162b2 (lot no. EN3246) on 08Jan2021 at 12:00 PM, on the left arm for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has not taken other vaccine in four weeks. On 02Feb2021 at 21:00, several days after vaccine had strong itching of scalp, lasting several hours prior to bedtime. Noticed that his forehead had slight swelling at bedtime.

On 2/28/021 I developed pain, erythema, warmth and swelling at the 4th MCP in my L hand which persisted for several days.  I contacted my rheumatologist, and saw him on 03/04.  Since this was my first episode of inflammation in years, we elected to treat it conservatively with naproxen OTC.  My symptoms resolved after several days, but then I had successive episodes of pain, erythema, warmth and swelling in my R 5th MCP, R ankle, L 5th TMT, L 5th MCP, L knee and R wrist over the next 3 weeks--- in the pattern of palindromic rheumatism similar to that my symptoms had first began 18 years ago.

Very Erratic and disrupted sleep for Days. The Major Adverse effect is that these Reactions are within the Range of Published and known Effects. I treated them at home with Rest and Some Tylenol, but was not really capable of normal functioning or to be Employed.. But they were Persistent for 6 1/2 Days....   I have spoken to No One who have had the symptoms last this long. It seemed and felt like descriptions  of Real Covid or past Influenzas but the symptoms seemed more severe and longer. I have spoken with many who have had real Covid who&#39;s symptoms and length of illness were milder... I did contact my Physician to advise of this event.

                                                Several episodes of mild transient and migratory urticaric skin hives; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN9581) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 03Feb2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, no concomitant medications and was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient previously took ibuprofen from an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported he had several episodes of mild transient and migratory urticaric skin hives starting on 04Feb2021 at 07:00, which he was not certain were related to the vaccine. He reported the first episode occurred 17 hours after vaccination, located over right knee and lower leg and lasted 2 hours. The second episode occurred 36 hours after vaccination located on left forearm and lasted one hour. The third episode occurred 48 hours after vaccination located over right knee and lasted 2 hours. The patient experienced no other symptoms and reported that all resolved spontaneously. The event was reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. No treatment was provided for the event. The clinical outcome of several episodes of mild transient and migratory urticaric skin hives was recovered in Feb2021. It was also reported that since vaccination the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Admission to ER for suspected cardiac event.  Intense pain continues for 4.5 hours despite multiple administrations of fentanyl. ER tests negative for heart attack. CT interpretation does not rule out suspected aortic dissection due to fluid around aneurysm (later ruled out with second CT). Transfer to another Hospital for possible cardiac repair. Surgeon disagrees with CT reading. Three days in ICU and Step Down, CT, Cardiac Echo, Carotid Echo, Chest X Ray, Blood Tests all negative for cardiac event.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK9231, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization (Over 65 years old; 2nd group to receive in state). The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. Patient got the COVID Vaccine last Thursday (07Jan2021). He had soreness in his arm, which is fine, but when he took the Band-Aid off he had a bruise where he got the shot (13Jan2021). His wife told him he should call and report this. About the arm soreness, it was really sore the first couple of days. The nurse said if he moves his arm and works it, it would help. It was sore for about 2-3 days. Sore to the touch, but not painful. There were no treatment given. They were asking if they should contact his physician, if this is normal. He has had vaccines before, but never had a bruise. The outcome of the event Bruise where he got the shot was not recovered, while for other event was unknown.

I used an ice pack for about 40 minutes before I had to leave for work. It felt stiff and sore all day and when I returned from work, at about 7:30PM, when I removed my shirt, I saw that it was red, somewhat swollen &amp; felt hard around the area where I was injected.  At 10PM it&#39;s still that way.

                                                when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain; feel a little tightness in his breathing/ tightness/shortness of breath; on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%; feel a little bit of heat on his forehead; nose dripping/nose was running; seems like it isn&#39;t working; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

                                                Developed a rash on both forearms 2 hrs. after the vaccine while at home. over the course of the next three days it spread to my chest, underarms, lower back, inside both thighs, and lower kegs.  Large welts developed in those areas.  I contacted a covid nurse and she called me and advised over the counter Benadryl for symptoms and to contact my doctor. I messaged him and sent photos of the infected areas. He prescribed Prednisone 10 mg to take in a five day burst.  It has been two weeks now and this rash is just now getting better. I wonder if a second dose is advisable.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date in Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included unspecified medications; patient reported that he takes a lot of medications. On 19Jan2021, five days prior to the report, the patient experienced itching on his skin but it is on different parts of his skin. He stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if it is something with vaccine or it is something else but I, like a 5 days ago, I started to feel like itching on my skin but it is on different parts of my skin and I felt this is not nice and now I am looking for information like if you have like allergy or something. I don&#39;t know if it is something in vaccine or it is something in my food or something else, like that kind of allergy. I don&#39;t know what we can do with it.&#34; The patient received corrective treatment. On 23Jan2021, he took some Benadryl and on the morning o 24Jan2021, he took his Zyrtec (name not clarified) from his regular allergist. He stated that he has been prescribed for that. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                None of my health care providers have been able to explain the cause of my sudden loss of vision in my left eye at approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb 2021.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. on 8 Feb I called my ophthalmologist&#39;s answering service and my ophthalmologist called me back shortly thereafter.  She told me I should go to the ER which I did at approx. 4:00 a.m. where blood tests were done, an ultrasound of my left eye, CT scan of my head, and MRI of my head were performed all with negative results.  When my vision was tested at the ER using the standard wall chart, I was unable to see the largest letter on the chart with my left eye.  I saw my ophthalmologist at approx. 1:40 p.m. the same day after my 6 1/2 hour ER visit. I was diagnosed with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.  Both of my eyes were dilated and photos were taken of each eye.  I was given an injection of Avastin in my left eye.  As of today, 12 Feb 2021, I am still functionally blind in my left eye.  I can see general large objects but am unable to see details or read written words either near or far.  Prior to approx. 10:15 p.m. on 7 Feb, my vision was as it had been for several years prior with little if any degradation.  I typically have an annual eye exam by my ophthalmologist but due to Covid-19 my last eye exam was 9 Dec 2019 at which time there was nothing to suggest that I would have such loss of sight in either of my eyes.  I am a healthy person who takes no or very little medication when prescribed.  I have never been hospitalized (other than this ER visit) or diagnosed with any significant medical condition.  In late Dec 2020 following routine blood tests, I had a teleconference &#34;physical&#34; with my PCP at which time I was declared to be healthy.  Upon leaving the ER at approx. 10:30 a.m. on 8 Feb my &#34;end of visit vitals&#34; were recorded as blood pressure 110/63, BMI 20.92, weight 150 lbs., height 5&#39;11&#34;, temperature 97.6 F, pulse 67, respiration 16, and oxygen saturation 95%.  Late last year I had my usual flu vaccination without any side effects.  After almost 2 weeks, I do still have a bruise at the Pfizer vaccine injection site on my left arm and I experienced mild muscle soreness the evening after my vaccination and the following morning.  Normally I have no adverse reaction to vaccinations.

I had a mild fever (99.4) which was about 2 degrees above normal. The selling has subsided in the second 24 hours and my temperature returned to normal. There is still moderate swelling and sensitivity. I had not seen this reported as a common side effect of the vaccination. I thought it should be reported.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber. The patient&#39;s second dose was on 19Feb2021. The outcome of the events stomach cramps, felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t was recovered on 30Jan2021, not a lot of energy/little lack of energy, not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine/whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine was recovering, while unknown for the rest of the events.

                                                I woke up with slightly itchy, severe skin rash on 2/23/2021 following second vaccine injection at 10:58 am on 2/21/2021. The rash completely covered both buttocks, the  top front inside of both thighs, both hips, the front groin area, inside/bottom of both feet. Given the extent and intensity of rash, it must have started on Monday 2/22/2021. The rash was red-purple with white spots (perhaps hives).   I contacted my primary care physician&#39;s office on 2/23/2021 and had a televisit with the nurse. Her diagnosis was Allergic Dermatitis/Itching. She prescribed Banophen (50 mg), Triamcinolone cream, and Cetirizine HCL (10 mg). I took the medicine.  Continued below.

                                                18-20 hours following the vaccination, after going to bed, I started experiencing chills, followed by intense, all-over body aches. This was accompanied by either bizarre dreams or hallucinations during the night. When I awoke in the morning I was very unrested and very unstable. My morning coffee did not taste appealing. By 30 hours after the vaccination I had returned to feeling better, albeit with a mildly sore injection site, and was able to return to normal activity. No treatment was sought.  No further issues presented themselves.

Rash was initially maculopapular with erythematous base.  As rash continued to spread around waist, areas became vesicular grouped lesions.   Experienced severe pain, stinging, burning at lesion sites and around flank area to back.  Continuing neuropathic-type pain.   Treated symptoms with calamine lotion,   topical patch, and ibuprofen for discomfort.   Lesions have now crusted for the most part,  rash in various stages of healing with a few vesicular areas remaining.  Continues to have neuropathic pain to area.

                                                My left arm muscle located on underarm between elbow and injection site, halfway between elbow and injection site higher up became extremely sore to the touch and prevented me from lifting my arm to preform functions.  Today is much better and function has mostly returned. The reason I am reporting is because I just (jan.29 2021) tore my rotator cuff on right  shoiulder and the loss of function is similar. Function is returning on left arm so no worried, the right shoulder will need shoulder replacement surgery.  But that was the effect on this adverse event. Loss of function to left arm about 3 days with improvement after 36 hours. Kind of a delayed response, so not sure its related. But I didn&#39;t injure the left so probably related.

                                                Three to four days after the injection I began to feel muscle and joint aches in my entire body along with fatigue. These symptoms grew in intensity and lasted about seven days, then suddenly diminished and then stopped.  Dates: (1) January 8, 2021: injection; (2)  January 11 - 13: beginning of symptoms; (3) January 16-17: lessening of symptoms; (4) January 18: disappearance of symptoms.   I also experienced soreness in my left arm at the site of the injection.  That began several hours after the injection and was much more intense than the soreness I usually experience with flu shots.  The soreness lasted about 24 hours, again much longer than my experience with flu shorts.  It then suddenly diminished and then stopped--same pattern as the aches and fatigue described above.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 15Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergic rhinitis; no known allergies. Concomitant medications included guaifenesin (ROBITUSSIN), levosalbutamol (LEVALBUTEROL), azelastine hcl, and unspecified vitamin (reported as &#34;vit&#34;). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Jan2021 (15:45), the patient experienced mild adverse events reported as headache, mild rash within approximately 8 hours after vaccination, mild stomach upset in the morning after vaccination. The patient was treated with 10 mls Benadryl and chamomile tea on 16Jan2021 &#34;mor&#34;. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination (unspecified date) with unknown result. The patient had been tested for Covid with Nasal Swab on 01Jan2021 (Ag) and on 07Jan2021 (PCR) both with negative result. The outcome of events was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes (controlled by food not by injection), coronary artery spasm (blood vessels that occasionally collapsed), glaucoma, and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included albuterol for asthma, atorvastatin (LIPITOR), glyceryl trinitrate (NITROGLYCERIN) for coronary artery spasm, and numbers of eye drops (unspecified) for glaucoma. The patient had taken the COVID-19 vaccine just not too long ago and had good number of non-serious side effects. The patient was not really concerned with these side effects that she had. On 13Jan2021, the patient had the little bit of pain from the injection site but that&#39;s common with any injection, so he did not count it, but next day the events started, and he still had some, but they were subsiding. The next events happened the next day after administration (14Jan2021). The patient had the injection site pain and the arm is still weak, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, and feeling unwell on 14Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the events.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3249, Expiry Date: May2021), intramuscularly on 15Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single, left arm for covid-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications reported as none. There was some/fair amount of bleeding that soaked/saturated the bandage after the shot and a bruise developed that was 3 inches around and was there for 10 days and he still had the bruise. He said that there was also a cold sensation at the injection site when it was administered and he felt a chill on his arm. He said that he was calling because he wanted to make sure the first dose was effective. He said that his 2nd dose was due next week. The bleeding resolved within the hour and soaked the band aid itself. He said that it was not persistent bleeding it was just immediately after the injection. He also had some significant soreness at the injection site and stated that the injection site was still sore if he presses on it.  He never bothered to look at his arm and stated that he noticed the bruise was there about 8 days later. It might have been there prior to that, but he did not know. He had blood work done on the 25Jan2021 and asked for a Covid antibody test and it came back negative. The patient asked should there be a positive antibody test at this point? The patient asked did this mean he didn&#39;t develop immunity? The bruise had diminished but still there. The soreness was still there. The soreness was not sore if pressure was not put on it and was never sore if he laid on it. The patient was asking if Pfizer considered the vaccine to be viable. He was not on a blood thinner. Onset date of events &#34;some bleeding that soaked the bandage&#34; was 15Jan2021, of bruise was unknown, &#34;some significant soreness and stated that the injection site is still sore if he presses on it&#34; was 15Jan2021, &#34;a very cold sensation at the injection site&#34; was 15Jan2021. The outcome of event &#34;some bleeding that soaked the bandage&#34; was recovered on 15Jan2021, of bruise and &#34;some significant soreness and stated that the injection site is still sore if he presses on it&#34; was recovering, of other events was unknown.

Allergy consulted due to anaphylactic reaction several hours after procedure. Patient was stable on RA at time of presentation and vitals were normal and stable during the procedure from 8-9 AM. Procedure log reviewed. He received fentanyl, versed, heparin, omnipaque, and xylocaine during the procedure. No immediate reactions noted and no change in vitals during procedure. He tolerated procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac recovery room on RA with normal vitals.   At 1217, patient received percocet and at 1 PM, desaturations noted on flowsheets (84% from RA). Noted pain level of 10/10. HR increased to 130s-150s and BP did drop as low as 99/87. Per notes, he developed shortness of breath, rash, and itching with this. Given albuterol, racemic epinephrine, diphenhydramine IV, famotidine IV, and solumedrol. After developing nausea, he was given IM epinephrine at 2:10 pm.

The events were reported as non-serious. The clinical course was reported as: The bleeding at injection site saturated the Band-Aid, but subsided quickly; the large bruise, which was now diminished, but still exists some 17 days later (as reported); sensation of chill/cold at vaccination site at time of injection; and soreness, although not significant, it still persists to this date of reporting. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab: negative on 26Jan2021. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of bleeding at injection site was recovered on an unspecified date, sensation of chill/cold at vaccination site at time of injection was recovered on 15Jan2021, and large bruise and soreness was recovering.

                                                noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all; he felt fullness in his right ear; sore left arm where he got injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EM9809, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 12:30 (at 71-year-old) at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (mild hypertension and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-6 years ago), hyperlipidemia (mild hyperlipidemia and it is well controlled, it was diagnosed 5-10 years ago). He stated in Aug, he tested positive for antibodies through Lab and was still positive a month later. He wondered how that might effect the decision of if he should get the second dose, if he is potentially immune. He had no symptoms but tested negative with PCR test. His girlfriend who he lives with tested negative for antibodies. Height was reported as 6 feet to 6 feet one inch tall. Weight was reported as 176-178lbs, he thought he may have gained a few pounds. There were no concomitant medications. The caller had the first dose of the vaccine 10Feb2021 12:30. 5 days later he felt fullness in his right ear (Feb2021) and noticed diminished hearing in the right ear (Feb2021), maybe 20-30% less. He was comparing how much he could hear the ticking of his watch in his left and right ear and couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all. He went to an ENT and they found that it was reduced in the right ear secondary to a nerve problem and wasn&#39;t secondary to anything else. The doctor read online on an ENT site, a couple of people had acute bouts of decreased hearing. They were treated with steroids and resolved. His provider prescribed him with a high dose of steroids, 70 mg. He was going to take it after dinner but all of the sudden he could hear the ticking better. He held off on taking the steroid and the next morning his hearing was fine. He went back and they retested and it was back to normal. He had taken Naprosyn and is not sure if that played a part in improving things. It resolved not even 24 hours after the initial symptoms. It resolved on its own. He asked, is this a side effect that has been reported? Are there any cases of this happening in one ear rather than 2? Could it be a contraindication getting the second dose? His doctor is researching it and he is supposed to call early next week about this. He asked how many people were in the clinical trials that the side effect data is based on. The caller stated he heard someone report that he doesn&#39;t believe that people getting the vaccine necessarily need both doses of the vaccine. They are finding after a week after the first dose they have relative immunity and might not need the second dose. The caller asked how effective this vaccine might be on new variants, how effective just one dose of the vaccine is, if Pfizer is looking into mixing the vaccines- whether it will be something that can be interchanged with other Covid-19 vaccines, asked where he could find updates on medical information about  this in the future. The caller stated he wanted to thank Pfizer for developing the vaccine as quickly as they did. Retired psychiatrist calling about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who says he got his first dose on 10Feb in (State name), and had a sore left arm where he got the injection (Feb2021) then 5 days later had fullness in his right ear with his hearing diminished. He says he called his otolaryngologist because he had had a hearing test a few months ago, and was tested again now and there was a moderate decrease of hearing in his right ear. He says he would like to know if this could be a possible side effect, since he has read of reports and his otolaryngologist knew of two reports where people did report hearing loss. He says that he was treated acutely with steroids at high dose of 70mg for which he filled the script, then called his internist who was ambivalent with him taking a high dose. Caller says then within a few hours, his hearing was better, and by the next morning it was normal, and he went back to the ENT and his hearing was the same as it was a few months ago. He says he did not take the steroid he was prescribed, the Prednisone, he took Naproxen, and since it may have been a nerve problem with hearing diminished related to auditory nerve, it seemed to get better in a number of hours. He says he has reported this already to VAERS. Caller says his right ear is better now, it got better within a a few hours after he saw his doctor, then it was completely better by the next morning. He says that after they tested his hearing due to the fullness in his ear and hearing being diminished it got  better on its own. He says on the next hearing test his hearing was exactly back to normal. He says he did take Naproxen once or twice during that time period, 20 or less hour period, more like 12 hours, one 220mg tablet each time, he doesn&#39;t know whether that contributed to helping. Naproxen (EXP Jan2022, LOT: ODRO445). He says that the reason he is calling is to see whether Pfizer has had similar reports. He says that he saw on a website that 12 people were reporting deafness or blindness, but it seemed to be an (name), so he took it with a grain of salt. He says he would like to know whether people have been reporting with issues for hearing, unilaterally or bilaterally, or what results have been with some people. Caller says unfortunately the website he mentioned was obviously anti vaccine and claimed to be with the (name) or version of the CDC and said that they were reporting they had 12 people reporting deafness and blindness from COVID vaccine and made it sound like the most dangerous vaccine in the world, but it was a conspiracy website that claimed it was with the equivalent of CDC. Caller does not have website addresses to provide or details about reports on that site.  Caller says he looked at the (name) and it said nothing about this kind of possible side effect. He says he doesn&#39;t know if his could be related to getting the vaccine, or if he should still get a second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;noticed diminished hearing in the right ear/couldn&#39;t hear a tick at all&#34; and &#34;he felt fullness in his right ear&#34; was recovered in Feb2021, while for other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported unilateral  deafness was unlikely related to bnt162b2.  This was  an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

Immediately after fever, nerve from lower back to right knee became very painful (more than ever before). This nerve had been giving me trouble for several years (spinal stenosis). A physical therapist alleviated the pain on 2/18 and 2/23, but the pain did not go away until 2/26. [This association of fever and reoccurrence or increased pain in areas where pain had receded has occurred in the past, usually associated with the flu. The same scenario occurred then; 4 to 8 hours of fever followed by sudden remission

Outside temp was about 58 degrees F. Two days later numbness spread to adjoining index and ring fingers. They became very painful and sensitive to touch. Visits to primary care doctor, hand specialist and vascular surgeon is pointing to circulation problem. Finger tip continue to be extremely painful with no relief. Large black areas have formed on two fingers and is spreading to my right hand

                                                shingles; he started feeling strange; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 71 years, on 20Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included white blood cell count decreased from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient stated that his white blood cell count was usually on the low side and his doctor sends him to a hematologist to do whatever, then they say he was fine. Concomitant medication included an unspecified flu shot. The patient said that he had his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot 20Jan2021, and this coming Wednesday he was supposed to have his second shot, but unfortunately in the interim he found out he has shingles. He says he would like to know if he can get a second shot or would he need to hold off. He says that developed shingles 9 days later after getting first COVID-19 vaccine shot (31Jan2021), and he doesn&#39;t want to do something that will be a problem. He says that he was on an antiviral to treat the shingles. No further details provided about the antiviral. He says he didn&#39;t go see his doctor until last Wednesday, he thinks he has been suffering from shingles since 07Feb2021 or a little before that when he started feeling strange. The patient clarified he meant 31Jan2021 since he began dealing with this. The patient said when he was diagnosed with shingles they didn&#39;t do any tests, the doctor walked into the room and looked at him, though he didn&#39;t have a lot then, over the days it has gotten worse. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of shingles (herpes zoster). The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 71-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 23Feb2021 at 12:45 PM (at the age of 71-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, cholesterol, abdominal discomfort. Concomitant medications included lisinopril taken for hypertension, simvastatin for blood cholesterol, omeprazole for abdominal discomfort, and multivitamin. Historic vaccination included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 71-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 24Feb2021, about 12 hours later almost to the hour, the patient had symptoms. The patient had fever, real bad headache, chills/couldn&#39;t get warm, weak, his arm really hurt where he got the shot, couldn&#39;t fall asleep. The patient clinical course was reported as follows: About 12 hours later almost to the hour, he had symptoms including: fever, real bad headache, chills, and the fever ran somewhere 100 or a little over he guesses. This lasted most of that morning on Wednesday on the 24Feb2021. He took his temperature with an oral digital thermometer. He reports his temperature usually ranges 97.7-97.6 somewhere around there. And he couldn&#39;t get warm. He had a mattress heater turned up and he felt weak and since he&#39;s by himself he has to get up to get water and he put his heavy robe on then he got back in bed. He never went to sleep, he couldn&#39;t fall asleep, his arm really hurt where he got the shot. There was a little ache with the first one but this one here really, really was bothering him. When he first got the second shot, he hates needles, it was a little sore and then when this started it really started to hurt and it was warm. That went on to the morning, then it started letting up a bit. His daughter came by and made him chicken soup and he felt a little better, still weakfish. His fever went down kind of far and he laid down the rest of the day. Towards dinner time or so he felt warm but didn&#39;t have fever, he went the opposite from being chilled to being warm but his temperature was around 98. Then later on he was taking some pain medicine, called his doctor and asked what he should take for the headache. Take whatever he has there is what he was told. Acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It says Headache relief, caller states he is just about blind, acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It got rid of whatever he had. Patient stated he needs to change the thingy on his CCTV. Clarified he uses a CCTV magnifying system, it&#39;s a camera system with the 24 inch monitor. He felt better then he fell asleep around 10 that night and he woke up around 4:00AM on the 25Feb2021. He reports whatever fever he had, he was soaked but he felt really ok then from then on. He finally got up around 7-730 AM and he&#39;s feeling ok now. If he had a fever it broke. He reported it seems to be improved on the 25Feb2021. He was feeling pretty good he started making coffee so he didn&#39;t feel bad and he hasn&#39;t had anything since. He reports his arm is not bothering him unless he pokes it. It&#39;s the same thing with the flu shot, if he pushes on it in a certain place he knows he got the shot. The injection site is not warm, all that went away on 25Feb2021. The clinical outcome of fever, real bad headache, chills/ couldn&#39;t get warm, weak, couldn&#39;t fall asleep, was recovered on 25Feb2021. The clinical outcome of his arm really hurt where he got the shot was unknown.

A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EN6203; Expiration Date: Jun2021) dose 2 via an unspecified route of admin-istration on 07Mar2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included diabetes mellitus; he does not take medication for it. It was controlled by diet and exercise, high blood pressure, high lipids, herpes zoster from Oct2019, bell&#39;s palsy from Oct2019, herpes zoster oticus from Oct2019, paralysis, vertigo, ear disorder, paraesthesia oral and his tongue was tingly. Concomitant medications included alprazolam taken for sleep disorder, simvastatin taken for lipids increased, alprazolam (XANAX) taken for sleep disorder.  The patient had his second shot last sunday and had a discussion had with his doctor&#39;s nurse this morning that centered around people taking the Moderna and had some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or some-thing like that and he wanted to call about what had happened. He has had overlapping stuff from cer-vical stenosis that manifests on the left side on his shoulder arm and hands and also about a year and half ago Oct2019 he had shingles in his ear and mouth on the left side of face. He had Bell&#39;s palsy and Ramsey Hunt syndrome number 2. He had paralysis, droopy mouth, eye wouldn&#39;t close, vertigo, ear issues, hearing drop and that recovered which was weird. He went to physical therapy until early last year before COVID then he was steered away from that. About 10 months ago some of the symptoms came back in a odd way. His eye had the feeling like it couldn&#39;t close. His eyelids had at night the muscles in his face on the left side face felt taut. The inside of his gum felt like his skin was thicker, he was not sure it was the sensation and that never went away. With the shingles he had an issue where down the side of his tongue was tingly, these things overlap and it was either very little or really an-noying. In last 10 months it had got quite a bit better until about 5-6 weeks ago it was back to where it was, it was just annoying on and off. Then he got the shot sunday, and it was weird at first, he was writing it off as both stress and relief and other things. He was not dizzy and that evening the left side of his mouth went bonkers, it wound up being like when the shingles were acting up on the inside of his mouth it felt tingly and weird, and it was confined to the left half of his face and nothing else. He did not have droopiness or any Bell&#39;s palsy kind of thing had gone away the Ramsey-Hunt syndrome, he says it was a series of things and he has number 2, he does not know what the other ones are, but it was something that comes along with the chicken pox or the herpes zoster virus. The stenosis, the cervical stenosis, the left is the main problem, but the right was not far behind with regard to nerve compression, the right does not bother him as much in the way of tingling and numbness. The weird thing is he had his hands sitting in his lap and he moved his thumb towards his forefinger, there was a couple inches between and it felt like there was a rubber band pulling his thumb back, it happened 2-3 times he was fooling around with it and it went away, the sensation was still there a little in the back ground, the rest of him the right side of him was fine and today is a lot better like he said things over lap so he is not saying anything has anything to do with the vaccine but he is operating under the as-sumption that if Moderna patients are having some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or something similar, if he has left over inflammation and in Nov2019, he had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), when he first got sick and then he had another one done and his neurologist said on an unspecified date in Aug that he still sees some nerve inflammation particularly down jaw line, he saw inflammation from 2019 to 2020 he still seen inflammation and the upper part of his eye, the brow seems to behave as if there may be some inflammation running through it. His hand on the right is not doing the thing is his left thumb, it is being weird and the thing sunday night with his mouth. He thinks the whole idea is that the vaccine wakes up the immune system and gets it to recognize the RNA for COVID and generate anti-bodies and if it is acting like inflammation gets the body&#39;s attention, he is not a biologist but maybe it also caught on to his nerve inflammation and took a look at his nerves and cause them to bounce around and have other things occur that were more intense and he was trying to report to let some-one know that the underlying things left over from his shingles, he does not know about the rest of it because sleeping wrong could affect his neck shoulders and arms, he was not sure if it could be an is-sue with the vaccine, there was no clear definite thing, but the thing sunday night with his mouth was definitely far more, he thought this was the way he felt in his mouth a couple weeks after he got the shingles diagnosis like he had hives on inside of his cheek and tongue, it was crazy with extra salivation but he did not have the hives. The last time he got a vaccine it was the Shingrix it was probably too late last year, he got pretty sick off of it with flu like symptoms but he doesn&#39;t ever want another run in with shingles. It was his second COVID 19 vaccine he got 07Mar and it was the same day that the thing with his mouth happened and that was the most noticeable aspect of it, if he had not had the vaccine he would be sitting here right now just thinking he was having a bad day it runs down the left side of his tongue and stops smack in middle of the front of it. It jumps over sometimes but he was not sure if the nerve endings go on both sides of the tip of tongue or not. It has improved since sunday there was a span there where it was pretty annoying and he commented that he feels like it did when he first had shingles and over a period of time when he went to bed, whenever that was, it abated a bit. His second dose was EN6203 and it is dated Jun2021. The patient was sure they were trained to draw up the exact correct amount in there but he did not ask to look at it, it did not even occur to him. The only other thing is he was diabetic, he takes no medications for that it was diet and exercise controlled both of which COVID has been horrible for, his weight has gone up because they have a tough climate there, it has been cold for 2.5 months. It was finally starting to get a little better but the primary things he would have would be blood pressure, he takes medication for and the same for lipids he takes Simvastatin for that, the things many males his age are taking medication for. He also takes Alprazolam and Xanax to get to sleep at night, because his brain doesn&#39;t want to shut off, cost of being an engi-neer. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, the thing never changed since, it never showed up anywhere else. he does not know if that disappears but he never ended up getting it again. Apparently it shows up frequently in lungs but it did not with him. Those 2 things would be the top of the list type of things for him. He has never had cancer or blood disease, he had mononucleosis in college. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerized tomogram there was nothing left on. He had one case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, magnetic res-onance imaging was an unknown results on Nov2019. He first got sick and then he had another one done , x-ray: there was nothing left on an unknown date. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncov-ered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Besides just having a sore arm at point of injection, I have had a pox come up on my right forearm. I did have my first shingles shot on November 18th, 2020 at the clinic here. I think it is a single pox and thought I would bring it to your attention. I have had the shingles before so I know what they look like and feel like. Since there is only one, I don&#39;t plan on going to my dermatologist to confirm that it is a pox plus I am not sure if the Covid shot is a side effect that caused the pox or not. It is not painful although itching and not responding much to antiseptic cream. I plan to go for my second Covid shot on January 26 and I am looking forward to it. I don&#39;t go for my second Shingles shot until February 17. There is a possibility that it could be something else besides a pox but wanted to bring it to your attention just in case. Thanks.

The one at the injection site itself, the injection site swelling was about the size of a dime, a red area. He only discovered the red streaks about an hour ago on 14Jan2021, so there has not been no radical change.

The headache responded to an extra tablet of acetaminophen, beyond my normal 1-a-day dosage.   The symptoms are now totally gone after 48 hours.  No need for further consultation or a physician call or visit, in my judgement.

A 72-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 17:00 (at 72-year-old) at single dose (Left Arm) for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included type 2 diabetes (he uses insulin for this), bladder cancer (he was a former bladder cancer patient). Concomitant medication included insulin for Type 2 diabetes. Patient had the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. A week later, he had developed a rash and it turned into shingles. It is currently clearing up and he is taking medications for it. He is due for his second shot of the vaccine on 05Feb2021 and was wondering if there are any recommendations for him not to take it. It was clarified that on 22Jan2021 a rash developed on his face which was found to be shingles. He saw a personal doctor, the doctor even put him on medication. All has gone well, once he started taking the medication the shingles didn&#39;t progress and dried up and is now in the late stage of drying up. He asked if he should be reporting this, he also would like to know if he should get the second covid vaccine. The Rash started on 22Jan2021 and was on the face, hair scalp region. He specified further that the rash was located in the upper right quadrant on his face, also being on the eye lid and hairline. He added that he actually had a second doctor check this as well, because the rash was on the eyelid. His Primary Care doctor had him see a ophthalmologist. Patient clarified that he first thought it was a rash, and after he went to the Dr., she confirmed that what he had was actually the shingles. Outcome described as still with a little bit of redness, but it is healing and it is dried up. Dr prescribed him Valtrex for the shingles. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included that he has had no positive covid tests. In Dec2020, he had the regular covid test and that was negative. In early Jan2021, he had the regular covid test as well as a covid-19 antibody test, and both were negative. Patient mentioned serology test, he then confirmed that he used the word serology inadvertently, and meant antibody. He has had no issues with vaccines in the past. The outcome of the event was recovering.

In the last two weeks, I&#39;ve had intermittent cramping (arms, legs, back) after eating.    Something aggravated my IBS-C and I believe that could be the vaccination.   The cramping is still happening but not continuously.  In the last week, I&#39;ve had tingling or burning twinges on the outside of my right thigh, too, on and off.   Might have been connected with heavy keys in my right front pants pocket and a cell phone on my belt near the thigh.   The same meals that cause cramping seem to cause the tingling, but I don&#39;t know if there is a connection.  The tingling may be from Meralgia paresthetica.

                                                re-occurring shingles that has existed for 20 years/shingles; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 72-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unknown route of administration on Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Plaque psoriasis, ongoing Brace user, ongoing Psoriatic arthritis, ongoing Heart disorder, ongoing Pacemaker complication, ongoing guttate psoriasis. Concomitant medications included etanercept (ENBREL) taken for psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathy, ankylosing spondylitis from 2001 to an unspecified stop date; loratadine (LORTAB) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; clonazepam (KLONOPIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On an unknown date in Jan2021, the patient received the shingles vaccine for immunisation. On an unknown date in Feb2021 (three weeks ago prior to this report), the patient received the first dose of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease). On 27Feb2021, the patient was diagnosed with shingles. The patient had a case of re-occurring shingles that existed for 20. The patient stated that it always occurred at the base of his spine with a size of a golf ball and he had extreme pain and a deep itch with it.

A 72-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 04Feb2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9262) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus Had this for 7-8 years. There were no concomitant medications. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was none. The event reported was severe right shoulder pain near the point of injection, to the point he cant move the arm and it is very stiff. Caller states his pain level was a 9-10 but then corrected this to say it was actually an 8 out of 10 or maybe a little better. The arm pain started on the day he got the injection, 04Feb2021, around 6pm and was noticed to be severe the next day, 05Feb2021. At this point, the pain is about the same since getting severe. He had been taking ibuprofen which he had taken 5 times and acetaminophen which he had taken once. The patient had also used ice and heat for the pain. He also experienced malaise which was very minor. This started the after the shot and he just didn&#39;t feel good that day. It resolved that a same day. The caller&#39;s wife explained that the pain was so intense it was causing him to be close to screaming because he cant use it, and that is not like him. He explained that he is hoping it will get better soon. It was worse at night, it started out ok in the morning but as the day progresses it build up. Caller asked how long will this last. Caller received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Dose 1 last Thursday, 4FEB2021 and is scheduled for their Dose 2 on 25FEB2021. Caller reported to have experienced severe arm pain at the injection site. They wanted to know how long does this side effect usually last and what he should do about the side effects, whether he could proceed with the 2nd shot. AE(s) did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. Relevant Tests was none. No Investigation Assessment. Outcome of the event malaise was recovered on 05Feb2021 and other events was not recovered.

                                                Blood clot in right lung; Sore left arm at injection site; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose intramuscular, administered in the left upper arm on 03Feb2021 at 09:00 (batch/lot number: EL3248) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (prevention). Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from Dec2009 to an unknown date (takes daily pills for rheumatoid arthritis), squamous cell lung cancer early stage from Aug2018 to an unknown date, lung surgery to remove small portion of that and went on chemo in Aug2018, skin cancers prior to getting the vaccine, reading glasses (he needed prior to getting vaccine), blood pressure (abnormal) (takes blood pressure medication; takes daily pills). Family medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included nivolumab (OPDIVO) taken for squamous cell lung cancer early stage from 17Jan2019 to an unspecified stop date (getting it every 4 weeks for 2 years and 3 months; the bag was 480 ml); and unspecified blood pressure medication and rheumatoid arthritis medication. The patient experienced blood clot in right lung on 25Feb2021, sore left arm at injection site on 03Feb2021 and shortness of breath on Feb2021. The patient had the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 03Feb2021 and second one on 01Mar2021. He did not really have any special events but then he had a CT scan on 23Feb2021, which was about 20 days after first shot. When he went in for doctor&#39;s meeting a couple of days later, they said he had a blood clot in right lung. He later stated he was not positive it was in the right lung. He told his doctor that he just got the shot, but they said they had not heard of any reports from Pfizer of people getting blood clots in their lungs after getting it. He thought about reporting then, but did not. He has no evidence that the blood clot in his lung was related to the vaccine. He was also a lung cancer patient and was on an immune therapy drug nivolumab from (name). He has been on it for over 2 years and started Jan2019. He was diagnosed with cancer back in Aug2018. It was squamous cell lung cancer early stage. He had lung surgery to remove small portion of that in Aug2018 and went on chemo. On 17Jan2019, he started on nivolumab immune therapy drug. Fortunately, it worked extremely well. He immediately started recovering and was feeling better. The last few CT scans indicated he had no sign of disease. It does not mean he was cured, but was healthy otherwise. The nivolumab spurred his immune system to eat the cancer cells. It stimulates your immune system. It has been a pretty successful drug and has been on the market for about 5-6 years. He and his wife both got shot on same date. The word on the street was that you should ask for Pfizer because it seems to have less side effects that people can get for vaccines. Pfizer&#39;s reputation has been known for having less common serious side effects. He had a sore arm and it went away about a day later. They prescribed rivaroxaban (XARELTO), a blood thinner, for his blood clot which he went on and got on a day or two later. He was hoping it was gone. He feels better. At the time, he did not know he had the blood clot. He visits his doctor for treatment for nivolumab every 4 weeks and every 4 months, they do a CT scan. At his last visit, he reported that he was still fine but lately experienced some shortness of breath. It was occasional and it comes and goes and was not all the time. He plays golf and noticed the shortness of breath during his game. He quit a couple of holes early and did not want to take any chances. The doctor later told him that a blood clot in your lung can contribute to shortness of breath. When he started rivaroxaban it was 2 pills a day for about 2-3 weeks and it was a starter dose. It was a little more in the beginning. He thinks it was 10 mg twice daily and then it went to 1 tablet a day for the last week at dinner and now it was 15 mg once daily. The two combined were greater to jump start you. It was not a special dose. He then corrected dose to 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily for the starter dose for 2-3 weeks and one tablet daily for the last week of the starter. Then he switched to maintenance dose of 20 mg daily. He did not have a lot or expiration for the previous dose of 15 mg. The lot and expiration for the 20 mg was unknown because he believes the label was covering it. He stated he needed to get his glasses to read bottle. They were reading glasses and he needed prior to getting vaccine. Nothing has changed with his vision. He was hoping to get off of them and has never been on them. He hopes it was not a long term thing. Second dose was given 01Mar2021, Pfizer COVID vaccine, BNT162B2, expiration was unknown. Injected in left upper arm in the muscle (intramuscularly). Second dose administered at 09:20-09:30. He takes blood pressure medication and did not see it was relevant. Takes daily pills for that and rheumatoid arthritis. In the past, he had a few skin cancers. All were prior to getting the vaccine. They were some squamous and basal cell. He has had nothing in quite a while. Nivolumab was helping skin issues. Squamous cell skin cancer was the same family as lung cancer. He did not have a lot or expiration for the nivolumab. He received it by IV infusion. Shortness of breath was mid Feb2021, on and off for a couple of weeks prior to doctor visit on 25Feb2021. He usually does not have much to report and mentioned it. It did not prevent him from doing anything and was not debilitating. One of his fellow golfers said he was huffing and puffing and he just poo pooed it away. He had a flu vaccine in Oct2021 (as reported). No further details provided. Blood clots in right lung morning time, unknown time. Sore left arm at injection site noon - to late in the day of the shot. Shortness of breath - sometimes he feels it in the morning or midday if active. He cannot say a straight time. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office visit required. Vaccination facility type was clinic. Not a military facility. On 25Feb2021, normally scheduled office visit and did the CT scan on 23Feb2021. He went in separate for that. He had the treatment on Thursday. He has another CT scan scheduled in third week of May2021. They were doing it early because of the blood clot. Hopefully, it was gone by then. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks): 1st and 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine as mentioned above. CT scan on 23Feb2021, positive for small blood clot in single vessel in what he thinks was his right lung. All of his previous trouble with the lung cancer was in his right lung. He has never heard of anyone else having blood clots related to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He does not think he has heard of any and wanted to know if there were any. He knows there was something in the press about the (name) vaccine with blood clots. When you do 120 million and have a handful of people, you may have a few things. He did not have any information on the people for (name) to report on. He knows of others who have had the vaccine and no one had any symptoms. No further details provided. The outcome was recovered on 04Feb2021 for the event &#34;sore left arm at injection site&#34;; recovering for the event &#34;shortness of breath&#34;; and unknown for the event &#34;blood clot in right lung&#34;.

He received both Pfizer vaccines. The first one on 28Jan2021 and second one on 18Feb2021. The reporter stated that he believed the first shot was not administered correctly because of the way it was done. He watched them inject the solution and stated that it was supposed to be in the deltoid and if it was not in the muscle and was in the subcutaneous fat it will not be effective, and he did not believe it was effective. He stated that he thinks the first shot may have not been administered correctly and he didn&#39;t think that he had got the effect of the vaccine like it should be. He didn&#39;t have any side effects. He didn&#39;t think the first one was even working because he didn&#39;t think it was administered correctly, he didn&#39;t think it was administered into the muscle and it was administered into the fatty portion of his arm and the shot was administered too quickly. It was way too fast and did not believe they could have put anything in. He received this in (State) and it was administered in a high school where there were no people in there other than the national guard and the people bringing it in and making sure it was mixed and at the right temperature. The person who administered it may not have been well-trained so they may have put it in too fast. He stated the second dose was done nicely. He stated he had no other side effects other than his arm was a little sore where the needle went in. He asked whether he could get a third shot to make up for the first one that did not work. Now he watched people getting the vaccine on TV in other places and they seem to take little bit of time to inject it. This was just like in and out so fast. The second one was great. He asked so, if he get a third shot, is it dangerous or will that be okay. The reporter wanted to know if it is safe if he receives a third dose of the vaccine because he thinks the first one does not count, so it would be like getting 2 doses. He stated he already checked with a medical provider and they don&#39;t have any knowledge of how to use it. He also contacted the CDC. He tried to contact the Chief Medical Officer of Pfizer, but he is no longer the chief medical officer. After a verbal response was provided, he stated he is just going to get the third dose and will tell them if he dies, they should just call us but then said he was kidding. He said he can sign up for the vaccine, it is very easy, he just has to say he is getting his first shot. The reporter stated it is really frustrating to not be able to get studies done on this [a need for a third dose if a first dose is invalid]. He stated, since he couldn&#39;t get any info ourselves, he guess he will have to be the guinea pig. He stated you can always pass this on to the higher ups. He wanted to know if a third dose would be safe to get or if it would potentially kill him. The reporter stated that J&amp;J stopped giving their vaccine because they are having so many people coming down with adverse side effects. They were trying to keep up with Pfizer and Moderna and came out with it too quickly. Limited information was available over the call.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (12Apr2021): New information received from a contactable consumer in response to Non-HCP letter sent to consumer included: Updated the clinical details.

By morning it was fading away and within 24 hours rash was gone with slight lump that gradually faded away over the next 24 hours. There may have been a slight red flushing lower inner surface of the same arm that still seems to be there, but no elevated temperature, tenderness or significant redness compared to the original localized rash. The injection site never reddened but had a slight tenderness for 24-48 hours.

                                                Itchy large welts on back and side of right leg from buttocks to ankle. Took 50 mg of Benadryl and applied Afterbite to leg  immediately.  Most welts subsided within a few hours.  Took another 50 mg of Benadryl Saturday night. Still have a few small areas of redness. Between the time of vaccination and outbreak, I did not eat anything new, no new clothes detergent, no changes.

                                                rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pneumonia, penicillin allergy, diabetec and high blood pressure from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included potassium citrate, tamsulosin, glipizide, magnesium sulfate, (6s)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate glucosamine, mecobalamin, pyridoxal phosphate, thioctic acid (PODIAPN), dulaglutide (TRULICITY), carvedilol, rosuvastatin, furosemide, acetylsalicylic acid (BAYER ASPIRIN) , valsartan, ubidecarenone (COQ-10), fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide, vilanterol trifenatate (TRELEGY ELLIPTA), salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA) and apixaban (ELIQUIS). The patient previously took amoxicillin at 1 DF, 2x/day (one tablet by mouth every 12 hours), azithromycin at 250 mg (250mg, take two tablets by mouth and then one tablet by mouth for four days) and prednisone at 20 mg (20mg, three pills daily for three days then two pills daily for four days). It was reported that the patient had rash toes up to neck. The patient&#39;s wife was wondering if it was normal for his husband to experience rashing after getting the vaccine. The patient had a rash that started from his feet. It looks like sunburn. It is going up his legs, body, and chest. It started the day after the vaccine. Two weeks ago he went to his pulmonary doctor and he had pneumonia. They gave him prednisone, Amoxicillin, and Azithromycin and both are forms of penicillin which he is allergic to. He hasn&#39;t taken it in years. The doctor knew that. She is not sure if the rash if from that. He ended those medications the Friday before the vaccine, 08Jan2021. She is confused. Everyone she calls says they are not sure if it was the medications or the shot. She is trying to get a dermatologist to see the patient. The rash started on 16Jan2021. It has progressively gotten worse. She is wondering if the patient should go back on the fifth for the second vaccine. She is assuming it is the medication. The nurses and doctor don&#39;t know. They said take him to the ER. He is not having trouble breathing. If he was having trouble breathing she would take him to the ER. She can&#39;t get anyone to look at the rash. She didn&#39;t do anything. He is supposed to get the second dose on 05Feb2021. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

No further details provided. Patient stated he had full blood work done about 2 weeks ago (Jan2021) and everything was okay, except a urination problem he has. That was an ongoing issue and again nothing to do with this. He and his wife both had the Covid virus over 3 months ago and he was in the hospital for 9 days and his wife received treatment at home. No further details provided. Patient reported he weighs 250-255 lbs. Outcome of the event was not recovered.  No follow-up activities are needed.

                                                The day after the vaccination ( Monday, 2/14) I was lethargic  when I got up in the morning and by mid afternoon I had a fever of 100 degrees (orally).  I took 2 extra strength tylenol around 4 pm and 2 more when I went to sleep around 10:30 pm. I felt much better when I woke up on Sunday(no lethargy, didn?t feel feverish) but around 2 pm I noticed a red, blotches rash all around my neck, and my upper torso. There?s was also a rash on  the right side of my upper back. I called my PCP but the office was closed for President?s Day. I didn?t feel that the symptoms warranted going to the ER, but I took 2 25mg tabs of Benadryl at 3 pm. It is now 7 pm and the rash on my neck and upper torso looks unchanged but, I also noticed it had spread to the crook of both elbows Otherwise, still feel fine. Body temperature is 98.9 orally, which is slightly higher than my normal temperature, which tends to be around 98 degrees. I  had a similar, but, much more severe reaction to Ibuprofen about 10 years ago, though it started out in similar fashion and got progressively worse over 3 - 4 days. I had to go on a regimen of Prednisone for 2 weeks to bring it under control

                                                I HAD MY FIRST VACCINE ON 6 FEB 2021 AT FACILITY ABOUT 6:00PM.   THAT WAS ON A SATURDAY.  ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY, I HAD A PAIN IN MY LEFT ARM FROM THE INJECTION SITE DOWN THRU MY ELBOW JOINT AND CONTINUING ON TO MY LEFT WRIST.  I HAVE HAD THE PAIN EVER SINCE.  I DID NOT REALIZE THAT TIREDNESS, MUSCLE PAIN, JOINT PAIN AND FEELING UNWELL ALONG WITH DIZZINESS AND WEAKNESS  WERE SYMPTOMS OF A POSSIBLE REACTION TO THE VACCINE. SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS COULD BE FROM A PREVIOUS STROKE.

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL3249, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at 16:30 at a single dose on the left deltoid (reported as &#39;left shoulder&#39;) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks before the COVID-19 vaccine. It was reported that the patient initially had no problem after receiving his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine, but on 23Jan2021 (also reported as 2-1/2 days later), he woke up in the middle of the night, at approximately 3:00am, and the whole back and side of his right leg was covered with very large, itchy welts from his right buttocks down to his right ankle. The patient also had some small itchy areas on the front of his right leg, but no other parts of his body. She said she gave her husband Benadryl 50mg, and put some hydrocortisone cream on his welts, and that seemed to take care of the welts. The reporter told her brother about the welts her husband (patient) developed after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said her brother was questioning if maybe her husband had a delayed reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her brother said her husband&#39;s welts may have been caused by spiked proteins developing from the COVID-19 Vaccine administration. The reporter asked if it is safe for the patient to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, which he is scheduled to receive on 10Feb2021. The patient took 2 Welby generic Benadryl 25mg capsules (lot number: 9DR0738, expiry date: Dec2020) when he first discovered the large, itchy welts on the back and side of his right leg. Then the patient took another 2 Welby generic Benadryl 25mg capsules before he went to bed later that day.  The reporter topically applied the product &#34;After Bite&#34; to the patient&#39;s itchy welts. The reporter clarified that After Bite (lot number: 32812) is not hydrocortisone cream, like she thought, but a Sodium Bicarbonate and Aloe Vera product. The reporter added that the patient&#39;s very large, itchy welts are very faded on the back and side of his right leg, but there remains a couple small spots. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Uneasy sleep, awoke the following morning in a sweat, with overall discomfort and nausea, began to retch and vomit for nearly 13 hrs. throughout the only comfort was to sit in a hot shower till the hot water ran out sometime falling into a deep sleep, I did this many times through the day, Accompanying this was a general fog and complete loss of equilibrium, extreme weakness. this made it difficult to move from bed to bath or anywhere in my home. I am writing this at 5:13 am Mar  6 and find it hard to gather thoughts.

                                                I got my 1st Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination on 3/4/2021. No real adverse effects immediately - just a little sore right arm at the injection site and a watery, runny nose a day or so later that eventually stopped. I have allergies so I&#39;m used to the runny nose symptom. However, on Monday evening, March 15, I noticed some slight pain where my lymph nodes are located underneath my jaw and close to my ear on the right side. There was a small lump that was tender to the touch, about the size of a small raisin or grape, under my jaw along my neck on the right side. To a much lesser extent, and barely noticeable, in a similar location, on my left side as well. I went to my primary care physician the next day, 3/16, who confirmed that I had swollen lymph nodes - and also told me they could notice them further down my neck as well, which I was not aware of previously. I had no other symptoms, e.g., no temperature, etc. They said that, yes, the swollen lymph nodes appeared to be consistent with earlier reports of swollen lymph nodes as a resulting side effect in some patients following a Covid19 vaccination, but also mentioned that often, this side effect was more noticeable several days after the vaccination. Since my swollen lymph nodes occurred nearly 10 days later, my PCP team said to go ahead and get the 2nd Pfizer vaccination as scheduled 3/25/21, but to return to their office two weeks later for another checkup to make sure there weren&#39;t any other issues going on.

A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 07Mar2021 at 14:45 (02:45 pm) at the age of 73-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at the facility. The patient did not receive other vaccines on the same date. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and Sweet&#39;s Syndrome. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate (AMLODIPINE), lenalidomide (REVLIMID), prednisone, danazol, and clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX); all taken for unspecified indications, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6201) on 14Mar2021 (as reported; pending clarification) at 02:45 pm at the left arm for COVID-19 Immunization. The patient also previously took levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) and valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX) and experienced allergies with both drugs. The patient reported that as a person with MDS and Sweet&#39;s Syndrome, he has had a history of experiencing major skin outbreaks but it has been under control for over a year with oral meds. Two days after his 2nd injection he experienced a major Sweet&#39;s Syndrome skin outbreak. Apparently, the vaccine reacted with his autoimmune system to trigger a reaction. The injection area was red about the size of a softball with large swollen, red, erythema migrants rash on chest, left arm, with smaller lesions on his neck, face &amp; back. Once the symptoms appeared, the outbreak followed its normal course of action. It took about 5 days to reach its apex; thereafter the symptoms began to slowly subside. He is now into day 9 and have light rashes. By day 12 he expects all traces of the rash to be completely gone. Patient&#39;s assessment: he was not allergic to the vaccine but the vaccine set off his immune system. If/when the rash took longer than the normal 6 days to reach its apex, he was prepared to significantly increase his Prednisone. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and post vaccination. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The onset of events was on 09Mar2021 at 21:00 (09:00 pm) with outcome of recovering.

                                                Spinal meningitis; Shingles; severe pounding headaches; migraine; pain in his back; wobbly, very off balance; dizziness; stomach pain; stomach felt hard; has not had a correct bowel movement since then; ringing in his ears; hearing loss; drive his blood pressure up/his blood pressure goes up; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (patient and wife). A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), dose 1 intramuscular on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 vaccination; adalimumab (HUMIRA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1132646) to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose, subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1136949) to Mar2021, at unspecified dose for moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.  The patient medical history includes ear infection. Concomitant medications were not reported. On unknown dates, the patient experienced tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles and whole left side of face and eye swollen. In 2021, the patient experienced infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy and whole left side of face and eye swollen. On 02Mar2021, the patient experienced felt weakness and chills. On 08Apr2021, the patient experienced substantial bubble of pus under arm. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit. In Apr2021, the substantial bubble of pus under arm resolved. On unknown dates, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears and whole left side of face and eye swollen resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. In Feb2021, the patient saw his physician twice for an ear infection. On 01Mar2021, the patient got his first vaccine shot. The next day he had chills and fever and feeling of weakness the next day. He went away after a short time and he felts better. He went to the physician twice in the past two weeks for minor infections especially in his ears. The tissue inside his ear dried up and bleeding. On the first visit he had a fever due to the infection in the ear. His physician prescribed antibiotic for a week. He got another infection in the same ears. He was painful when touched it. He went back to physician and physician prescribed another anitbiotic. The physician said the infections were to be expected with Humira because Humira weakens immune system. Partly because of his age. His age may be a contributing factor as well. He agrees to have physician contacted. On 29Mar2021 to 1Apr2021, he was in the hospital his infection started in his ear lobe that migrated to his whole left side of his face. His eye was swollen and felt pain on top of his head. His Temp of 105 when he went in. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics. He was tested to make sure infection had not spread to blood or bones. The Humira might have played a role because it lowers the bodies resistance to infection. They asked him not to take the Humira for two Saturdays. He did not take Humira on 09Apr2021 or before. He was stable. His skin was cracking up. Thought it might be shingles. He was prescribed an oral antibiotic first time, but then a week and a half later, it acted up again and he went back and got a different antibiotic and that worked until it. He was feeling completely better since he got out of the hospital. He had more energy than he had in a while. He had been feeling low energy for a while due to the infection. His physician did not think he should stop taking Humira but if he got a fever he needs to investigate immediately to see if he needs to hospitalized. In 08Apr2021, he had substantial bubble of puss under his arm. He gave him a steroid injection to control that. On 10Apr2021, he had thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of his armpit and he thinks that was the end of it. On 11Apr2021, he had his second Covid vaccine manufactured by Moderna then after he was released from the hospital. He was no issues or reactions with either injection. He was careful when he went out around people. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. The action taken in response to the events adalimumab was not applicable. The outcome of event infection in ear lobe, eye swelling and swelling face recovered in 2021, weakness and chills and fever recovered in Mar2021, ear infection and pain localised recovered on unspecified date, Axillary abscess/substantial bubble of puss under arm recovered in Apr2021; event ear bleeding was recovering; event fluid discharge, skin fissures and shingles was unknown.  The reporter&#39;s causality for adalimumab (Humira) on the events infection in ear lobe, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset with Humira (Adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of felt weakness and chills with Humira (Adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, skin was cracking up and possible shingles was not provided.  Opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab). Opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of felt weakness, chills, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset and tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pfizer comment: The serious events Ear lobe infection and Condition aggravated were considered as unlikely related to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of BNT162b2 cannot be completely excluded for the non-serious asthenia, pyrexia and chills, which occurred in a close temporal relation, namely, one day after the  first dose BNT162B2 injection. The other reported events were confirmed as non-serious, while the causality was confounded by ADALIMUMAB administration. The infectious events were to be expected with co-suspect due an immunosuppression activity with increased infection susceptibility, such as Herpes zoster and Ear lobe infection aggravated, in this case. Furthermore, swelling face and eye swollen with unknown onset in 2021 may be attributable to the co-suspect and unrelated to the vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

                                                Per secure message sent by patient on 2/4/2021: &#34;I received my Covid shot at the clinic on January 28th. Yesterday, February 2nd, in  the late afternoon I became very red and itchy and my tongue swelled. I went to  the emergency room where they gave me sodium chloride, Benadryl,  Pepcid and 2 &#34;epi&#34; shots. After about 4 hours I was sent home. Could that have  been a reaction to my Covid vaccine? Today I am tired but fine and swelling is  gone. I had told the person who scheduled my first shot and the person who  vaccinated me that I was taking Skyrizi injections for psoriasis and had my  last injection of Skyrizi on Dec 15.&#34;

A 74-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021 at first single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included: the patient had pre-existing conditions, he was hospitalized in Dec2020 and he was undergoing a lot of testing and there was possibility that he had a form of cancer and they discovered something on the next to his lungs. The reporter stated they did not have all of the diagnosis of it yet and he was waiting to be seen for specialist. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 20Jan2021, the patient had a swelling. Swelling in the groin area above the hip. Skin is swollen and there is a lump. The reporter was trying to find out with the list of side effects if the lymph glands can swell and what areas of the body would you may be see swelling in the lymph nodes. The reporter wonder if there be lymph gland located for the men or the lymph gland located on the either side of the reproductive organ, in that area. What had happened to the patient, they were not sure if that was a side effect. One of the side effects the reporter knew it was listed on the website was lymph glands swell up. So the reporter just trying to find out if there were lymph glands in that same area where the patient was experience swelling right now. He did not have this issue before he got the vaccine, so it just sort of seemed this is. The reporter talked to the physician&#39;s office briefly when this happened just to see did they need to bring the patient in immediately for an appointment to check if it&#39;s (incomplete sentence). So far the patient just received topical ice packs over the area for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

The consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot no. E10142, via an unspecified route of administration (administered to the left arm) on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for Covid vaccination administered at facility. Medical history included 100% disabled, Covid from Jul2020, hospitalized from 21Jul2020 to 26Jul2020, blood plasma, and sore. No relevant family medical history relevant to AEs. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient previously took remdesivir. The patient called to report side effects after getting the first Pfizer COVID vaccination. He got it on 19Jan2021. He had COVID before. Last summer he hadn&#39;t left the house for 20 plus weeks and their son who was living with them brought the COVID virus in to them. His son and wife were asymptomatic and suffered at the house and he was completely disabled, with underlying conditions had to drag himself to the facility. He eventually had to be hospitalized on 21Jul2020. He had blood plasma and remdesivir and stayed in the hospital from Tuesday through Sunday. After getting the treatment, he felt like superman. On 20Jan2021, he next day, about 24 hours later he started feeling sick again, he felt like when he had COVID back in Jul2020. It lasted for 24 hours, terrible headache, chills, aches, and a little diarrhea. He said after he got the vaccine, 24 hours later, his arm got sorer and sorer. He had 99.9 F fever and a terrible headache. He also put on a little weight on an unspecified date. No emergency room visit. No relevant tests. He called the facility the next morning and they told him to rest. He slept all day and the next day he felt like superman again. He called the facility that Thursday morning and they instructed him to relax and that it seemed to affect people who have had the COVID virus before, they have that reaction, and it should subside and it did. He stated his side effects were about 20% of what they were when he actually had COVID. The clinic told him that if he had any reaction to call and that Thursday he just relaxed. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. Never had any problems with shots, not really. He remembered when he went to specific area they gave him a whole bunch of shots with these guns and he was just sore a couple days, but that was it, no big deal. The patient underwent lab test which included COVID-19 positive Jul2020. The outcome of feeling sick, headache, chills, ache, diarrhea was recovering while outcome of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021107344 Same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

My shoulder where the shot occurred became painful and a pinkish rash formed there.  The temp rose to 3.5 degrees over the next seven hours and remained that high until mid morning Saturday.

The rash disappeared on Monday and the shoulder pain stopped on Tuesday.

                                                They made me wait 20 mins to make  sure I didn&#39;t have a reaction, went home and was fine.  A couple days later I started itching and the next Monday it was worse. I woke up  the next morning with a rash on my face, right arm, head, all over my chest moving to my legs.  It just got worse and hurt so bad, so i went to the ER right away. They put me on IV pecid and Benadryl, that didn&#39;t help. They put me on a steroid IV, tat really calmed the itching down. I was in the ER about 2 hours and then they sent me home.  They sent me home with steroid and hydroxyzine HCL -10mg  1/3x days.  It took about a week and a half for the rash to go away. I still have some itching but not a problem.

                                                his legs were extremely weak; has to hold onto something to go through the house; rash is across his upper back, chest, and down both arms; Patient had a dry cough; running a fever; the next morning and it was even worse; flu-like symptoms after both doses; Sore all Over/Achy all over; This is a spontaneous report based on information received by Pfizer from Biontech [manufacturer control number: 40968], license party for Comirnaty. A contactable consumer reported that a 74-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162b2(COMIRNATY, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207, Expiration: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 19Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history includes Arthritis (arthritis is in his right foot only and his big toe, diagnosed in 2017 or 2018) and Concomitant medication were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY) on 26Feb2021 for Covid-19 immunisation and Unspecified steroid shot. Stated reaction was three to four days. First shot got caller and patient down for a week. Second shot got caller down for three days. At first, patient&#39;s reaction was running like hers. Patient had a dry cough on an unspecified date in 2021. Was going for a COVID test today. Last week patient started running a fever on an unspecified date in 2021 and his legs were extremely weak on 14Apr2021. Has to hold onto something to go through the house on 14Apr2021. He was moving a little better, but not much. Patient had to go to doctor for his foot. Has terrible arthritis in the big toe on his right foot. Gets steroid shot every three months. Three weeks and four days after second COVID shot everything seemed to have worn off. The PA put the shot in his foot and it bruised the patient. Patient still has bruises on an unspecified date in 2021. Got the steroid shot in his big toe and two days later the weakness hit a second time. It really wiped him out. Caller cannot help patient get up and down. Patient was struggling with his legs and was aching. Wants to know if a steroid shot on top of the COVID shot and that close after would cause another reaction? The PA said it was ok to get a steroid shot three weeks after. Patient started having these reactions and doesn&#39;t know if it was the COVID shot. Has had steroid shots every 3 months for 4 years. Has never had this kind of reaction. Patient didn&#39;t think about getting the steroid shot because he seemed to be feeling fine. Reaction started the next morning and it was even worse on an unspecified date in 2021. By the third day after the shot he was down and caller couldn&#39;t help patient get up. It scared the caller. Patient also broke out in a rash across his shoulders and down both arms. States her husband has had both shots and he has been having issues since the second one n 19MAR2021. Reporter states 3 weeks and 4 days after the second vaccine, her husband had to have a steroid shot in his foot because he has terrible arthritis in his right foot. Reporter states the patient has had a flare up since then with weakness in his legs and a rash on his chest. States the only difference this time is that he had just had the second Covid vaccine 3 weeks prior. States he has not had steroid reactions in the past, and she feels like this reaction was because of the Covid vaccine. Clarifies the shot in his foot was on 13Apr2021 and she does not know what steroid was injected. States it was 3weeks and 4 days between the steroid injection and the vaccine. States maybe they should war people not to get a steroid shot for a longer time after the vaccine. States after the first vaccine for about 5 days they were just laid out. States they ate soup and whatever they could warm up in the microwave. States his ear doctor said if they reacted to the first shot they must have had Covid at sometimes. States she doesn&#39;t know, they never got tested before but they didn&#39;t have any symptoms. States her husband&#39;s test yesterday was negative. Weakness in the Legs AE: States for the last 2 days, he could not even get up on his own and she can&#39;t lift him because he was bigger than she was. Rash was states it was not itching or anything, just a rash. States it was odd because she has had hives, and this was just broken out. Clarifies the rash was across his upper back, chest, and down both arms on 14Apr2021. States it was kind of like speckled on his body like the measles on an unspecified date in 2021. States the patient was 74 years old and he had measles when he was a kid just like she did, so it is not the measles. States the patient had a Covid 19 test done yesterday and it came back negative, so he doesn&#39;t have Covid. She doesn&#39;t know what it was. Treatment: states he was taking Motrin for the Aching. States she does not know if the reaction was because the PA did the injection, it had always been the doctor that had given the injection. Caller states she thinks it was getting the steroid injection on top of receiving the Covid shot. States the both received their vaccines because they couldn&#39;t get a shot because they weren&#39;t giving shots at her age, so when offered them the vaccine, they jumped on it. Yes, last Monday to his Nurse Practitioner, did not address the weakness in his legs because did not know what to do for that. She did not even say what she thought it was, said he needed to see someone about that but does not know who to see, does not know whether to go to the ER or who to go to. Not that emergent but when doctor does not know what to treat with worrisome. She was calling about to finish the report and to speak with the Medical department regarding if this has been reported before or if any information on the Covid vaccine and steroid injections. He received the 1st dose on 26Feb2021 and the 2nd dose on 19Mar2021. She mentioned that both of them experienced achiness, sore all over after the 1st dose and flu-like symptoms on an unspecified date in 2021 after both doses. Her husband however, had muscle weakness on his legs after the 2nd dose. On 13Apr2021, about 3 weeks and 4 days after the 2nd dose, her husband received a steroid shot on his right foot. They noticed that the weakness on his legs became extreme, to which he had trouble standing up and has to hold on to something to stand up as he cannot support himself. He also had a rash on his trunk, back, and down his arms. She mentioned that the rash was not itchy but was speckled like measles. They were wondering if this has been reported and if it was possibly an interaction between the vaccine and steroid. They mentioned that they already consulted with their HCP but said that they really cannot tell. Outcome of his legs were extremely weak, has to hold onto something to go through the house was not recovered while with other event rash is across his upper back, chest, and down both arms, Achy all over was recovered on 22Mar2021 and flu-like symptoms after both doses and Sore all Over was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021, while with other events was unknown.  Follow up attempts were needed. Further information is expected.

By 3:00 p.m. That day he had soreness at the injection site and by 10:00 p.m. he noticed difficulty using his arms to the transfer.  There was particular difficulty with the proximal left upper extremity and bracing himself and he fell to the floor.  He feels that both arms are weaker since the injection.  He had some pain in the arms particularly at the injection site initially but that has resolved.  He had dry mouth up until February 2nd.  By February 2nd he could start to transfer a bit better from a chair to his driver seat in the van.  He is still not back to his baseline function.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 75 years, on 21Jan2021 10:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient said he had red hives develop on Saturday, 23Jan2021. He went to an Urgent Care for treatment. He said the doctor at the Urgent Care looked at his hives, and told him the hives were likely related to the COVID-19 Vaccine, but the doctor was not positive of that. The patient said he hadn&#39;t had any recent changes in his health, or issues before he received the COVID-19 Vaccine, so that was why the doctor thought the hives were from the COVID-19 Vaccine. He clarified he has hives from his knee to his chest, and from his chest to his arm and to his neck area. He clarified the hives have been moving around his body. He said the hives had little red bumps, saying the hives were itchy. Therapeutic measures (Zyrtec and Hydrocortisone Cream) were taken as a result of hives from his knee to his chest, and from his chest to his arm and to his neck area, hives had little red bumps and were itchy (urticaria). The outcome of the event was recovering.

This is now accompanied by an area of numbness in the same area. The pain symptoms are aggravated by extension of the arm. These symptoms have persisted for the past week or so. I don?t know if they will be permanent.  I believe this was caused by injection into a peripheral nerve by injecting too distally into the deltoid.  My suggestion is to review proper injection techniques (e.g. location) to all who are giving injections.

It has been 17 days since receiving the second dose and the rash has not gone away although it is a bit less red. I&#39;ve had no ill effects from the rash.

                                                On March 15 I started experiencing pain in both hips as I was walking.  This pain continued and a few days later I started to experience pain in my lower back in addition to the pain in my hips.  It was very hard to walk and if I went too far or long I had to stop and wait for the pain to lessen.  The pain had lessened but is still present.  on about March 20/21 I noticed a blister on the index finger of my right hand.  A rash showed up on my left arm in the area of my wrist on March 23.  It is now March 25 and the rash all over my whole body.  It itches and at times is painful.
