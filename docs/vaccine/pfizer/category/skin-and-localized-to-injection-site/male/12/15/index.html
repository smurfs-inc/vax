Mom called on 05/17/2021 and informed that patient developed rash on inner thigh on the morning of 05/17/2021 .He was fine all day on 05/16/2021 and woke up with a rash in his inner thigh. Mom gave him Bendryl but he called mom again after few hours with a rash on his hand. Mom took the child to urgent care in the afternoon and the doctor was confused as to why he got a rash after more than 12 hours later. The doctor was not sure if it was due to the vaccine. The doctor advised Benadryl and gave a prescription of prednisone to keep on hand incase symptoms worsen.

We did that for a week and it started to go away. I outlined the rash with sharpie  - t did get bigger and started spreading down his shoulders.

                                                Patient started to develop a cough on the second day of the vaccine around 6 pm. The cough was accompanied by shortness of breath, given his asthma we assumed this was some asthma related reaction to the vaccine. Nonetheless, that evening he started to complain about chest pain every time he laid back on his bed. This symptom is not common in previous asthma attacks. Sitting up alleviated the symptom, chest pain and shortness of breath lasted for 2 nights (Sunday and Monday evening), by Tuesday he felt better. We assumed this was an asthma episode, but recent reports of Myocarditis leads us to believe the had a mild myocarditis episode, given the chest pain while lying down.  He also had typical COVID vaccine symptoms such as low grade fever (100F), pain in the vaccination site, congestion, and itchy throat.

Start date is approximate but she thought it was within a week of the first vaccine dose. Patient developed an itchy rash on his buttocks and waist. Mom described the rash as small pinpoints. She thinks it lasted 1-2 weeks. Treated with OTC hydrocortisone, no medical care. Rash was fully resolved when patient received his second Pfizer dose on 6/10/21 and he has not developed a similar rash; advised family to call back if he experiences the reaction again.

Highest recorded temp was 102.2 at approx. 30 hours after shot.   Fatigue interfered with daily activities from 12 hours after shot to 36 hours after shot.  Mild soreness in arm where shot was given.   Pulse and blood oxygen were checked each time temp was taken (approx 3 times between 24 and 36 hours after shot) and were within normal ranges each time; although pulse was on the higher end of the normal range for a 12 year old boy.  Quick recover starting 36 hours after shot, when temp reduced to approx. 100.  Appetite returned at this time.  Fever was gone by 48 hours after shot and all other side effect seemed to have subsided by this point.  No mediation was taken by the vaccine recipient.  Vaccine recipient was offered usual foods and he consumed milk and water in smaller amounts than usual but also more frequently than usual to stay hydrated.

                                                My child began feeling tired and ran a temperature about a degree warmer than usual for the first three days after his second COVID vaccine on Sunday 13 June. (So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). Thursday he was extra tired and began to complain of itching under the chin in the evening. Friday morning he woke up and had what he described as itchy/painful raised, red patches of skin on his right collarbone, under his chin, across his face (right cheek, temple). His temperature was about 100* and he was, quite frankly, pretty miserable. These weren&#39;t little skin irritations, they were giant patches of inflamed tissue covering the better part of each cheek, his temple, under the chin and then in smaller spots on his collarbones and back. Saturday the rash moved to cover the left side of his face, and the left collarbone. (And no, for the record, I did not switch laundry detergents, change his diet or anything like that.) As of today, 6/21 condition has improved but not fully resolved.

                                                Allergic rash all over his body; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable nurse (Parent). A 12-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection, Lot Number: EW0191), via intramuscular route of administration on 18Jun2021 at 19:00 (at the age of 12-year-old), as dose 1, single in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 21Jun2021, 2 days and 5 hours after the administration of first dose of vaccine, the patient experienced allergic rash all over body. The patient received vaccine on 18Jun2021, Friday and on 21Jun2021 night, he began to have rash, like an allergic rash all over the body. Patient never had this before and the reporter did not know if it was related to vaccine. Patient was taken to doctor at the urgent care, where he was prescribed with Prednisone 20 mg 1 tablet by mouth daily for 3 days and Benadryl 25 milligrams. Reporter attributed the events to vaccine because that was the only thing that was different since the rash broke out. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of allergic rash all over body and no lab works were performed. Patient was due for his second dose on 09Jul2021. The clinical outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile and close temporal association, the event of allergic rash is assessed as related to the product BNT162B2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

On July 5th 2021 he woke up with a sore throat and not feeling well, on that night he had a 102&#43; fever, congested and ill. This continued and on Tuesday morning when he woke up, nose red and could not breath out of it. The fever broke on Thursday and he had been treated with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, fluids, Flonase and rest. I tried to help him with steam, to steam out so he could breath better. We did a rapid Covid test on the 6th of July which was negative. On the 9th and 10th he was still tired and had congestion, but on late on the 8th of July the fever did break. He was just miserable, he slept most of that week. He did not have body aches, so I don&#39;t think that he had the flu.

                                                tiredness; weakness; head is burning; fatigue; drooling; hives; itching; redness; gained weight since the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 12-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8729; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm on 27May2021 (at the age of 12-years-old) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included patient had an allergic reaction to penicillin before. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a meningitis vaccine a month before the covid vaccine. Patient&#39;s mother was calling on behalf of her 12 year old son. She stated her son received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 27May2021. On 27May2021,6 hours after receiving the vaccine the patient said he was very itchy and had hives on the left side of his chest. At first she thought the patient had poison ivy because it was like 3-4 inches across. The next day the patient said he was itchy when he sat up and it went up onto his neck and cheeks and that&#39;s when she realized it was hives. She called the doctor, applied cold compresses to the patient and gave him Benadryl. The hives resolved very quickly, the patient has never had hives or an allergic reaction before. By 2:30 the patient had the Benadryl and you couldn&#39;t see the red anymore. The patient could sit up but kept saying it itched and that went on for about 48 hours. You would have to look pretty closely to see the bumps. One week after the patient received the vaccine he was really weak and tired (on 03Jun2021). She stated her son also keeps having episodes of tiredness and weakness. It felt like the patient had been exercising and his legs were tired and his head felt like it was burning (on 03Jun2021). The patient&#39;s temperature was 97.7. The patient laid down and he slept pretty hard, and was drooling, for a couple of hours. When the patient woke up he didn&#39;t know where he was, the time or date and within a couple of hours the patient was fine. She didn&#39;t think anything of it the first time it happened. This event happened again 2 weeks after the vaccine. The doctor said they symptoms sound like mono but the patient&#39;s lymph nodes aren&#39;t swollen and he doesn&#39;t have a sore throat. The doctor thought the patient was having a delayed immune response to the vaccine because of the timing of it. The doctor said that by 3 weeks this should have resolved. The patient has had 2 mild episodes of this since, but he didn&#39;t go to sleep he just laid down. The doctor said to wait to get the second dose, so now it is 4 weeks since the first vaccine. The patient was at the 30th percentile for his height and average for his weight. The patient had gained weight since the vaccine but his mother didn&#39;t know if that was related to the vaccine. She was afraid of the patient having myocarditis with the second dose. The patient went to sleep after taking the Benadryl last time and she was afraid that the patient won&#39;t be able to tell her if he was having chest pain or problems breathing. She stated if his reaction was just hives she would give him Benadryl but with the risk of myocarditis after being given Benadryl he wouldn&#39;t be alert enough to tell her if something was going on with his heart due to him having fatigue as well already. The redness went away within 24 hours and the itching was gone in 48-72 hours. The redness was gone the evening of the 28th. The patient could still see and feel the bumps, the bumps were just white. The patient&#39;s head was burning happened the first 2 times he had these events. The patient&#39;s temperature was 97.7 and 98.1 fahrenheit when this happened. The other two times the patient said his head burned between his eyes and not like a headache. The doctor said that if the fatigue symptom continued he would recommend doing some blood work but since it has gotten better his mother may take him to an allergist. She thinks that the patient may be allergic to something in the vaccine. she was thinking of taking him to an allergist to see if he was allergic to one of the ingredients in the vaccine. She stated from the list of the ingredients the only ingredient she found that could be linked to the vaccine that could cause an allergic reaction would be PEG. She stated her son never had any allergies to medications or vaccines in the past. She stated she was not sure what advice should be given regarding her son receiving the second dose of the vaccine due to him having an allergic reaction to the first dose and tiredness and weakness. She stated she was not sure of the risks of vaccine versus him not being vaccinated. She would like to know if he should receive the second dose after experiencing side effects with the first dose. Reporter seriousness events was unspecified. Outcome of the events hives and itching recovered on May 2021, redness recovered on 28May2021, event tiredness and weakness was recovering and for other events was unknown.

Morning of 7/16/21, he woke with a significantly swollen arm with raised red area and extreme sensitivity.  I took pictures due to the significance.  Measurements 3&#34; x 3&#34;, warm to the touch.  Color, dark purple.   By Day 3  -  7/18/21, the color faded to a blue bruise, size remains the same, still warm to the touch.  Day 4 - 7/19/21, color is fading, but can still see the area affected on his right harm.    Since it has been 4  days, we went back to pharmacy today 7/19/21 at 1:00 pm, to show them his arm, and the pictures I took.  They referred to this as COVID arm, and immediately recommended I register with VSAFE to track his progress.   *Note:  VSAFE does not allow any registration for people born after 2005.    So, I am tracking information here at VAERS

Had him sit, take off his mask, gave him water to sip, took BP (102/60), within 5 minutes he started to come back around, was able to follow command (wiggle fingers) vocalize that he could breathe fine, and felt that there was water behind his ears. His temperature to touch seemed to start to go back down, and once paramedics arrived they evaluated him and released him as &#34;ok&#34; within 10 minutes.

Have seen the pediatric and after examination, she mentioned that it could be Pityriasis Rosea  and advised to see a dermatologist and also report this event.  I am reporting this as advised by the pediatrician.  Not sure if this is the side effect of vaccine but believe it could be because this started after 24hrs of receiving vaccine.

Nothing concerning but right before he went to bed he didn&#39;t feel good. My son thought he had to vomit but couldn&#39;t. He said his HEARTBEAT WAS SO MUCH FASTER than normal. I got so concerned that I slept next to him which I never did before. He fell asleep after 1 h and woke up the next morning and felt fine. I did not go to the doctor because he was feeling well the next day.

                                                His mother was present and told us he had multiple allergies to foods and sulfites, as well as asthma. He used to carry an epi pen but does not currently, also has a history of asthma for which he carries a rescue inhaler. He received the Pfizer vaccine at approximately 9:15am in his left deltoid, and about 2 minutes later Mom notified me and the school nurse that he was starting to get &#34;hives&#34;. I noted a localized, small area of erythema on his left upper arm around the bandaid, approximately silver dollar sized, not raised. School RN removed the bandaid. He did not complain of itching and at that time stated he felt like he was breathing fine. The school RN gave him 50mg of Benadryl PO per the mom&#39;s request at 0920. The patient was in no distress, breathing and speaking normally. At 0922 he stated he felt like his throat and tongue were swelling, so I had him remove his mask, and asked mom if his lips looked swollen to which she responded &#34;yes&#34;. He stated it felt like it was hard to swallow. We placed a pulse ox on the patient and his oxygen saturations were 96-100%, HR 85-90, RR 30. We administered an adult epi pen (0.3mg of epinephrine) into his left lateral thigh at 0923 and had the school office call EMS. The patient remained in no acute distress, and said the swelling in his tongue felt better after the epi, but that his throat still felt swollen. Lungs clear bilaterally, RR remained 24-30, HR 110-115, pulse ox 98-100%, erythema on left upper arm resolved. Fire department arrived at 0935- report given and they checked a pulse ox as well. Patient walked to parking lot to ambulance for transfer to Hospital with mother following behind.

Felt tired that night and into the next day with some local swelling and pain to the right arm at site of injection, and also into right armpit. Thursday evening, he was resting sitting on the couch and developed some mild chest pain. Can&#39;t really describe the location or severity very well. Did seem to be worse with inspiration. Hasn&#39;t reoccurred since that time. Still feels somewhat tired today with mildly sore right arm. No fevers. No chest pain today.    IR showed second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was given to the left arm but confirmed with CVS that it was given to the right arm.

                                                Fever - up to 102 - lasted until yesterday - it was back down to normal yesterday. He has had a sore arm - at injection site; the arm also was hard - a lump that was a little bit  palpable  - which is gone now; - body aches - gone now, chills, difficulty swallowing. He didn&#39;t have trouble breathing, but he felt his throat tighten when he swallowed (still has this); upper right abdominal pain - that is the real bad symptom still. His eyes hurt when he moved them around. Fatigue. He&#39;s been glued to the couch since Friday. I had given Advil and Tylenol. After the prolonged fever, I eventually called into the doctor&#39;s office. The pediatrician said it was common and said to wait it out but seek treatment if it got worse. He is able to eat but is awful nauseous. He is eating what sounds good. The pain stays the same when he eats.

A 13-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0164, expiration date: 31Aug2021), at the age of 13 years old, in left arm on 14May2021 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was a normal 13 years old, he doesn&#39;t take anything, he&#39;s active. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The vaccines administered on same date with BNT162B2 was none. The previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient previously received the flu shot every year and experienced no adverse event. On 16May2021, about 48 hours after the vaccination, the patient started having stomach pain in the middle of the night. It began 16May2021 in the evening and into 17May2021, the patient was having stomach pain and not feeling well. Reporter stated the patient woke her up. Reporter stated they thought it was some food he ate. Reporter stated they tested his covid antibodies and they also personally at home on 17May2021 night, they tested him with a home kit for covid just to double check because nobody really brought it up and it was negative also. Reporter confirmed the home covid test was done on 17May2021. Reporter stated there was no known exposure, they just did it to make sure he didn&#39;t have covid. The patient was taken to the emergency room on 18May2021. Reporter stated they were waiting because patient felt good during the day and they thought nothing was wrong, but then the extreme stomach pain started again and so on 18May2021, she took him to the local emergency room. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t do much other than push on his stomach, she was worried about appendicitis. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t worry too much, but she thought maybe it was his appendix. The doctor examined him and said he had a stomach issue and released him with medicine and that was the 18May2021. On 19May2021 and 20May2021, the patient would get intermittent stomach pain, again thinking it was a stomach bug or something. On 20May2021, the patient experienced petechial rash on his legs. Reporter called the pediatrician and again the patient was having intermittent stomach pain and kept having it intermittently. The patient would feel fine then feel sick again then on the 22May2021, the patient had more bad stomach pain and some vomiting so he wound up back in the emergency department, it was a different one than the first on 22May2021. The patient did a lot of blood work, his labs came back good, but he did not do a CAT scan, but reporter tried to do everything else, tested patient for covid, antibodies and everything and they sent him home again on the 22May2021. The patient had intermittent pain again throughout 23May2021 then on 24May2021, he went to visit the pediatrician just for a visit and they were thinking its Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) which is an autoimmune response and they still didn&#39;t have a diagnosis for his stomach. Reporter stated patient was perfectly fine at the pediatrician, then when they got home, he started having lower left abdominal pain and he doubled over in pain and started vomiting. The patient vomited about three times in total, it wasn&#39;t like excessive vomiting. Reporter stated the pain would bring it on, he does have a rash, which is still getting a little bit worse. Reporter stated they took him back to the emergency room, they did a CAT scan and that showed he had inflammation in his intestines and his stomach so they kept him in the hospital. The patient was admitted on 24May2021 when he visited the emergency room for the third time. Reporter stated because patient was in pain, they admitted him to watch him. Reporter stated they were worried about the patient having intussusception with the bowel, where his bowel can go inside each other and can create a blockage, so they wanted to admit him to make sure that didn&#39;t happen. Reporter stated the worst of the stomach pain was on 25May2021, which would have been at 19:00. The patient had not had an episode since then, he hadn&#39;t had an attack like that since. The whole week before from 17May2021, or the 16May2021 when it started through 25May2021, it was very intermittent of a lot of pain. So far, knock on wood, the patient hadn&#39;t had it since 25May2021 at 19:00 and hopefully tonight it won&#39;t happen. Reporter stated it will be about 48 hours of not having the bad pain. Reporter stated he still has some pain, but not like where she had to rush him to the emergency room. The patient&#39;s vomiting ended on 24May2021 or 25May2021. He had recovered completely from vomiting so far. The patient was released on 26May2021 with a diagnosis of HSP, which was an auto immune response, and he&#39;d never had this happen before. Reporter stated if she googled HSP, it said it can still get worse, but it was not the worst case of HSP. Reporter stated the patient has never had anything like this before, he was perfectly fine, they made it through covid and didn&#39;t get covid and he is a healthy kid so she thought Pfizer should know. The outcome of the events HSP, stomach pain, petechial rash was not recovered. The outcome of vomiting was recovered on 24May2021 or 25May2021. The outcome of the events inflammation in intestines and stomach, didn&#39;t feel well/feel sick, intermittent pain and lower left abdominal pain was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Around that time patient&#39;s parents came back up to pharmacy to notify staff that he had broken out into a rash in the back and his hands felt swollen.  I asked if he had any trouble breathing and parents stated no.  We followed the Adverse Event Action Plan.  We called 911.  Patient&#39;s parents then stated son is starting to have some breathing issue.  I came out with EpiPen and was going to administer when mom stated son&#39;s symptoms has resolved greatly and she did not want me to administer EpiPen.  Shortly after EMS arrived and evaluated patient and took him to hospital for observation.

                                                Patient was examined by his pediatrician and cleared for physical exercise on 06/01/2021; 4 days before receiving his 1st COVID19 shot on 06/05/2021. On 06/07/2021 we dropped patient off at Soccer Camp. At 10am he started basic soccer ball control drills, which did not include rigorous exercise. At 10:30am we received a call from him, asking for us to pick him up as he had almost blacked out a few times.  We arrived at the sports field at 10:40am. I found patient to be red faced, sweaty, but cohesive. He described the following symptoms occurred during mild exercise: difficulty breathing, thirsty, fast heartbeat, &#34;black things&#34; over eyes, preventing clear vision, difficulty focusing, difficulty hearing, feeling faint  He took a water break and used his pro-air inhaler, as he thought he might have been having his 1st asthma attack (he&#39;s only ever presented with slight wheezing or night time cough). After a short break, his symptoms subsided, so he re-joined the group. After one more soccer drill, the symptoms came back again, but this time he experienced very hard palpitations and the feeling that his shoes were squeezing his feet. At that point he asked for permission to call to us and have us collect him.  We took him home and monitored him for a while. He seemed calm and symptom free. I had him shower and he was fine for the rest of the day.  The following day I had him jog on our treadmill for a period. He was symptom free. I increased inclination on the treadmill and he handled it ok without any of the previous symptoms. However, now realizing that he was within the 3 day window of his COVID shot, I decided not take him back to the soccer camp.   As of 06/13/2021 he has not complained of any symptoms returning. That said, he also has not performed any significant outdoor exercise since then either, besides walking.

                                                During the night that he got the vaccine my son woke up with hives and I gave him some Benadryl. I gave him his rescue inhaler in the afternoon. He has not used his inhaler for over a year. The next day he had hives were much worse and his fever was going up. The hives were worse on his left arm and his arm was red around the vaccination site. He also had swelling in his face and he was having a little trouble breathing. I gave him Benadryl and Zyrtec which helped as well as Pepcid. The breathing difficulty subsided after that. He got a different rash on his back that was different from the original hives. We continued the medications and he was still Febrile until the sixth day. The sore throat is still present after nine days but the fever and hives are gone.

Gave 10ml Benadryl 12,5/5 solution. Approx. 10 minutes later pt indicated he was having &#34;a little&#34; difficulty breathing. Dad said he has Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and that his breathing was likely due to stress reaction.  pt was ok a short time later and dad said if reaction continued, or his breathing worsened that he would take him to the ER.  I followed up with dad an hour later and dad said the bumps were still there, but son&#39;s breathing was fine.

Thought it might be related to sun exposure, but went to specialty doctor who recommended blood work done. When that came back as normal, doctor said it may be due to reaction from vaccine. Took antihistamine for several days and the rash and itching has gotten better.  The doctor thought it could possibly be a reaction to the second dose of vaccine and urged us to report it.

                                                Three days after the 1st COVID shot, the patient developed a rash on the inner side of elbow on the left arm. The rash developed into blisters, serum/clear liquid bumps, and formed scars after bursting. The rash gradually increased in surface area as it progressed, and would itch after exercise. The patient took prednisone and amoxicillin, and as of today the affected area covers most of the upper arm, although it itches less than before.

                                                He woke up with chest pain in the upper right quadrant at midnight and then it intensified when he was breathing deep breaths. They woke him up when he was sleeping and did not go away. Then, it continued through the next day and we asked our doctor if we needed to keep an eye on him because of all the reporting and stuff about the heart problems. They did a triage consult visit to see if it could be an adverse event from the vaccine. The course of action was to take 2 ibuprofen every 4 hours and use ice and heat to see if the pain improved to rule out musculoskeletal situations because that was what they thought it was. We did that for 2 days and then the pain moved to his back upper right quadrant and we noticed a rash all over his abdomen and we were not sure where he got that. Based on the fact that the pain moved the doctor was more confident that it was not an adverse event.

After 2 days of the oral medication it got worse. went back to pediatric doctor and was referred to dermatologist who prescribed a topical steroid and 10 mg of zyrtec and after a week and a half the rash is not better. This is still ongoing and very frustrating. Called my local health department and was advised to contact an allergist-immology doctor and report to CDC. will be calling today. It has now been over a month since this started.

He also had little bumps, petichae all over his body.  He still has the bruising and he had a sore, scab where he fell down before the vaccine and he could not stop the bleeding at the site. I took him to ER, performed a complete blood work and platelet count. On 06-22-2021, his platelet count had dropped to 15,000.  The ER did not admit him and we had to go back to the ER last Thursday 06-24-2021 and his platelet count 13,000.

                                                Patient received vaccine together with his family (he was 3rd out of 4). He said the shot hurt. After all were vaccinated, he said he felt weird. I had him sit for monitoring with his family. His parent told me he still felt weird, and that they walked around the store, but now he has a bad headache and feels a little winded. I had him sit in the immunization room with mask off for further monitoring. After a few more minutes, he said it felt like he was suffocating. I administered 1 Epi-Pen at 10:08PM in his left thigh and called an ambulance. Soon after, he was shaking/shivering, but said it was getting easier to breathe. EMT arrived shortly after, noted the hives on his back, and took him to the hospital.

The patient had a CBC done and showed he had thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 15,000.  He was evaluated by hematology and the CBC repeated and showed platelet count was indeed very low at 13,000.  He was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.  No treatment was given, observation only.  Patient had Covid antibodies performed and on 7/1/2021 he had a positive IgM antibody to COVID-19 and a negative IgG antibody to COVID-19.  He was ANA negative.  His platelet antibodies were positive confirming the diagnosis of autoimmune thrombocytopenia.

                                                My son was given the Pfizer Vaccine on 6-24-2021 and a few days later his back being having involuntary movements (spams) and than he told me a day or so later his left arm where he had the shot started to have involuntary movements as well. On Sunday July 11th I noticed his arm jumping and I asked him why is he jerking his arm he said it?s doing it on it?s own. I scheduled an appointment for him to be seen by his doctor. He was seen on July 13th, they saw him and gave us these forms to fill out and asked us a series of questions. He was scheduled to take the second dose of the Pfizer Vaccine on July 15th but I will not take him until I?m sure this is not a side effect of the Vaccine. Any information would be very helpful.

                                                After about 15 hours, my son was experiencing injection site pain, was feeling tired, had a mild headache, muscle pain (mostly in his legs), some mild chills, some joint pain, arm pain, feeling &#34;unwell&#34;, and was running a fever of approximately 100 degrees.  After 24 hours of rest, drinking water and  Gatorade, and three doses of over the counter Acetaminophen (one full adult dose followed by two half-doses) he awoke the next morning feeling much better.  He continues to do well as I am writing this, which is now 50 hours since the injection.

                                                PT had his first dose of Pfizer vaccine at 5pm on 21st. He looked low energy at night. We felt his forehead and he was warmer than usual. However, thermometer did not show he had a fever. He looked much better in the morning on 22nd. We thought that was it.  Only after a week did PT tell us he had more reaction. However, because he was well then, we did not pay too much attention. When we learned of the link between Covid 19 vaccine and Myocarditis, we asked him in detail again. Here are his responses.  He started feeling his throat hurt when he had dinner that around 7pm. It lasted only that night.  He started feeling chest pain around dinner time too. It only hurt when he moved. That chest pain lasted longer and disappeared on the 23rd.  He started feeling there were air bubbles under his skin on the flat part of his left shoulder (above the injection site and below his neck) on the 22nd. He did not see them. He just felt them. When he pressed them with fingers, he felt them popping. This feeling lasted for a total of three days. He could feel the amount of air bubbles become less over the three days.   We have not seen any side effect in the news like his. We are not sure that he should get his second dose. Please someone could advise us, please send us an email. Much appreciated.

                                                This is a 15 year old male without PMHx  who presents with chest pain for one day after having Pfizer COVID vaccine 2-3 days prior. As per father patient had first dose without any sx except mild soreness on the site of injection. On 6/9/21 he received the second shot of Pfizer vaccine. That day he only fell mild pain on site of infection only. Next day he suffered from chills, HA, and fever. He took Tylenol for it. The day prior admission he had a mild headache and pain on the middle of the chest, dull, not radiating, and on/off. There was one episode of emesis after dinner and after taking TUMS he went to sleep. The parents check on him through the night and upon waking up he complaint still with chest pain, now increased and radiating to left side of the chest. The parents decided to bring him to ED for evaluation where he was found to have elevated troponins and he was admitted for myocarditis likely secondary to the Pfizer vaccine.  His troponins were monitored q8hrs and he was started on Toradol q6hrs. See EKG and Echo results below. Due to increasing troponins 6/13, he was given IVIG with resulting improvement. At this time, we are still monitoring his troponin inpatient with plan for potential cardiac MRI. He will be discharged home on Ibuprofen 600mg TID and follow up with cardiology with exercise restriction likely for a few months, tbd by outpatient cardiology follow up.

                                                Mom reports that nurse/vaccine administrator injected son/patient at a higher than usual site on the shoulder and the needle did not go in all the way, in fact of the needle was outside his skin. The skin around the needle puncture &#34;bubbled&#34; up and it caused him pain (more than the 1st dose when he received it). No leakage of vaccine fluid was observed. He had some soreness in the arm. The next day he did develop some nausea, body aches, and slight fever. He is feeling a bit better today (6/14) and only has some nausea remaining. Mom will take him to PCP to evaluate his Left shoulder since it is still achy.

                                                Fifteen hours after the vaccine my son woke up and his respiratory rate was high. It was over 140. I woke him up and he had chills and diarrhea. Because of his Cortisol Deficiency I called his doctor. I was advised to give him 30mg Hydrocortisone and lots of water.  His Respiratory and heart rate were high. He was feeling a little short of breath and he had heart palpitations. We went to the ER and they did lots of testing. He had a fever and Sepsis testing. All results were normal and they gave him a Liter of fluids. He was discharged after two hours and his pulse was still high at 105-110. We monitored him and his heart rate was slowing and he started to feel better. His Endocrinologist had him take a double dose of Hydrocortisone the next day. His improvement progressed and by the fourth day the symptoms were gone.  He was able to do his normal activities but tired and worn out from the ordeal. One week later he had a slightly elevated heart rate but it resolved quickly.  He had had a local reaction in his arm with swelling and a rash after the first vaccine.

Rash on lower extremities - serpiginous and lacey most consistent with serum sickness like reaction.  Rash very classic for this, but unclear if flu-like symptoms and fever were typical immunogenic effects of vaccine vs SSLR.  Rash was not itchy and improved overnight prior to clinic presentation on 6/16 (vaccine on 6/14).  Took benadryl x 2.  Patient well in clinic with no residual fever and improved overall.  No treatment given in clinic and no medicine prescribed for home.

He denied itching.  He did not experience any additional symptoms.  His vital signs were stable and he was breathing comfortably and speaking in full sentences.  He received 25 mg capsule of Benadryl with some improvement seen in rash on arms and shins.  He was discharged to home after being monitored in the health center for about 90 minutes after vaccination.  Vital signs remained normal.  He was accompanied by his mother who was going to be able to watch him closely and with a prescription for Benadryl to take prn every 6 hours.  Mom was instructed to call 911 for any worsening including difficulty breathing.

We gave him an allergy pill but that didn&#39;t really help. We saw an Allergist (6/30) and he mentioned, it wasn&#39;t hives but that he would need to research if he could get another shot based on the reaction. After this weekend, Patient said his back would sting when he would get hot so I called back the doctor. On Wednesday, he prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream. We have used it once so far and Patient&#39;s back does look a little better but the rash is still there.

We slowed his descent, but he had a small abrasion on his head (I think from the carpet).  He said he felt dizzy and nauseous.  I&#39;m  not sure if he was also watching while I was giving his sibling the shot and  that exacerbated the situation. We had him checked out by EMT and he was fine after the initial fainting.

                                                The patient had COVID-19 in July 2020. In August 2020, he developed a whole body pustular rash. He was then admitted for an &#34;asthma exacerbation&#34; and found to have hilar lymphadenopathy. He was treated with several courses of prednisone for his asthma during the next few months. Within few days of his first dose of the COVID19 vaccine he developed fever and severe exacerbation of his rash (which thought to be acne at that time) that resulted in hospitalization on 6/7/2021. Interestingly, he received his second dose of the meningococcal vaccine (MCV4P, Menactra, lot # U6877BA) on 6/7/2021. The patient has been treated with antimicrobials (both antibiotics and antivirals, completed course) and high-dose corticosteroids (both oral and IV) and is slowly improving. He has severe skin scarring.
