Mom called on 05/17/2021 and informed that patient developed rash on inner thigh on the morning of 05/17/2021 .He was fine all day on 05/16/2021 and woke up with a rash in his inner thigh. Mom gave him Bendryl but he called mom again after few hours with a rash on his hand. Mom took the child to urgent care in the afternoon and the doctor was confused as to why he got a rash after more than 12 hours later. The doctor was not sure if it was due to the vaccine. The doctor advised Benadryl and gave a prescription of prednisone to keep on hand incase symptoms worsen.

Lymph nodes were swollen on neck underneath those red patches. Itchy - On that Sunday, when I noticed it, the Pharmacist said to take: Oral Benadryl and topical Benadryl for adverse reaction.  We did that for a week and it started to go away. I outlined the rash with sharpie  - t did get bigger and started spreading down his shoulders.

                                                Patient started to develop a cough on the second day of the vaccine around 6 pm. The cough was accompanied by shortness of breath, given his asthma we assumed this was some asthma related reaction to the vaccine. Nonetheless, that evening he started to complain about chest pain every time he laid back on his bed. This symptom is not common in previous asthma attacks. Sitting up alleviated the symptom, chest pain and shortness of breath lasted for 2 nights (Sunday and Monday evening), by Tuesday he felt better. We assumed this was an asthma episode, but recent reports of Myocarditis leads us to believe the had a mild myocarditis episode, given the chest pain while lying down.  He also had typical COVID vaccine symptoms such as low grade fever (100F), pain in the vaccination site, congestion, and itchy throat.

Start date is approximate but she thought it was within a week of the first vaccine dose. Patient developed an itchy rash on his buttocks and waist. Mom described the rash as small pinpoints. She thinks it lasted 1-2 weeks. Treated with OTC hydrocortisone, no medical care. Rash was fully resolved when patient received his second Pfizer dose on 6/10/21 and he has not developed a similar rash; advised family to call back if he experiences the reaction again.

Highest recorded temp was 102.2 at approx. 30 hours after shot.   Fatigue interfered with daily activities from 12 hours after shot to 36 hours after shot.  Mild soreness in arm where shot was given.   Pulse and blood oxygen were checked each time temp was taken (approx 3 times between 24 and 36 hours after shot) and were within normal ranges each time; although pulse was on the higher end of the normal range for a 12 year old boy.  Quick recover starting 36 hours after shot, when temp reduced to approx. 100.  Appetite returned at this time.  Fever was gone by 48 hours after shot and all other side effect seemed to have subsided by this point.  No mediation was taken by the vaccine recipient.  Vaccine recipient was offered usual foods and he consumed milk and water in smaller amounts than usual but also more frequently than usual to stay hydrated.

                                                My child began feeling tired and ran a temperature about a degree warmer than usual for the first three days after his second COVID vaccine on Sunday 13 June. (So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). Thursday he was extra tired and began to complain of itching under the chin in the evening. Friday morning he woke up and had what he described as itchy/painful raised, red patches of skin on his right collarbone, under his chin, across his face (right cheek, temple). His temperature was about 100* and he was, quite frankly, pretty miserable. These weren&#39;t little skin irritations, they were giant patches of inflamed tissue covering the better part of each cheek, his temple, under the chin and then in smaller spots on his collarbones and back. Saturday the rash moved to cover the left side of his face, and the left collarbone. (And no, for the record, I did not switch laundry detergents, change his diet or anything like that.) As of today, 6/21 condition has improved but not fully resolved.

Had him sit, take off his mask, gave him water to sip, took BP (102/60), within 5 minutes he started to come back around, was able to follow command (wiggle fingers) vocalize that he could breathe fine, and felt that there was water behind his ears. His temperature to touch seemed to start to go back down, and once paramedics arrived they evaluated him and released him as &#34;ok&#34; within 10 minutes.

                                                Got the 1st dose of COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine and after 24hours, kid got rash on the stomach and left shoulder and it became worse day by day. Have seen the pediatric and after examination, she mentioned that it could be Pityriasis Rosea  and advised to see a dermatologist and also report this event.  I am reporting this as advised by the pediatrician.  Not sure if this is the side effect of vaccine but believe it could be because this started after 24hrs of receiving vaccine.

Nothing concerning but right before he went to bed he didn&#39;t feel good. My son thought he had to vomit but couldn&#39;t. He said his HEARTBEAT WAS SO MUCH FASTER than normal. I got so concerned that I slept next to him which I never did before. He fell asleep after 1 h and woke up the next morning and felt fine. I did not go to the doctor because he was feeling well the next day.

                                                His mother was present and told us he had multiple allergies to foods and sulfites, as well as asthma. He used to carry an epi pen but does not currently, also has a history of asthma for which he carries a rescue inhaler. He received the Pfizer vaccine at approximately 9:15am in his left deltoid, and about 2 minutes later Mom notified me and the school nurse that he was starting to get &#34;hives&#34;. I noted a localized, small area of erythema on his left upper arm around the bandaid, approximately silver dollar sized, not raised. School RN removed the bandaid. He did not complain of itching and at that time stated he felt like he was breathing fine. The school RN gave him 50mg of Benadryl PO per the mom&#39;s request at 0920. The patient was in no distress, breathing and speaking normally. At 0922 he stated he felt like his throat and tongue were swelling, so I had him remove his mask, and asked mom if his lips looked swollen to which she responded &#34;yes&#34;. He stated it felt like it was hard to swallow. We placed a pulse ox on the patient and his oxygen saturations were 96-100%, HR 85-90, RR 30. We administered an adult epi pen (0.3mg of epinephrine) into his left lateral thigh at 0923 and had the school office call EMS. The patient remained in no acute distress, and said the swelling in his tongue felt better after the epi, but that his throat still felt swollen. Lungs clear bilaterally, RR remained 24-30, HR 110-115, pulse ox 98-100%, erythema on left upper arm resolved. Fire department arrived at 0935- report given and they checked a pulse ox as well. Patient walked to parking lot to ambulance for transfer to Hospital with mother following behind.

Patient reported them being itchy.  Patient&#39;s PCP was notified and a telehealth visit was performed.  Patient&#39;s PCP recommended Benadryl every 4-6 hours.  Hives would wane and return for the next 4 days.  Hives were on arms, chest, back, buttocks, and legs throughout the five days.  Patient began Zyrtec on Monday morning and continued Zyrtec through Wednesday.  Allergy was e-consulted to discuss the second dose of the vaccine and if patient should receive it.  Allergy recommended Zyrtec one hour prior to second dose and have PCP prescribe epi-pen in case of more severe reaction.

Hasn&#39;t reoccurred since that time. Still feels somewhat tired today with mildly sore right arm. No fevers. No chest pain today.    IR showed second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was given to the left arm but confirmed with CVS that it was given to the right arm.

                                                Fever - up to 102 - lasted until yesterday - it was back down to normal yesterday. He has had a sore arm - at injection site; the arm also was hard - a lump that was a little bit  palpable  - which is gone now; - body aches - gone now, chills, difficulty swallowing. He didn&#39;t have trouble breathing, but he felt his throat tighten when he swallowed (still has this); upper right abdominal pain - that is the real bad symptom still. His eyes hurt when he moved them around. Fatigue. He&#39;s been glued to the couch since Friday. I had given Advil and Tylenol. After the prolonged fever, I eventually called into the doctor&#39;s office. The pediatrician said it was common and said to wait it out but seek treatment if it got worse. He is able to eat but is awful nauseous. He is eating what sounds good. The pain stays the same when he eats.

A 13-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0164, expiration date: 31Aug2021), at the age of 13 years old, in left arm on 14May2021 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was a normal 13 years old, he doesn&#39;t take anything, he&#39;s active. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The vaccines administered on same date with BNT162B2 was none. The previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient previously received the flu shot every year and experienced no adverse event. On 16May2021, about 48 hours after the vaccination, the patient started having stomach pain in the middle of the night. It began 16May2021 in the evening and into 17May2021, the patient was having stomach pain and not feeling well. Reporter stated the patient woke her up. Reporter stated they thought it was some food he ate. Reporter stated they tested his covid antibodies and they also personally at home on 17May2021 night, they tested him with a home kit for covid just to double check because nobody really brought it up and it was negative also. Reporter confirmed the home covid test was done on 17May2021. Reporter stated there was no known exposure, they just did it to make sure he didn&#39;t have covid. The patient was taken to the emergency room on 18May2021. Reporter stated they were waiting because patient felt good during the day and they thought nothing was wrong, but then the extreme stomach pain started again and so on 18May2021, she took him to the local emergency room. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t do much other than push on his stomach, she was worried about appendicitis. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t worry too much, but she thought maybe it was his appendix. The doctor examined him and said he had a stomach issue and released him with medicine and that was the 18May2021. On 19May2021 and 20May2021, the patient would get intermittent stomach pain, again thinking it was a stomach bug or something. On 20May2021, the patient experienced petechial rash on his legs. Reporter called the pediatrician and again the patient was having intermittent stomach pain and kept having it intermittently. The patient would feel fine then feel sick again then on the 22May2021, the patient had more bad stomach pain and some vomiting so he wound up back in the emergency department, it was a different one than the first on 22May2021. The patient did a lot of blood work, his labs came back good, but he did not do a CAT scan, but reporter tried to do everything else, tested patient for covid, antibodies and everything and they sent him home again on the 22May2021. The patient had intermittent pain again throughout 23May2021 then on 24May2021, he went to visit the pediatrician just for a visit and they were thinking its Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) which is an autoimmune response and they still didn&#39;t have a diagnosis for his stomach. Reporter stated patient was perfectly fine at the pediatrician, then when they got home, he started having lower left abdominal pain and he doubled over in pain and started vomiting. The patient vomited about three times in total, it wasn&#39;t like excessive vomiting. Reporter stated the pain would bring it on, he does have a rash, which is still getting a little bit worse. Reporter stated they took him back to the emergency room, they did a CAT scan and that showed he had inflammation in his intestines and his stomach so they kept him in the hospital. The patient was admitted on 24May2021 when he visited the emergency room for the third time. Reporter stated because patient was in pain, they admitted him to watch him. Reporter stated they were worried about the patient having intussusception with the bowel, where his bowel can go inside each other and can create a blockage, so they wanted to admit him to make sure that didn&#39;t happen. Reporter stated the worst of the stomach pain was on 25May2021, which would have been at 19:00. The patient had not had an episode since then, he hadn&#39;t had an attack like that since. The whole week before from 17May2021, or the 16May2021 when it started through 25May2021, it was very intermittent of a lot of pain. So far, knock on wood, the patient hadn&#39;t had it since 25May2021 at 19:00 and hopefully tonight it won&#39;t happen. Reporter stated it will be about 48 hours of not having the bad pain. Reporter stated he still has some pain, but not like where she had to rush him to the emergency room. The patient&#39;s vomiting ended on 24May2021 or 25May2021. He had recovered completely from vomiting so far. The patient was released on 26May2021 with a diagnosis of HSP, which was an auto immune response, and he&#39;d never had this happen before. Reporter stated if she googled HSP, it said it can still get worse, but it was not the worst case of HSP. Reporter stated the patient has never had anything like this before, he was perfectly fine, they made it through covid and didn&#39;t get covid and he is a healthy kid so she thought Pfizer should know. The outcome of the events HSP, stomach pain, petechial rash was not recovered. The outcome of vomiting was recovered on 24May2021 or 25May2021. The outcome of the events inflammation in intestines and stomach, didn&#39;t feel well/feel sick, intermittent pain and lower left abdominal pain was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient received vaccine and stayed in pharmacy building for 15 minutes.  Around that time patient&#39;s parents came back up to pharmacy to notify staff that he had broken out into a rash in the back and his hands felt swollen.  I asked if he had any trouble breathing and parents stated no.  We followed the Adverse Event Action Plan.  We called 911.  Patient&#39;s parents then stated son is starting to have some breathing issue.  I came out with EpiPen and was going to administer when mom stated son&#39;s symptoms has resolved greatly and she did not want me to administer EpiPen.  Shortly after EMS arrived and evaluated patient and took him to hospital for observation.

                                                Patient was examined by his pediatrician and cleared for physical exercise on 06/01/2021; 4 days before receiving his 1st COVID19 shot on 06/05/2021. On 06/07/2021 we dropped patient off at Soccer Camp. At 10am he started basic soccer ball control drills, which did not include rigorous exercise. At 10:30am we received a call from him, asking for us to pick him up as he had almost blacked out a few times.  We arrived at the sports field at 10:40am. I found patient to be red faced, sweaty, but cohesive. He described the following symptoms occurred during mild exercise: difficulty breathing, thirsty, fast heartbeat, &#34;black things&#34; over eyes, preventing clear vision, difficulty focusing, difficulty hearing, feeling faint  He took a water break and used his pro-air inhaler, as he thought he might have been having his 1st asthma attack (he&#39;s only ever presented with slight wheezing or night time cough). After a short break, his symptoms subsided, so he re-joined the group. After one more soccer drill, the symptoms came back again, but this time he experienced very hard palpitations and the feeling that his shoes were squeezing his feet. At that point he asked for permission to call to us and have us collect him.  We took him home and monitored him for a while. He seemed calm and symptom free. I had him shower and he was fine for the rest of the day.  The following day I had him jog on our treadmill for a period. He was symptom free. I increased inclination on the treadmill and he handled it ok without any of the previous symptoms. However, now realizing that he was within the 3 day window of his COVID shot, I decided not take him back to the soccer camp.   As of 06/13/2021 he has not complained of any symptoms returning. That said, he also has not performed any significant outdoor exercise since then either, besides walking.

                                                During the night that he got the vaccine my son woke up with hives and I gave him some Benadryl. I gave him his rescue inhaler in the afternoon. He has not used his inhaler for over a year. The next day he had hives were much worse and his fever was going up. The hives were worse on his left arm and his arm was red around the vaccination site. He also had swelling in his face and he was having a little trouble breathing. I gave him Benadryl and Zyrtec which helped as well as Pepcid. The breathing difficulty subsided after that. He got a different rash on his back that was different from the original hives. We continued the medications and he was still Febrile until the sixth day. The sore throat is still present after nine days but the fever and hives are gone.

                                                Patient had hives appear about 4-5 hours after his second Pfizer Covid vaccine was administered on 6/6/21.  He had hives on his arms, legs, stomach, torso, and groin.  He said they were very itchy. No signs of any other issues, so we gave him Benadryl and monitor him. He continued to have hives for about 36 hours. We continue the same course of care and gave him Benadryl during that 36 hour period. The hives eventually went away and he has not had any other issues as of today 06/21/2021.

Gave 10ml Benadryl 12,5/5 solution. Approx. 10 minutes later pt indicated he was having &#34;a little&#34; difficulty breathing. Dad said he has Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and that his breathing was likely due to stress reaction.  pt was ok a short time later and dad said if reaction continued, or his breathing worsened that he would take him to the ER.  I followed up with dad an hour later and dad said the bumps were still there, but son&#39;s breathing was fine.

                                                PT had his first dose of Pfizer vaccine at 5pm on 21st. He looked low energy at night. We felt his forehead and he was warmer than usual. However, thermometer did not show he had a fever. He looked much better in the morning on 22nd. We thought that was it.  Only after a week did PT tell us he had more reaction. However, because he was well then, we did not pay too much attention. When we learned of the link between Covid 19 vaccine and Myocarditis, we asked him in detail again. Here are his responses.  He started feeling his throat hurt when he had dinner that around 7pm. It lasted only that night.  He started feeling chest pain around dinner time too. It only hurt when he moved. That chest pain lasted longer and disappeared on the 23rd.  He started feeling there were air bubbles under his skin on the flat part of his left shoulder (above the injection site and below his neck) on the 22nd. He did not see them. He just felt them. When he pressed them with fingers, he felt them popping. This feeling lasted for a total of three days. He could feel the amount of air bubbles become less over the three days.   We have not seen any side effect in the news like his. We are not sure that he should get his second dose. Please someone could advise us, please send us an email. Much appreciated.

His troponins were monitored q8hrs and he was started on Toradol q6hrs. See EKG and Echo results below. Due to increasing troponins 6/13, he was given IVIG with resulting improvement. At this time, we are still monitoring his troponin inpatient with plan for potential cardiac MRI. He will be discharged home on Ibuprofen 600mg TID and follow up with cardiology with exercise restriction likely for a few months, tbd by outpatient cardiology follow up.

The skin around the needle puncture &#34;bubbled&#34; up and it caused him pain (more than the 1st dose when he received it). No leakage of vaccine fluid was observed. He had some soreness in the arm. The next day he did develop some nausea, body aches, and slight fever. He is feeling a bit better today (6/14) and only has some nausea remaining. Mom will take him to PCP to evaluate his Left shoulder since it is still achy.

                                                Fifteen hours after the vaccine my son woke up and his respiratory rate was high. It was over 140. I woke him up and he had chills and diarrhea. Because of his Cortisol Deficiency I called his doctor. I was advised to give him 30mg Hydrocortisone and lots of water.  His Respiratory and heart rate were high. He was feeling a little short of breath and he had heart palpitations. We went to the ER and they did lots of testing. He had a fever and Sepsis testing. All results were normal and they gave him a Liter of fluids. He was discharged after two hours and his pulse was still high at 105-110. We monitored him and his heart rate was slowing and he started to feel better. His Endocrinologist had him take a double dose of Hydrocortisone the next day. His improvement progressed and by the fourth day the symptoms were gone.  He was able to do his normal activities but tired and worn out from the ordeal. One week later he had a slightly elevated heart rate but it resolved quickly.  He had had a local reaction in his arm with swelling and a rash after the first vaccine.

Rash very classic for this, but unclear if flu-like symptoms and fever were typical immunogenic effects of vaccine vs SSLR.
