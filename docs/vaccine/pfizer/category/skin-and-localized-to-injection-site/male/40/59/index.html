The following day I had mild muscle soreness and injection site pain without swelling or redness.

On 1/11/21 the headache  worsened to 4/10 and was associated with myalgias and neck stiffness.  After a jog, I was in the shower and noticed a rash all over my body that had been pruritic.  I went to the ER that night where I tested negative for flu A/B and also tested negative for covid (Antigen then PCR).  Got a CMP, CBC, and coags to rule out ITP.  everything was normal.  The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

A 42-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 (at the age of 42-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications were reported as none. On an unspecified date (&#34;roughly&#34; 6 hours after the vaccine was administered) the patient experienced &#34;muscle ache&#34;, &#34;chills&#34;, &#34;headache is so severe most disturbing one; it was getting too bad, my head want to fall off, I could not work&#34; and &#34;left arm is too sore way it was administered&#34;. The patient reported that he called &#34;because he took the COVID-19 vaccine last night and he had been having reactions from last time till this time&#34; (as reported). The patient stated that there was no doctor that prescribed the medication, it was administered to him because he was a healthcare worker (certified nursing assistant). He stated that he had been having &#34;muscle ache, chills and severe headache, the headache is so severe, the most disturbing one.&#34; He reported that one of the Tylenol doses was administered to him by the nurse that administered the vaccine. He reported that he took some Tylenol and ibuprofen but this time it was not helping. He stated that he received the vaccine about 24 hours ago and started to experience muscle ache, chills and severe headache roughly about 6 hours after the administration. He reported that &#34;I could hang in, but it was getting too bad, my head wanted to fall off, so I am driving home now so I could not work.&#34; When the patient was asked about the vaccine dose and route he stated &#34;I believe normal dose I believe, I cannot remember I cannot recap anything, but I know it was administered in my left arm, my left arm is too sore the way it was administered.&#34; He stated that he received the vaccination for prevention and to be on the safe side. The patient stated that he did lab work with his doctor a few months ago, probably around 6 or 7 months ago. The clinical outcome of the events &#34;muscle ache&#34;, &#34;chills&#34;, &#34;headache is so severe most disturbing one; it was getting too bad, my head want to fall off, I could not work&#34; were all not recovered/not resolved, while the clinical outcome of the event &#34;left arm is too sore way it was administered&#34; was unknown.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

                                                After the required wait period of 15 minutes I started to drive back home which is 77 miles from the hospital that administered the vaccination.  Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

It was around 72 hours in which acute muscle soreness occurred at the injection site on my right deltoid. I thought it would resolve like the first dose after three or four days, but this seem to last longer and then it mysteriously begin to travel down my arm. It seems like every one or two days it went more distal down my right upper extremity. It first went from my deltoid to my bicep and tricep. And then a couple days later it was in my elbow and forearm. Now it has been in my elbow for weeks leaving me with weakness and pain that nothing seems to help improve it.

                                                extremely bad dry mouth; lips were going numb; facial numbness; rash from his neck to his nipple line; BP was 180/110 / BP stayed around 160/100; felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling; felt flush; uncomfortable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 44-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EH9899) 1st dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 in the evening time (around 6-7 or maybe a little later) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the COVID Vaccine that same day, his heart rate went up and then it came down and he was fine. Later that night while sleeping he got up again because he could feel his heart rate going up. It was not way up, but he could tell it was up. He was trying to catch an actual reading on the monitor of his heart rate, but he was not able to before it came back down. He was calling because he is wondering if this was considered a severe allergic reaction. He got the vaccine and was able to walk to his car. His mouth got dry right after the vaccine within a minute or two and noticed his heart rate went up. Treatment: He took some deep breaths and drunk water and it got better. He drove home, but that at nighttime while sleeping he noticed his heart rate went up a couple of times, but then it came back down. He could not get a reading of heart rate right away. The highest he saw on the monitor that he was able to capture was 101 and then it came back down. He was not sure if this was because he was nervous. He just had a couple of episodes that night and then nothing again. He also experienced his arm being sore from the vaccination. However, he stated that is to be expected. He stated the arm sore started a few days after getting the COVID Vaccine and then it was gone. Stated he was calling because he was concerned because Pfizer said to report any issues. He started to feel better and added this may not even be an issue. He just got concerned. Mentioned he was not sure if real side effects or if he was over thinking things. Outcome of the events was resolved.

                                                As soon as I received the shot and went into the waiting area, I experienced a tingling sensation down my right arm where the injection was administered. Throughout the 15 minutes the sensation began to radiate throughout my body and extremities. I waited about 20 minutes before deciding to leave the facility and proceed with my afternoon.  Once I got home, I experienced chills, which I read on the pamphlet was an expected side effect. Both hands and feet were cold and I put on additional layers and lied on the couch and rested. During that time I began to notice the tingling sensation/paresthesia predominantly in the injected (right) arm, but also sporadically in other parts of my body including thigh (front/back), left arm, elbow, back, torso, neck, head, wrists, buttocks, etc. This sensation continued as I prepared for bed and continues as of this writing.  It&#39;s difficult to say whether the sensation is getting better or worse, but it is consistent best described as someone pricking you every so often.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2.

Patient was taken by ambulance to the emergency room.  Patient then asked if he should get the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of severe allergic reaction with multiple symptoms cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.

ED drew blood cultures and then started vancomycin.  Vitals normal and stable in ED.  Admitted to hospital.  Provider notes on 2nd day of admission as follows.  Cellulitis and abscess of the right medial thigh likely secondary to a skin tag tear which introduced infection.

He is not going to tolerate a bedside incision and drainage.  We will plan on proceeding to the operating room tomorrow for quick I&amp;D and cultures.  Procedures been explained.  The wound will need to be packed afterwards and ultimately healed in.  Patient seems understand plan and we will proceed accordingly

The next day around lunch time the hives came back again I had a very red and tingling area around my neck and in my head. I returned to the walk in clinic and they gave me shot of Benadryl and prednisone and another drug I do not remember.

Narrative:  12/21 employee received vaccine at 0930 - later in the afternoon he noted tachycardia to about 100. He was watching the rate on his Apple watch. The highest rate was 130. His only other symptom was fatigue which was bad enough on 12/22 that he had to go home. He saw his PCP on 12/22 for the tachycardia who ordered labs which were all normal. He is a resident so he asked anesthesia to do an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia. On 12/23 his heart rate average went down to 100. Today (12-28) his resting heart rate is 70-80 which is his baseline. He has not had recurrence of the tachycardia since 12/23. He also reports he had soreness at the injection site and myalgias both of which have since resolved.

A 47-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), unknown on 18Dec2020 (lot number: EK5730) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Caller is a Physician Assistant. Caller states that she is calling about the Covid Vaccine. She had a patient received his first dose of the vaccine on Friday 18Dec2020, 3 days later on 21Dec2020 he had an urticarial rash that persisted, The urticarial rash was treated with prednisone and resolved by 27Dec2020, it has not reoccurred. The allergist said it was a delayed hyper sensitive reaction that was Prompted by the immune simulation from the vaccine. The Patient was treated for the urticaria.  Caller would like to know if a patient experienced an allergic reaction to the first dose is there anything prophylactically needing to be done when administering the second dose of the Covid vaccine? Caller is very upset and frustrated and stating she wants to speak to someone that is a clinician with the clinical trial team who can give her recommendations for a specific patient. Caller asks if they should do Prophylaxis with antihistamines for the second dose. He did not have anaphylaxis but he had angioedema. Caller states that she did a Vaers report on 22Dec2020, but no one contacted her. He started taking Zyrtec and Vistaril. The Allergist said it was fine and he will still need the 2nd Booster Dose. The Angioedema started on 22Dec2020, it was also treated with prednisone, in addition to being administered Benadryl IM, and Vistaril. The outcome of the event urticarial rash was recovered on 27Dec2020 and Angioedema was recovered on 22Dec2020.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                8 minutes after the vaccine i satrt to experience some tingling to my left earlobe. It then radiated to my left jaw line where i felt an onset of numbness. the numbness hten radited to my left shoulder all the way down to my left extrremity digits. atthat time i waived over a nurse who waived a physician who check my radial pulse, pulse was noted in the 70&#39;s. At that time the physician  asked a EMT perofrmed four evalautions of my BP and my BP was reading syttolically between was 140-150 and my datolics was reading 110-115. Throughout that time the numbness was still to my left side of my face and shoulder and arm and to myfingers. This was only localized to those two areas.  At that time it was requested for me to go to the hospital to seek medical attention. I deferrred to going home to check my BP and at that time i was running 150/100.  The numbness was still present and mu thought process my body was stressed out. I then took a nice cold shower with breathing techniques. I did orthastatics on myself. I then followed with my PCP the next day and she ordered bunch of labs, CRP, triponents, CBC, bubble study and chest x-ray and EKG. ALl the testes were deemed to be negative.  My systolics were 120/80 when i saw my PCP, however i was recommedned to take the whole week off and was recommended to go back to work after the new year.  After five days the numbness went away to my digits went away but not to my face.  My grips were equal. I had no Bal palsy nor stroke.  The numbness sill persisted up till day 9 and the umbness to the face went away.

O2 sats somtimes in low 90&#39;s . I am one of the radiology faculty at the hospital I work at. Received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday Dec 18 at about 21:30. After the injection, I had moderate pain at the site of injection about 6 hours later, not unexpected. However, the next evening, I was feeling fatigued and went to bed at about 7 p.m. For the next three hours, I felt chills and finally at about 10 p.m. I took my temp after I felt that my fever had &#34;broke&#34; and temp was 101.9. Used a finger pulse ox just to make sure sats were ok, they were at 97%, but unexpectedly, resting heart rate was 130 bpm. I took some tylenol and called the ER, and they suggested calling the covid hotline pager and coming in if I did not improve. I called the hotline pager, and we discussed things and eventually decided that I should go to the ER as temp remained at 101.6. By the time I reached the ER, my temp was down to 100.8, but pulse still 122 (EKG with no other abnormalities) and BP was 165/100. I had no other symptoms to account another infection. Over the next two hours, vitals became more normal with HR down to 95 to 100, and BP down to 145/85 or so without any other intervention.  Sunday, still with some mild low grade temps of 99.8, but heart rate at 85 to 90 (I&#39;m usually at about 80).   In the ER, we came to the conclusion that my body mounted a significant immune response to the production of antigens after processing the mRNA given the lack of alternative diagnosis and the improvement of sx without any other intervention besides the 500 mg of tylenol I took before coming in.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EL0142) intramuscularly at right shoulder approximately at 17:30 on 29Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity (a little over weight but he is fit). The patient had COVID in the end of Apr2020. The patient had no family medical history and had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no concomitant medication. The second day of the vaccination, the patient called to report body aches, headache, chills, low grade temperature. As he reported, he just woke up and was walking around feeling like he had 1000 pounds on his back and felt like crap. The body aches started in his shoulder and currently all over his neck, back and whole body aches. Chills started last night (vaccination night). He was just trying to get to sleep and had to put an extra sweatshirt on last night. He did not check his temperature until he got up and it was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit. He was not able to provide a start date for the temperature. &#34;Body aches, headache between, chills between, low grade temperature (unspecified start date), feels like crap&#34; were considered developing between 24:00-01:00. He stated that they were all medically significant and he needs a day to recover hopefully. He just felt like he was hit by a truck. The patient had not visited physician or went to ER yet. The outcome of low grade temperature was unknown, chills was resolving and all other events did not resolve at the time of reporting.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events vaccination site pain, headache, chills, and pyrexia were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. The association between the other reported events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded based on temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I have felt totally fine since then. I received the first dose 12/17/2020 in my left arm at 1230pm. I had no side effects except for paining some swelling in the deltoid muscle that lasted a day or so.   I get the full vaccine every year and never have any sort of reaction, even a mild one.   I am a physician and understand the purpose of the vaccine and how it works.

Those symptoms persisted for approximately 12 hours after which I continued to experience injection site pain, but began to experience pain with some numbness that radiated from the injection site distally down my arm and into my pinky and ring fingers on my left hand.  No other symptoms.  As of today the injection site pain persists as does the pain and numbness in my pinky and ring fingers, but I get the feeling that it is getting slightly worse.  The pain and slight numbness is present when I awake, but gets worse throughout the day.  Some evenings there is considerable discomfort.

This is the first of two reports.  This physician which was a 49-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on the right deltoid 17Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated that he received the first dose of the COVID vaccine and he had a pretty bad rash that started 3 days after (noted on 20Dec2020). The rash has since improved since it started but it took forever to improve and mentioned that he was super itchy at night. He also used to be itchy in the day, but now it was just at nigh which was driving him insane. The physician also mentioned that it was a raised maculopapular rash. It started on his neck on the left side as well and increased of both elbows and behind his knees (it was diffuse). He mentioned that he was able to carry on during the day, but he cannot sleep great. He mentioned that it reminded him of poison ivy - the thought of it happening again makes him want to cringe especially with all the terrible stuff he has seen he was scared that his skin will slough off or its going to kill him or something. But overall, he was more concerned about the itching. The physician took over the counter antihistamines and hydrocortisone cream. He did take one dose of expired liquid prednisone (from 5 years ago that his daughter who had for an ear infection). He downed a sip of prednisone and it prevented his itchiness for a day and now was thinking of getting on steroids. The physician also stated that there was one guy he worked with had something similar (AER 2021010285). He received the same lot number and has been itching like crazy. They have both been trying to figure out what to do. It was clear as mud. Then, last week (Jan2021) they saw each other, and they were both having the same issue and suffering separately. They had no exposure to anything similar besides the vaccine. The physician stated that he was about due for 2nd shot. He has been researching and trying to figure out what to do, if he should get the second dose or not. He reported this to VAERs and talked to CDC, but nobody has any recommendations or information. He also tried to look up trial data to see if anyone had reported a similar rash, and he did not find anything. He was calling to see if he should get the second dose, and if Pfizer has any information on this rash being reported. Outcome of pruritic rash was not recovered; recovering from maculopapular rash and unknown for the remaining event. As per causality: He was unsure. It was most likely from the vaccine as he has done nothing differently.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

                                                Early Wednesday morning (2/24) around 5:00AM, I woke up to extreme pain in my left arm, primarily along the upper forearm, inside of my elbow, and lower bicep. There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They&#39;ve prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week. The right arm pain is less than the left arm pain, but at this point seven days later, I am experiencing neuropathic pain in both arms.

                                                11 minutes after vaccine administration I began experiencing prickling sensation of mouth lips followed by prickling sensation of my tongue, increased heart rate and for a few seconds felt my throat tightening.  Symptoms lasted a few minutes.  By the time I was evaluated at the emergency department a few minutes later I was feeling much better.  I did not need to take any medications.  7 hours later I began experiencing itching all over my body however, I never developed a rash.  My heart rate slightly increased.  Simply did not feel well.  Symptoms lasted a few minutes and again resolved without having to take any medications.

A 51-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: 28Dec2020 (as reported)), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at single dose, as a preventive measure for Covid.

The patient reported, &#34;I received my first dose of Covid19 vaccine on Monday (28Dec2020) and it is now Friday and I am still sick and I am wondering how long these symptoms typically take to get better from because it seems like it is day 5 now so&#34;. When probed for events the patient stated, &#34;Everything on the list, fever, chills, aches, my joints ache, some muscle pain, headache, tiredness, injection side swelled up. I was not nauseas or anything like that. I still have fever today. I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7. It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever.&#34; The patient mentioned, &#34;I kind of like started feeling poorly on the 29th (29Dec2020) late at night but on the 30th (30Dec2020) I had fever and everything.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: is always good on an unspecified date, body temperature: 101.7 on 30Dec2020, body temperature: 99 on 01Jan2021 (reported as &#34;I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7. It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever&#34;), and laboratory test: unknown results on Dec2020 (reported as &#34;I did go for full series of stuff, checkup but that was more than 2 weeks ago&#34;). The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

He said he had some pain at the injection site and mild headache in the afternoon; however, around 12 to 1 am in the morning, he was feeling heart palpitation and he felt his muscle twitching from his upper torso which went down to his thigh and no loss of consciousness.  He said he checked his heart rate and it was 70 and he did not have any problems breathing.  He said his heart palpitation felt better after taking some deep breaths.  He said he no longer had heart palpitations or muscle twitching any more.  He denied any other symptoms.   Generally, he appeared well, no facial drooping, awake, alert, oriented, speech clear, and normal gait. (Today)

My fever was 102.8 when I first woke up. I was very nauseous and my fever felt worse. My thermometer would not read any more until my temp came down. I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

A 55-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscular in left arm on 17Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mixed hyperlipidemia. The patient had no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on Jan2021 via intramuscular. On 17Jan2021, the patient experienced nasal and sinus congestion, rash on chest and face, angioedema of lips and periorbital area and wheezing. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received an OTC antihistamine and monitored the condition.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a chronological association and known product safety profile, a causal relationship between event angioedema and BNT162B2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

                                                On  January 8,  I started having a cramping feeling in my right calf. It went on throughout the day without a event.   I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it&#39;s still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it&#39;s lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can&#39;t think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn&#39;t want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn&#39;t know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node&#39;s reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020. His second dose is scheduled tomorrow (14Jan2021) and wants to know if he can still take it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events myalgia and lymphadenopathy were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tendonitis with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.
