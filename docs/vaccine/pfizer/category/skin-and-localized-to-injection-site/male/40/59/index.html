Positively reactive to increased information and seeing improvement in blotchiness. Left at 14:08.

Later that night, about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I experienced mild wheezing for less than 5 minutes, but believe this was likely due to allergies and associated postnasal drip rather than the vaccine.  The following day I had mild muscle soreness and injection site pain without swelling or redness.

A 40-year-old male patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 21Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), COVID-19 in 2020 (Jun2020 or Jul2020; tested positive for COVID-19 at that time and has 3 tests after that which were all negative) and since then lost weight (2020), and root canal. The patient had no issues with vaccines in the past. There were issues with the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, because he would be positive to TB, but this is because of his culture, he is from a specific country, and so they cannot take that vaccine. The patient clarified that he did not take the TB vaccine, what he meant was he is aware he can&#39;t take it. On 21Dec2020, the patient works in healthcare and had a patient that came in that tested positive for COVID-19 and so because of that, everyone including him that came in contact with the COVID-19 positive patient had to check and get tested. This happened the same day as his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the test (Dec2020) came out negative. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had not had any antibody test for COVID-19. The patient asked the doctor, but she never scheduled him for that, until after last month, she talked to him about it, but by that time he told her that he doesn&#39;t need it now - it&#39;s been almost a year. The patient had the first dose on 21Dec2020 and at that time he did experience symptoms the next day (22Dec2020). At that time after the first dose administration (21Dec2020), he could not lift his arm and it was bruised under the arm. The next day (22Dec2020), he had back pain, with his neck he could not turn it (neck pain), he could not be on his left side where he got the shot on left arm, it was like that for 3 days. Then on Thursday (24Dec2020), he had headache every time he bended his head down, he would be sleeping and would wake up in middle of night because of the headache, it felt like a sinus headache on one side of the head, and when he bend his head down, he would feel it, it stayed this way till 29Dec2020 (Tuesday). The patient has a question trying to find out with his employer. They told them they need to take the vaccine, they pushed them to take the vaccine, he works in healthcare. If they get sick at the job, he asked if they (employer) would pay for it, how would he get paid. The job told him he gets paid sick days and asked how they would do that. The patient asked how long the vaccine was alive in the body and how does it work. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I have a reaction to the flu shot so my MD recommended that I premedicate with Zyrtec. I did one hour prior to injection. Around 5 minutes after my injection I could feel my throat swelling. I alerted the nurse and took a Benadryl tablet. The swelling stayed consistent and I was able to breathe so I waited for an hour and then went home. When I arrived home I felt and increase in the swelling so I took another Benadryl. The swelling slightly decreased but was still present for 5 hours post shot and then disappeared.  The only other reaction I had was metallic taste in my mouth and extremely sore arm where injection was given for 2 days.

                                                40 y.o. male with PMHx including asthma and HLD presenting to the ED today with c/f allergic reaction. Pt is coming in after about 35 minutes ago he had some extreme flushing he describes it as &#34;feeling like he put his head in an oven and some skin itchiness on his arms. He notes he started taking niacin today. He also got his second dose of his Covid vaccine last night. He has no throat swelling or difficult breathing. He has not had any nausea or vomiting. He denies any recent fevers or chills. He did switch his asthma medications to Trelegy last week. He otherwise has no other allergies. The patient had just started taking Niacin which is more likely the etiology of the case in question and symptoms rather than the vaccine-pfizer. Most likely this was related to the niacin and not the pfizer vaccine.

Triggers like metal or holding things tight may be a trigger. I&#39;ve never had hives in my life. It&#39;s not debilitating but rather annoying and concerning.

                                                I have a history of neuropathy that has been dormant most of the last year. I went in with no nueropathy occuring to get my vaccines. After the 1st Pfizer shot I had neuropathy starting the day after that went away in about  a week. After the 2nd about 3 days later it started with itching all over my body (neuropathic itch), and burning mostly in my feet, but random electrical shocks throughout my body 24/7 (while awake). It has not subsided and has actually gotten worse. There are at least a dozen people on the clinic message board saying the same thing happened to them, that the vaccine awakened or made worse their neuropathy exponentially. Here is the link to similar complaints.

The first day, following the shot, I had a bit of soreness at the injection site but it was gone by the following day, Friday, 3/26/21. I had a general feeling of weakness the afternoon and into the night on the day of the shot as well. However, it was about midday or a bit after the following day that I began feeling obvious side effects. These include, primarily, a general feeling of being ill. Headache (but that&#39;s not that abnormal &amp; body aches and stiffness similar to a mild version of influenza. It appeared late in the day on Saturday, 3/27/21 and has continued since.

A 40-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscularly, administered in arm left on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 40-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension and COVID-19 prior to vaccination; patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included lisinopril. Patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and the COVID vaccine was received at a Public Health Clinic/Veterans Administration facility. On 15Mar2021, the patient experienced thrombocytopenia (109,000), elevated D dimer (3960), fatigue, subjective fever, headache, sweats, injection site pain and paresthesias of hand on side of injection. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was tested for COVID post-vaccination through a nasal swab and Biofire PCR on 22Mar2021 which were both negative. Therapeutic measure taken as a result of the events included IV hydration. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and close temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product bnt162b2 and all reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Consultation 2 04/16/2021 15:41 ? Consultation 2 Comments discussed with Dr.  we discuss presentation.  he agrees pt will need monitoring with the persisting symptom/findings and the H/O COPD.  1617 Dr has been to ER and completed eval.  pt to be placed on 2nd floor med/tele for additional monitoring and treatment.  pt did have labs yesterday.    ? Decision to Admit Based On  1446 Based on his symptoms and presentation presumptive acute anaphylaxis to component of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  We will begin treatment with 0.3 mg epinephrine IM once as well as dexamethasone, famotidine, diphenhydramine IV. We will continue to monitor with cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  He does have slight wheezing but this may be related to his chronic COPD.  No respiratory distress at this time, but his symptoms seem to have been mildly progressive over the past hour (per his report).  I believe inclusion of the epi to be prudent based on his presentation. Additionally, I will inform the vaccination clinic of this reaction.  he agrees pt will benefit from continued monitoring and repeated IV antihistamine and IV steroid treatment.  Pt will need IVFluid for hydration as well.   Recheck: ? Recheck Recheck 1, Recheck 2, Recheck 3 ? Time 14:55 ? Recheck patient stable  patient improving with treatment ? Comments He is improving.

On 1/11/21 the headache  worsened to 4/10 and was associated with myalgias and neck stiffness.  After a jog, I was in the shower and noticed a rash all over my body that had been pruritic.  I went to the ER that night where I tested negative for flu A/B and also tested negative for covid (Antigen then PCR).  Got a CMP, CBC, and coags to rule out ITP.  everything was normal.  The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

                                                shingles on face and near eye; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 41-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2, lot no. EL3249, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 27Jan2021 05:00 PM at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included HTN (hypertension). No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included losartan, colecalciferol (VIT D3), cyanocobalamin (B 12), ubidecarenone (COQ 10), and fish oil. Historical vaccine included first dose BNT162B2 for Covid-19 immunization on 06Jan2021 05:00 PM (left arm, lot no. EK9231). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient experienced shingles on face and near eye on 30Jan2021 that required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was treated with Valtrex. The event was reported as non-serious (did not result to death, not life threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, and not congenital anomaly/birth defect). Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

Patches on my arms, legs, chest, back, and scalp where it was itchy and the skin became instantly red after I scratched it. I took an anti-histamine once a day (Zyrtec) but it didn&#39;t have any real affect. The irritation seems to have mostly gone away on its own. This has never happened to me before. I visited my doctor and she recommended that I document this reaction.

Pain got up to a level 6/10. Took Extra Strength Tylenol and went to bed early. Following day it still aches some, about the same as the arm area of the shot. Not sharp pain any longer but sore.

Hypothermia.  Couldn&#39;t get warm.  It&#39;s like my body forgot  how to regulate temperature. I&#39;ve only ever experienced similar coming out of anesthesia after surgery.  Took wearing multiple layers of clothes AND multiple blankets just to stabilize my body temp.  It lasted for around 2-3 hours.  This wasn&#39;t normal &#34;chills&#34;.  This was whole-body shaking hypothermia.  Entire body sore afterwards from the involuntary shaking.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get an actual reading as anything to measure body temp was downstairs and I didn&#39;t want to risk falling.

However, after receiving his second dose of the vaccine on 1/15/2021 in his left deltoid, he noted a rash on his bilateral antecubital fossae on the morning of 1/21/2021. He reported that the rash was erythematous in nature, raised, and pruritic describing the presence of small papules over an erythematous patch of skin that was approximately 1 inch in diameter on both sides. He noted the rash on both antecubital fossae at the same time on the morning of 1/21/2021. Since onset, he has been using topical hydrocortisone cream for symptomatic management. Although these lesions have improved, they have not yet completely resolved. He denied any other symptoms associated with the rash and also denied any other exposures or changes in skin products that might have precipitated this rash.

I received the second dose on January 20th -  just had a slightly sore arm.

                                                I have a history of auto immune anemia and ITP.  I checked with my hematologist when scheduled if I should take the shot.  They stated to take it as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/11, I spoke with doctors onsite and discussed my medical history.  They advised to take the shot as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/14, I noticed bleeding in gums and petechiae at the injection site.  I went to hematologist on 02/15, and platelets were at 2,000.  I started 60 mg of prednisone immediately on 02/15.  By 02/19, took blood sample and eceived one 70g dose of IVIG.  Blood results came back on 02/20, and platelets were at 22,000 but did not cover results from after IVIG treatment.  Hematologist decided to stop follow up IVIG treatment and stick to 60mg of prednisone daily as in the past my body has reacted well to it.  On 02/24, platelet count went to 300,000.  I&#39;ve started to taper prednisone to 50mg and will continue with weekly blood tests to verify that platelets remain strong.  Hemoglobin and all over blood levels in the CBC remained normal during this time.  Hematologist has advised not to take second Pfizer COVID-19 shot due to risk.

                                                On Monday I had the COVID vaccination. I noticed no side effects on Tuesday other than tenderness at the injection site. On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mentioned he was a patient facing drug addiction counselor in training, smoke cigarettes but he has cut down to a half a pack a day, at most. The patient previously received flu vaccine on an unspecified date for flu vaccination and experienced soreness at the point of administration of his left arm. Concomitant medications included amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken from an unspecified date for ADHD. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccine this past Thursday, 28Jan2021. The next morning (29Jan2021), he woke up with real soreness at the point of administration of his left arm, well beyond what he remembered for a flu vaccine. The second night (30Jan2021), the soreness progressed. It was hard to sleep on his left arm. It was like he had been punched. He had to sleep on his right side versus his left side. On 29Jan2021, the muscle soreness at the point of injection spread to his whole body, it was like aches all over his body. The soreness has gotten a little bit better day by day. He confirmed he got a rapid nasal molecular COVID swab test because he was just covering his bases and he tested negative for COVID-19 on 02Feb2021. He also experienced fatigue. The fatigue really started to set in on Friday evening (29Jan2021), it was like he got hit by a truck.  He was typically a high energy person and its very out of the ordinary for him to feel this way. He normally has class on Saturday from 9-noon but he had to cancel going with the amount of fatigue he was experiencing. He also had some cognitive fuzziness on Jan2021. His fatigue was still there, but it has gotten a little better. He was normally very high energy, but he missed two classes and skipped his internship today. He doesn&#39;t feel like himself. He also has had frequent urination which he noticed probably Friday night (29Jan2021), all the way up until now. However, he has been drinking a lot of water. The patient received a test/report showing he has no chromosomal issues and no likelihood of issues on an unspecified date. The outcome of soreness at the point of administration of his left arm and Frequent urination was not recovered; Muscle soreness/muscle soreness at the point of injection spread to his whole body and fatigue was recovering; it was like aches all over his body and cognitive fuzziness was unknown.

I went to urgent care and the symptoms began to diminish, but the doctor prescribed prednisone and antihistamine.

                                                shingles; rash; shoulder pain; little nerve pain thing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 42-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: from vaccine card: EL then either 0 or O 142), via an unspecified route of administration by injection once to left arm on 13Jan2021 at single dose for prevention (covid-19 immunisation).  Medical history was none.  There were no concomitant medications. Patient was diagnosed with shingles about 3 weeks after receiving his first injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. This male consumer received his first injection of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021. He reported being diagnosed with shingles last Thursday (04Feb2021) and stated his symptoms started that same week (Feb2021), which were described as rash and shoulder pain. He reported his shingles are improved and are scabbing over. The consumer was prescribed and was taking valacyclovir for treatment of the shingles. Shingles was now (base on 09Feb2021) healing. Shingles occurred after the first dose, he was not blaming the vaccine, he did fine, he had no reaction, his first dose was on 13Jan2021, and shingles came up last week (on 04Feb2021). The consumer&#39;s second dose of the covid-19 vaccine was supposed to be last week (base on 09Feb2021) but this physician recommended he delay due to the shingles. Currently on an antiviral, getting better, feels great, wondering if he can proceed with second dosage. The consumer was wanting to get his second dose this week (base on 09Feb2021). No investigation Assessment. Outcome: he scabbed up, he never had fever, just a rash and the little nerve pain thing (Feb2021), that&#39;s it. Stated he had no reaction to the vaccine whatsoever. The outcome of shingles was recovering, of other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

A 42-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Lot #: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 (at the age of 42-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not have any known allergies. The patient did not receive any other medications within two weeks prior to the vaccination and did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 30Jan2021 the patient experienced swelling, red spots and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;two weeks after my COVID-19 vaccination I noticed swelling, red spots, and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it. I visited my podiatrist who recommended NSAIDs for a week. Today, my sister in law who is a nurse said it looked like COVID toes. When I googled an image of COVID toes, the spots looked identical to my own.&#34; The adverse events required a physician office visit. The patient received treatment for the events which included NSAIDs. The clinical outcomes of the events swelling, red spots and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it were all not recovered/not resolved. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Patient was normal upon administration. Was given instruction to wait 15 minutes in the pharmacy to monitor for adverse reaction, per protocol. Pharmacy staff was alerted by customer that patient was &#34;not looking good&#34;. As we walked to patient, we slipped out of his chair and appeared to loose consciousness and/or have seizure-like symptoms. Patient looked very pale, perhaps had some minor foam at the mouth and was extremely hot. We stayed by patient, protected his head, allowed him to come to, took coat off and applied ice packs, took BP/pulse (normal) and patient was oriented x3. EMS arrived and took over.

                                                After the required wait period of 15 minutes I started to drive back home which is 77 miles from the hospital that administered the vaccination.  Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

It was around 72 hours in which acute muscle soreness occurred at the injection site on my right deltoid. I thought it would resolve like the first dose after three or four days, but this seem to last longer and then it mysteriously begin to travel down my arm. It seems like every one or two days it went more distal down my right upper extremity. It first went from my deltoid to my bicep and tricep. And then a couple days later it was in my elbow and forearm. Now it has been in my elbow for weeks leaving me with weakness and pain that nothing seems to help improve it. It?s like it is in my joint at my right elbow. There is a very specific soreness and pain which has cost me a significant discomfort and weekend my strength and the entire arm.

                                                I received my first dose of Pfizer vaccine (lot # EN6200) around 10 AM. I was perfectly fine after the shot. However, 6 hours later around 4PM my Left outer ear turned bright red and get itchy (no raised or macular rash, no hives, no signs of insect bites or anything) No other redness or rashes in any other parts of my body. I did not develop any other symptoms (no SOB/difficulty breathing, etc) My R ear is fine too. I observed myself to see if the redness/itchiness will spread but after about an hour or so, the redness and itchiness went away. I did not take any antihistamine and did not I apply any hydrocortisone. Just went away on its own.  Four days later, it happened again, my L outer ear turned red again, this time it is not itchy but more like throbbing pain. It went away after 1-2 hours without any treatment.

A 43-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EP6955), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 15Mar2021 3:00 PM (received at the age of 43-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Attention deficit disorder, cholesterol, benign heart palpitations. He also had a previous reaction to insect bites and followed up with an allergist.  He went over a decade ago for the insect bite, they gave him epinephrine at the urgent care and said to call or come back if it worsened. The next morning, his symptoms from the insect bite were worse and the urgent care told caller to go to the ED (emergency department). Concomitant medications included amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) from an unspecified date and ongoing for Attention deficit disorder; metoprolol from an unspecified date and ongoing for benign heart palpitations; simvastatin from an unspecified date and ongoing for cholesterol; vitamins and minerals; ubiquinol from an unspecified date and ongoing; fish oil from an unspecified date and ongoing. The patient previously had a flu shot in Aug2020. The patient previously took epinephrine and experienced insect bite were worse, and metoprolol and experienced reaction linger. The stated he thought he had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer covid19 vaccine on 15Mar2021.  He states that his tongue was swollen (15 min after receiving the vaccine, at 03:15 PM), he broke out into hives. He was in the restroom of the facility where he received the vaccine and that he did not have hives yet after getting the vaccine, but then asked the nurse if he could take Benadryl and was told yes. He states they then let him go because he had no trouble breathing at that time. He drove home and was going to reroute to hospitals if needed. He took 50 mg fast melt Benadryl as soon as walked out of the facility. He drank water, drank two larger bottles of water.  His chest started to get broken out and got beat red.  He took another 25 mg of Benadryl and then drove home. He then proceeded with Benadryl 50 mg every 6 hours. At 1 AM, the next morning (16Mar2021), he woke up with trouble breathing and tongue swelling and went to ER.  They gave him Prednisone 60 mg and then started on 5 days of prednisone.  They told him to continue Benadryl, and water and to follow up at hospital if worsens and to follow up with his physician. He stated that he had a previous reaction to insect bites and followed up with an allergist. He went over a decade ago for the insect bite, they gave him epinephrine at the urgent care and said to call or come back if it worsened. The next morning, his symptoms from the insect bite were worse and the urgent care told caller to go to the ED.  He added that this experience with the Covid19 vaccine was milder comparatively as they gave him just steroids and not epinephrine this time, and, they told him he was not having trouble breathing this time.  Last night, 16Mar2021, at around 10:30 pm, a half hour before next dose of 6 hour Benadryl was due, his skin was burning itchy and red so he took Benadryl a half hour early and set alarm to wake up before next dose. He woke up 4 hours later and waited to see if he would have a reaction and he has not taken it since. He took the morning dose of Prednisone with improvement and is carrying Benadryl in his pocket just in case. He later clarified that he took his 11 o&#39;clock dose last night and then set a 2:30 am alarm to see if it was worse again or about the same. Regarding the allergic reaction, he first noticed around 3 pm Monday 15Mar2021.  Within 15 minutes after the vaccine, he was going through his phone and thought he felt strange while waiting at (Name) after the vaccine to see if he had a reaction. This feeling continued until 11 pm last night, 16Mar2021.  He took 50 mg of Benadryl when this first happened on 15Mar2021 and then took another 25 mg 15 minutes after the first initial dose.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 44-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EH9899) 1st dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 in the evening time (around 6-7 or maybe a little later) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the COVID Vaccine that same day, his heart rate went up and then it came down and he was fine. Later that night while sleeping he got up again because he could feel his heart rate going up. It was not way up, but he could tell it was up. He was trying to catch an actual reading on the monitor of his heart rate, but he was not able to before it came back down. He was calling because he is wondering if this was considered a severe allergic reaction. He got the vaccine and was able to walk to his car. His mouth got dry right after the vaccine within a minute or two and noticed his heart rate went up. Treatment: He took some deep breaths and drunk water and it got better. He drove home, but that at nighttime while sleeping he noticed his heart rate went up a couple of times, but then it came back down. He could not get a reading of heart rate right away. The highest he saw on the monitor that he was able to capture was 101 and then it came back down. He was not sure if this was because he was nervous. He just had a couple of episodes that night and then nothing again. He also experienced his arm being sore from the vaccination. However, he stated that is to be expected. He stated the arm sore started a few days after getting the COVID Vaccine and then it was gone. Stated he was calling because he was concerned because Pfizer said to report any issues. He started to feel better and added this may not even be an issue. He just got concerned. Mentioned he was not sure if real side effects or if he was over thinking things. Outcome of the events was resolved.

A 44-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at a single dose on the left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 28Dec2020. Since receiving the vaccine, he has experienced multiple side effects at varying time points: pain at injection site left shoulder (experienced pain first day of receiving vaccine on 28Dec2020 and couple of days after fever (unspecified date) resolved (on an unspecified date); he was currently experiencing intermittent minimal pain especially when he wakes up; feels something is different; fever (experienced 08Jan2021); fatigue (developed 07Jan2021). He went to the ER on 08Jan2021 when he developed fever, nausea and shortness of breath which also resolved that day. When he went to ER, his CRP was up a little at 1.1. His PCR and antigen test was negative at that time (08Jan2021); a retest of PCR done 5 days after sxs started (unclear of time window) was negative. He was concerned that he had the fever many days after the vaccine. HCP was asking if any cases of fever and fatigue reported after 7 days (around the 10 day mark) of receiving the first dose. He stated that he is planning on taking the second dose. The patient is a physician calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. He received his first dose on 28Dec2020. He had a little bit of pain in his left arm on same day, but it went away. About 10 days later, 07Jan2021, he had fever and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, he went to the ER with a temp of 101. He had tachycardia, nausea and shortness of breath. He was not admitted, stated his fever was controlled and his breathing was better. His oxygen was 100% and everything was ok and he was sent home. In the ER he had xrays and labs and everything was ok, except his CRP was a bit up. In the ER he had an antigen and pcr covid test (08Jan2021) and they both came back negative. About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date. Outcome of nausea and shortness of breath was recovered on 08Jan2021, while outcome of pain at injection site left shoulder was recovered on 28Dec2020. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Left arm pain that starts  at the injection site from the second shot and then radiates down the length of the arm to the fingers causes the pinky and ring fingers to go numb . This started about 2-3 weeks after the second vaccination right after the bruise at the injection site resolved. It gets worse if I use the arm a lot . It also hurts if I don&#39;t use the arm too but not as frequently. I have demonstrably less strength in the pinky and ring fingers when comparing left to right hand. I went to the doctor and have been referred to a neurologist but the earliest appointment available is in April. No treatment for the pain was initiated until evaluation from the neurologist in April.  The pain is getting worse and the numbness in the fingers is getting worse as well as time progresses to the point  it is interfering with sleep and normal activities.

It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At about 29-30 hours, noticed mild numb feeling along right jawline from middle of mouth to right ear, and around the right ear. By morning (about 48 hours post vaccination), numb feeling appears gone on right jawline, but seems to have moved to left jawline (still mild). No trouble breathing or eating at all. Consulted primary care doctor out of concern over odd sensation, but not treatments at this time. Considering taking a benadryl tablet just to see if it has any effect.

A 45-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3247) intramuscular on the right arm on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications included supplements and vitamins. The patient got the COVID Vaccine on the 21st of January the Pfizer one and the following day he felt fine but he has this weird rash on that arm on his forearm, on the top of the elbow and then he kind of started on the other arm and then on the legs a little bit, around his belly and then his tongue looked like he has swollen taste buds or something, but he said he felt fine but the reporter don&#39;t if that&#39;s a side effect. &#34;Should he be worried, should he go to a doctor?&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;Because we weren&#39;t sure what it was, he did take one Benadryl like the ones you find at the drug store and then that was it. And then I put Calamine lotion, so topically couple times just to prevent him from scratching but not regularly just when he feels really, really itchy.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

A 45-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 01Apr2021 (Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and  concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 01Apr2021 and experienced a raging rash 24 hours later (02Apr2021), still had the rash, he was due for second dose on 23Apr2021. He&#39;s had this rash 13 plus days. The rash started on his right arm, not the arm where he received the Covid 19 vaccine. The rash was super itchy, super annoying. The rash did spread to his other arm. He did see his doctor as soon as he could. His doctor told him maybe the rash was related to the Covid 19 vaccine, maybe it&#39;s herpes zoster, maybe it&#39;s contact dermatitis, it&#39;s probably not the Covid 19 vaccine. His primary care doctor prescribed him a topical steroid, Clobetasol and Benadryl for itching. He then saw a dermatologist. The dermatologist took a closer look and decided to prescribe an oral steroid, Prednisone, he&#39;s on his second day of taking the Prednisone. The dermatologist told him to get the second Covid 19 vaccine even if his rash isn&#39;t resolved by then but the first doctor her saw said he might need to worry about anaphylaxis. That&#39;s scary. He wanted to get the second Covid 19 vaccine. He stated maybe his body started making all these T-cells the next thing he knew he had this rash.  He stated his PCP and dermatologist advised him to call Pfizer regarding the treatment of his rash, he wanted Pfizer to recommend what to do to get rid of the rash. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I have never had a seizure in my life before or since, but that morning I had five partial focal seizures in y right arm, over the course of six minutes.  As I was on the phone (to report the first one to my caregiver) when the second hit, I inadvertently punched myself rapidly and repeatedly in the right side of my head, with the phone handset functioning as an impromptu bludgeon, leaving bruises reminiscent of the victim of a fist fight.  Also at the time I had a strong headache, cold chills, a 102 degree Fahrenheit fever and body aches.  None of which persisted beyond noon.

In the evening of the same day, around 7h30 PM while I was sitting on a table talking to my parents, I had a nosebleed, not very bad, just about 10 drops of blood. I had not had nosebleed for  8 or 10 years before that night. I thought it might be because of the dryness in my house, humidity dropped to 30%  from the normal range of 40%-60%. However, last night (Tuesday night) around the same time 7:00pm ~ 7:30pm, I had a nosebleed again while having dinner with my family, a bit less blood dropping this time, but it makes me worried a little bit.    Other than the nosebleed, I don&#39;t have any other symptoms, the soreness on the injection arm is close to nothing and I usually forgot about it.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 46-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 12:15 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient reported that he felt fine after the shot for the rest of the day and the first night other than the soreness where he received the shot. The patient went to bed around 11 pm and woke up the next day (14Jan2021) at around 6:30 am with very bad dizziness. He felt like his eyes were rolling around in his head which made him very nauseous and sick to his stomach. His wife called a friend who is a nurse and she said to keep an eye on him for a little while and see how he was in an hour or so. She said that if it gets worse call 911 otherwise get him to the clinic at 10 am. He reported that he was feeling much better by then but went to clinic at 10 and doctor saw him asked questions gave me something for nausea and dizziness. He felt good the rest of the day with slight lightheaded. He mentioned that he needs get his second shot on 03Feb2021 and was concerned about getting it. He inquired on what is the recommendation on getting dose #2. It was not reported if the patient been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received treatment for the adverse events. They gave me ondansetron (ZAFRAN ODT [orally disintegrating tablets]) 4 mg for nausea. The patient considered the events was non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date with sequelae (recovered with lasting effects).

At 06:00 (Friday), I woke with a massive pressure headache, malaise, very sore left arm (where the injection was), and a fever of 100.2. Tylenol at 06:20 seems to have broken fever, still feel very rundown and the headache is debilitating.  It is 10:00 hrs. as I fill this out. The Tylenol made no difference to the headache.

January 9  - ER - Diagnosed cellulitis - round of Ceflex for a week - things got worse. Since January 9, I&#39;ve had two other separate ER visits and three rounds of CEFLEX. Was referred to Dermatology - Arrhythmia Nodusem  - so now I&#39;m off Ceflex and on a steroid regimen now. I just started it today. It hurts to even touch my skin and it hurts to walk.I&#39;m in  a lot of pain. I have no open wounds so no reason for this to happen.

Thursday, March 18th, no change red bumps appear to be spreading.  Friday, March 19th, red bumps appear to be spreading and more prevalent in left groin area, bumps appear to be travelling down left arm towards direction of left hand.  Bumps are not that itchy, but do have an occasional itchiness on a scale of 1 to 10, about a 1 or 2 with itch.  Per the recommendation of Urgent Care, I am taking Benadryl, but only taking one pill at night before bedtime and there appears to be no improvement.

                                                Woke up next morning at 7am with itching hands, slight swelling in lips and ears, nausea and diarrhea. Itching and swelling subsided with a dose of Loratadine. Nausea worsened that night and vomiting ensued with diarrhea worsening. At bedtime, itching returned, sleeplessness, vomiting and sweating profusely from the scalp and face, slight difficulty filling lungs with air. Another dose of Loratadine calmed symptoms. Wednesday (10th) through the next Thursday (18th ), nausea persisted, but eased with Benadryl and Emerton. Diarrhea persisted through Monday (15th). No fever, no soreness, no headache.

As the days have gone on it?s gotten a little worse. Left under arm pain, armpit area, left chest (pectoral) pain. Just lingering pain. Very sensitive to the touch. I also developed a rash on the left side of my spine between the shoulder blades. It  showed up this past weekend or the end of last week. It?s more of a painful rash than itchy. It?s very uncomfortable to lean against or lay on.  This is all 13 days after the second shot. I have just been taking ibuprofen for the pain.  Going to see my doctor today.

The next day around lunch time the hives came back again I had a very red and tingling area around my neck and in my head. I returned to the walk in clinic and they gave me shot of Benadryl and prednisone and another drug I do not remember.

Narrative:  12/21 employee received vaccine at 0930 - later in the afternoon he noted tachycardia to about 100. He was watching the rate on his Apple watch. The highest rate was 130. His only other symptom was fatigue which was bad enough on 12/22 that he had to go home. He saw his PCP on 12/22 for the tachycardia who ordered labs which were all normal. He is a resident so he asked anesthesia to do an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia. On 12/23 his heart rate average went down to 100. Today (12-28) his resting heart rate is 70-80 which is his baseline. He has not had recurrence of the tachycardia since 12/23. He also reports he had soreness at the injection site and myalgias both of which have since resolved.

A 47-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), unknown on 18Dec2020 (lot number: EK5730) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Caller is a Physician Assistant. Caller states that she is calling about the Covid Vaccine. She had a patient received his first dose of the vaccine on Friday 18Dec2020, 3 days later on 21Dec2020 he had an urticarial rash that persisted, The urticarial rash was treated with prednisone and resolved by 27Dec2020, it has not reoccurred. The allergist said it was a delayed hyper sensitive reaction that was Prompted by the immune simulation from the vaccine. The Patient was treated for the urticaria.  Caller would like to know if a patient experienced an allergic reaction to the first dose is there anything prophylactically needing to be done when administering the second dose of the Covid vaccine? Caller is very upset and frustrated and stating she wants to speak to someone that is a clinician with the clinical trial team who can give her recommendations for a specific patient. Caller asks if they should do Prophylaxis with antihistamines for the second dose. He did not have anaphylaxis but he had angioedema. Caller states that she did a Vaers report on 22Dec2020, but no one contacted her. He started taking Zyrtec and Vistaril. The Allergist said it was fine and he will still need the 2nd Booster Dose. The Angioedema started on 22Dec2020, it was also treated with prednisone, in addition to being administered Benadryl IM, and Vistaril. The outcome of the event urticarial rash was recovered on 27Dec2020 and Angioedema was recovered on 22Dec2020.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                Background, I had Covid back at the end of May/beginning of June with 1 week of constant fevers (with 500mg tylenol q6), shortness of breath, fatigue, but no real cough. O2 sats somtimes in low 90&#39;s . I am one of the radiology faculty at the hospital I work at. Received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday Dec 18 at about 21:30. After the injection, I had moderate pain at the site of injection about 6 hours later, not unexpected. However, the next evening, I was feeling fatigued and went to bed at about 7 p.m. For the next three hours, I felt chills and finally at about 10 p.m. I took my temp after I felt that my fever had &#34;broke&#34; and temp was 101.9. Used a finger pulse ox just to make sure sats were ok, they were at 97%, but unexpectedly, resting heart rate was 130 bpm. I took some tylenol and called the ER, and they suggested calling the covid hotline pager and coming in if I did not improve. I called the hotline pager, and we discussed things and eventually decided that I should go to the ER as temp remained at 101.6. By the time I reached the ER, my temp was down to 100.8, but pulse still 122 (EKG with no other abnormalities) and BP was 165/100. I had no other symptoms to account another infection. Over the next two hours, vitals became more normal with HR down to 95 to 100, and BP down to 145/85 or so without any other intervention.  Sunday, still with some mild low grade temps of 99.8, but heart rate at 85 to 90 (I&#39;m usually at about 80).   In the ER, we came to the conclusion that my body mounted a significant immune response to the production of antigens after processing the mRNA given the lack of alternative diagnosis and the improvement of sx without any other intervention besides the 500 mg of tylenol I took before coming in.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EL0142) intramuscularly at right shoulder approximately at 17:30 on 29Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity (a little over weight but he is fit). The patient had COVID in the end of Apr2020. The patient had no family medical history and had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no concomitant medication. The second day of the vaccination, the patient called to report body aches, headache, chills, low grade temperature. As he reported, he just woke up and was walking around feeling like he had 1000 pounds on his back and felt like crap. The body aches started in his shoulder and currently all over his neck, back and whole body aches. Chills started last night (vaccination night). He was just trying to get to sleep and had to put an extra sweatshirt on last night. He did not check his temperature until he got up and it was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit. He was not able to provide a start date for the temperature. &#34;Body aches, headache between, chills between, low grade temperature (unspecified start date), feels like crap&#34; were considered developing between 24:00-01:00. He stated that they were all medically significant and he needs a day to recover hopefully. He just felt like he was hit by a truck. The patient had not visited physician or went to ER yet. The outcome of low grade temperature was unknown, chills was resolving and all other events did not resolve at the time of reporting.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events vaccination site pain, headache, chills, and pyrexia were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. The association between the other reported events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded based on temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 24 hours post shot I experienced severe joint pain in most all joints.  Shortly after onset of joint pain experienced severe chills.  Those symptoms persisted for approximately 12 hours after which I continued to experience injection site pain, but began to experience pain with some numbness that radiated from the injection site distally down my arm and into my pinky and ring fingers on my left hand.  No other symptoms.  As of today the injection site pain persists as does the pain and numbness in my pinky and ring fingers, but I get the feeling that it is getting slightly worse.  The pain and slight numbness is present when I awake, but gets worse throughout the day.  Some evenings there is considerable discomfort.

This is the first of two reports.  This physician which was a 49-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on the right deltoid 17Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated that he received the first dose of the COVID vaccine and he had a pretty bad rash that started 3 days after (noted on 20Dec2020). The rash has since improved since it started but it took forever to improve and mentioned that he was super itchy at night. He also used to be itchy in the day, but now it was just at nigh which was driving him insane. The physician also mentioned that it was a raised maculopapular rash. It started on his neck on the left side as well and increased of both elbows and behind his knees (it was diffuse). He mentioned that he was able to carry on during the day, but he cannot sleep great. He mentioned that it reminded him of poison ivy - the thought of it happening again makes him want to cringe especially with all the terrible stuff he has seen he was scared that his skin will slough off or its going to kill him or something. But overall, he was more concerned about the itching. The physician took over the counter antihistamines and hydrocortisone cream. He did take one dose of expired liquid prednisone (from 5 years ago that his daughter who had for an ear infection). He downed a sip of prednisone and it prevented his itchiness for a day and now was thinking of getting on steroids. The physician also stated that there was one guy he worked with had something similar (AER 2021010285). He received the same lot number and has been itching like crazy. They have both been trying to figure out what to do. It was clear as mud. Then, last week (Jan2021) they saw each other, and they were both having the same issue and suffering separately. They had no exposure to anything similar besides the vaccine. The physician stated that he was about due for 2nd shot. He has been researching and trying to figure out what to do, if he should get the second dose or not. He reported this to VAERs and talked to CDC, but nobody has any recommendations or information. He also tried to look up trial data to see if anyone had reported a similar rash, and he did not find anything. He was calling to see if he should get the second dose, and if Pfizer has any information on this rash being reported. Outcome of pruritic rash was not recovered; recovering from maculopapular rash and unknown for the remaining event. As per causality: He was unsure. It was most likely from the vaccine as he has done nothing differently.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

Tuesday evening, my wife noticed that I am not fully blinking/closing my right eye; Feb 17, 2021 Wednesday, I didn&#39;t have the same pain but there&#39;s numbness on my right cheek extending to my right lips.  Wednesday afternoon around 2pm, I went to my dentist thinking it was due to my Invisalign which I started on Jan 25, 2021.  The dentist told me it is most likely Bell&#39;s palsy so I decided to go to Emergency.

                                                Early Wednesday morning (2/24) around 5:00AM, I woke up to extreme pain in my left arm, primarily along the upper forearm, inside of my elbow, and lower bicep. There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They&#39;ve prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week. The right arm pain is less than the left arm pain, but at this point seven days later, I am experiencing neuropathic pain in both arms.

I also felt like I had a bit of a lump in my throat. I called the Doctor&#39;s office and spoke with a nurse who suggested I take Benadryl.  I did so at around midnight and that seemed to take care of things.  Went to bed and woke up the next morning feeling ok (though groggy from the Benadryl).

A 49-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported) via unspecified route of administration in the arm right on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced drug allergy; also received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EJ1685) via unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: clinic. It was reported that on 23Jan2021, couple of days after the second shot, patient experienced skin on hands and the bottom of my feet started to peel off and bleeding and very painful in the fingers and the feet.  The events resulted in both: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and Emergency room/department or urgent care. It was unknown if treatment received for the events. Outcome of all events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship and known drug profile, a contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded in the development of bleeding, skin exfoliation and pain in extremity.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He also complained that despite his protest, the person who administered the shot insisted to inject on his shoulder joint.  He developed a bigger-than-quarter-size bruise on his right inner arm the next day. He was feeling tired the following days. On May 4 around 3:30, I heard he was making loud noises. I came to his side immediately. At the time I thought he was making louder than usual snores. I nudged him gently but he didn&#39;t respond.  After about 15 seconds, the sound stopped, and he had no breath. I then called 911 within 10 seconds, tried to do CPR on him. It took EMS 6 minutes to arrive even though we live very close to a fire station in a well-accessed urban area. EMS worked on him for about 30 minutes before transported him to hospital. They continued to work on him for a while. He never regained breath.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

After the dose was administered the patient experienced tachycardia (pulse 110), elevated BP (measured with arm cuff at ~180/120), headache, and warmth. The patient was offered a cold pack, given water, and was taken away to a secluded room to relax under supervision. After about 1.5 hours the patient improved (BP 120/76 and pulse 85). The patient informed me that his rheumatologist recently had him stop his treatments for Crohn&#39;s disease in preparation to receive the vaccine. He stated that he had similar symptoms before when trying different treatment regimens for his underlying condition. The patient left on his own and no further adverse effects were reported.

I had Covid in March 2020 and the feeling was similar without the coughing and much shorter timeframe.  That continued until about 3am on Thursday March 18 when I thought I was almost back to normal.   When I woke up at 6am I thought I was ok but then I realized I had a lump under my left armpit on my side seemingly like my lymph node is swollen.  That continues as I write this at 341pm on Friday March 19.  I also developed hives on my right bicep and on my left and right buttocks and left and right hamstrings.  this is itchy.  I no longer have the soreness, sweating or fatigue but i have the swollen and what seems to be allergic reaction symptoms of hives.

A 50-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 50-year-old, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 25Mar2021 19:00 (Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to spring pollen, oak birch, and ash. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) and levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) taken as allergy medication. On 25Mar2021, the patient got the shot, waited 15 minutes, no problems. On 26Mar2021, woke up to a very very red face. On 27Mar2021, massive facial angioedema, fatigue, itching, notable penis redness, his penis was also &#34;sheet red&#34; and swollen. The patient started 4mg prednisolone on 27Mar2021, kept facial swelling and allergies at bay, mostly, but a very close rate to not keeping up. On 02Apr2021, swelling subsided and mostly was getting back to &#34;normal&#34;, however lips were flaking, skin flaking. On 04Apr2021-week of, things got better, very swollen lips but everything reasonably in check. On 12Apr2021, the face re-firing red at approx 1pm, slept until 6pm, and complete relapse of allergy/angioedema. Trip to Emergency room (ER), given shot of Kenelog in the arm, released. On 13Apr2021, no improvement, steroids ended 6 days after the patient started taking them, 2nd trip to ER with epinephrine shot, no improvement; blood taken, white blood cell count normal.

On 26Apr2021 starts up again, mild, contact me. The patient doesn&#39;t know what to do with the second vaccine in general and he had called and they say no on him getting number 2. He was terrified of vaccines now because of his reaction. He also says that he was not hospitalized but he went to the emergency room twice. The patient would like to know if there have been any reports of those who had a similar reaction to this getting the second dose of the vaccine and how they reacted. He states that he has been told that he should not get the second dose but wonders if he were to get another COVID-19 vaccine other than Pfizer, if he would have the same reaction. The event allergic to something in the shot/systemic histamine reaction resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The event massive facial angioedema/ complete relapse of allergy/angioedema resulted to emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with steroids for the events. The outcome of the event massive facial angioedema/complete relapse of allergy/angioedema was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovering.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

In 4 days subsided.   Day 7 experienced ear flushing and warmth that last 3 days and subsided.    Saw a neurologist to rule out nerve damage.   EMG was normal.   ANA titer was 1:40 with speckled and cytoplasma pattern.   My last ANA was negative when tested for inflammation due to back pain few years prior.     Neurologist  did not think this was an allergic reaction and since symptoms were gradually improving recommended second dose.   Symptoms fully resolved after 2 weeks  Dose 2 - Jan 19 , 2021 (21 days post) -  Decided to inject left deltoid to avoid trauma to right arm.     Was observed 30 mins and released.   No symptoms.     Moderate arm soreness x 4 days.   Day 3 post injection developed burning eye discomfort, intermittent tingling sensation in arm, warm/cold sensations.   Pain radiating to shoulder and neck.   Day 6  started very mild tingling and warm sensations in in cheek and chin area.

I hit my head on a chair when I was falling and cut my head. I stayed laying down because I was still dizzy and hot. They called the squad and did vitals and I was fine. I sat there for about another half an hour and I went home. I have felt fine ever since. Only thing that hurt was my head from the fall.

Headache lasted until I went to bed that night took Tylenol throughout the day with occasional mild help but not much. Took my temperature it was 98.8 I usually run around 96/97  It got up to 98.8 later that morning. As the day progressed my muscles ached and I had very little  energy.  I napped a little but otherwise was just planted on the couch.   The headache was the most annoying and steady.   All symptoms were gone when I woke the next morning.  My temp today is 97.7 and that?s a little higher than normal and my head still feels a little warm when  someone else feels it and I feel still a tad warmer than normal.   Otherwise I feel pretty good.

                                                Shortly after receiving the injection my arm went ice cold all the way to my fingers and warmed up again quickly. On the way home (about an hour later) I noticed numbness and tingling in my hand and that has continued since (11 days as of this report). My upper arm muscle was sore later that evening and by the next day the pain in my upper arm was extreme. I couldn&#39;t move my arm without extreme pain. I took some tylenol late in the day and that did help cut down on some of the pain. I also put an ice pack on my upper arm but it didn&#39;t help. The pain wasn&#39;t as bad the next (3rd) day but it&#39;s still significant enough for me to restrict activity with it. There is also a burning sensation off and on as well as itching deep in my arm. My upper arm has also felt like there is a tight band around it (since day 2) although the muscles themselves don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s any tightness or knots. I took ibuprofen on day 10 and it helped a little but not a whole lot. At this point I also have what feels like swelling or tenderness under my arm near the armpit area. The pain, burning and itching in my upper arm continues as well as the numbness, tingling and pins all up and down my arm to my hand and fingers.

He said he had some pain at the injection site and mild headache in the afternoon; however, around 12 to 1 am in the morning, he was feeling heart palpitation and he felt his muscle twitching from his upper torso which went down to his thigh and no loss of consciousness.  He said he checked his heart rate and it was 70 and he did not have any problems breathing.  He said his heart palpitation felt better after taking some deep breaths.  He said he no longer had heart palpitations or muscle twitching any more.  He denied any other symptoms.   Generally, he appeared well, no facial drooping, awake, alert, oriented, speech clear, and normal gait. (Today)

My fever was 102.8 when I first woke up. I was very nauseous and my fever felt worse. My thermometer would not read any more until my temp came down. I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

From about 24 hours for maybe the next 4 days, significant aggravation of legacy rashes from my chronic skin conditions.  After 4 days, they reverted to normal.

He said it felt and looked similar to a mild sunburn and was quite itchy. He said it didn&#39;t bother him but wanted to tell me about it. It resolved 4 days after shot and he did not take any medication to help it. He did comment that he is allergic to penicillin, and that he had many issues with allergies/hives as a child. He carried an epi-pen as a child as well.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

                                                Right after vaccine administered, I noticed that the injection site seemed a bit high and more in my shoulder than my upper arm. Did not think  much more of it until pain started about four hours later then at 0130 in the morning awoke with much throbbing in arm such that I took 600mg ibuprofen in order to sleep.  The site remains very tender to touch not warm or red and the injection site is just under my left acromion process shoulder area.  I work in the ED and must use this arm for airway management procedures.  Fortunately I am off clinical duties until Tuesday, Jan. 19, so hopefully pain will subside by then, but I do not think I could intubate anyone in my current state.  I do not think this is a reaction to the vaccine per se but  more so a result of the site of injection in my tendon/bursa area of my shoulder. At this time, I cannot move my left shoulder without pain.  I am trying to perform ROM exercises to hopefully reduce the time of discomfort overall. I also have some vague sense of radiation down my forearm into my left pinky finger ulnar distribution.

I had a dripping sweat occur at the five to fifteen minute range. There was a flushing sensation during this. After a few minutes, it all abaited. The bandaid was saturated with blood.  My arm was never sore and I had zero symptoms after the initial reaction. I believe this injection was given intravascularly.  I have not been able to find ANY information to address the effectiveness of this route if administration and I seriously fear that I am not covered.

My skin has become very patchy (&amp; dried-out) in some of those certain areas as well.  And, I?ve just been overall EXTREMELY itchy in those rash areas....nothing like this I?ve ever experienced prior to my vaccine on Feb 12th, 2021.

                                                I ate nothing that morning of the shot. The first day:  I took the covid-19 vaccine Pfizer shot on Thursday the 4th of March; there was pain at the injection site just as any other vaccine I have been administered during military service.  After the shot I felt tied, and my left arm did hurt from the shot, I started to feel irritable (angry or even aggressive), my chest became tight and my heart rhyme felt somewhat off causing me to start coughing and sometimes uncontrollable to the point I could not catch my breath I thought about seeking medical attention but did not..  The second day:  Pain in my left arm went away at the injection site, tiredness went away, and the feeling of irritable (angry or even aggressiveness) went away, tightness in my chest and coughing went away. I have been having a chronic pain in my left arm for about a year and after the shot the pain was gone I noticed that on the second day. I did notice my body temperature was up and down showing symptoms of histamine reaction but not out of control.

The next night after eating Tuna I had the tongue swelling again with some Tachycardia and a severe headache with red welts all over my body. I also had tightness in my throat. I went to the Urgent Care where they gave me Antihistamine, Prednisone, something for headache and IV Fluids.  I was discharged after three hours and felt better within a few hours. I took Prednisone for five days.

                                                Ankles started itching like he had mosquito bites / itching was out of control; Hives on ankles, hands, trunk, stomach, back, front, feet / hives all over; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer reporting on behalf of her husband. A 53 years old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot ER2613, expiry date Jul2021) on 05Apr2021 at around 16:00, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given within 4 weeks. Medical history included cold sores. Concomitant medication included valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX) 1 g, 2 tablets when felt cold sore coming on, for cold sores. The patient took Valtrex just once in a while when he got cold sores, since probably 7-8 years ago. On 05Apr2021 at around 19:00 patient ankles started itching like he had mosquito bites. Hives started on the patient&#39;s ankles on 05Apr2021, then spread a little on his hands and a little on his trunk. Throughout the night of 05Apr2021, hives started appearing on his trunk, his stomach a little bit and some on his back. Over the course of 06Apr2021 to 07Apr2021, the hives spread to the patient&#39;s front, back, hands and feet. The patient worked most of 06Apr2021 and 07Apr2021 and the hives and the itching continued to get worse. The patient had more hives on 06Apr2021 and on 07Apr2021 he had hives all over. The patient&#39;s whole body was filled with hives. By 07Apr2021 night, the patient&#39;s itching was out of control and he couldn&#39;t hardly stand it. The events required physician office visit (urgent care for hives on 07Apr2021) and also emergency room during the night of 07Apr2021 and again on 08Apr2021 morning at 06:00. Caller reported that she and the patient just got back from the emergency room. The patient was starting to itch again. He lasted about 4 hours after getting home last night, 07Apr2021, and then went back to emergency room on 08Apr2021 morning. Nothing had really helped the patient&#39;s itching and hives. The medications took a little of the edge off of the patient&#39;s itching. They gave the patient an IV at the emergency room visit on 08Apr2021, but he was starting to itch again. The patient received a prescription for prednisone from urgent care (he had to take 60 mg  the first day, 60 mg the second day, and then taper down over 6 days). When the patient finally got the prescription for prednisone filled and the patient was finally able to take the prednisone, he was going crazy from the extreme itching. The patient hadn&#39;t eaten and ended up getting sick from the prednisone. First emergency room visit: the patient received a shot of diphenhydramine 50 mg at 11:33 PM and methylprednisolone sodium 125 mg at 11:36 PM on 07Apr2021. The emergency room gave the patient a prescription for doxepin 10 mg every night for 7 days to help the patient relax and so that he could sleep, but they were unable to have the prescription filled last night as the pharmacy was closed. The patient was given a dose of 10 mg of doxepin to go home with so that he could sleep. Second emergency room visit: the patient received diphenhydramine 50 mg injection at 7:54 AM, 20 mg of famotidine at 7:21 AM, 60 mg methylprednisolone at 7:19 AM, and a 500 mL bolus of sodium chloride 0.9% at 7:56 AM on 08Apr2021. The patient was sent home with prescriptions for hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg, 1 capsule by mouth three times daily as needed for up to 5 days and famotidine 20 mg, 1 tablet by mouth twice daily for 5 days. Hydroxyzine, famotidine, diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone and doxepin had not really helped the patient&#39;s hives and itching. The patient was still trying to recover at the time of report.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 53-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 53-year-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Apr2021 11:15 (Lot Number: EW0153) at 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. The patient received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included famotidine (PEPCID AC).  The patient previously took flu shot in Oct2020, prilosec [omeprazole magnesium] for seasonal allergy and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced unexpected bruising near injection site. Bruise was the size of the bandaid, approximately 1&#34; x 2&#34;. Bruising had persisted for more than a week now. The patient had never experienced bruising like this with other vaccines. He would like to rule out possible thrombosis reaction before second shot. He did not have bruising at any other locations other than the injection site.  Bruise was purple and red splotches and has now progressed to mostly yellow. He believed the discoloration was a reaction to the vaccine and not the result of the needle. The shot itself was painful but patient felt minimal pain/stiffness following the shot. The event start date was on 20Apr2021. No treatment was received. The outcome was unknown.

The second night the symptoms returned around 11:00 and persisted until morning.  They went away with more Tylenol and all but the injection site pain did not return. On the second dose I had the same symptoms The same night as injection.  They did not go away with Tylenol, and continued through the entire next day.  Fever never broke.

He complained of an itchy forehead, which we began to monitor.  He then felt thickness of the base of the tongue, tingling of the lips.  He was given an oral dose of 25mg of Bendryl.  We began to monitor his pulse ox levels.  He remained at 98-99 sat on room air.  His heart rate ranged from 60-68.  He then experienced more itching of the arms, and continued itching of the forehead, thickness of the tongue.  A second oral dose of 25mg Benedryl was given.  After continual monitoring for 45 minutes his symptoms began to subside.  After another 15 minutes he felt his symptoms had resolved.  His final pulse/ox reading was 99% with a pulse of 67.  He was instructed to follow up with his PCP.  He was also instructed to monitor himself for further symptoms.  ER protocols given.  He left on his own.

I immediately administered Benadryl &amp; contacted his primary care physician Dr. We spoke to the on call doctor for Dr. and she said Benadryl should clear up the hives, but if conditions worsen she would prescribe an Rx for steroids. Rx for Steroids were submitted to our local  pharmacy, but we haven?t picked up as of yet. As of this evening, my husband?s hives continue to be inflamed and he?s been taking Benadryl as directed every 4-6 hours.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base.

This 55-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in his left arm on 05Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Arthritis, Sinus problem, Asthma, Bipolar disorder. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date at age of 55 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced injection site pain, severe pain in his left shoulder after that second dose. Some major pain up around his shoulders and around the back of neck, his left side was worst. He said that the pain was shooting down to his heart. So he went to the hospital because he thought it was something to the heart. They tested him, they evaluated him but they ruled out anything that has to do with the heart. They checked his heart, he had a cardiac catheterization, and was ruled out, everything came out negative.  So, he just got out of hospital and was still developing the pain and it&#39;s on his left side, it&#39;s on his right side (as reported). He called all his doctors, they had no answers for him, now he was still in a lot of pain in both of shoulders like he was saying his left side was still the worst, and it has not gone away and the pain is still shooting down around his heart and shooting down around the back of neck and now it&#39;s going on the top of his legs.  He went to the bone doctor and he was getting an MRI done, because the doctors said nothing was torn in his arms or tissues. He stated the pain was around his arms, back and wraps down to the heart. He was in dire pain, 8.5/10 and had a feeling of it was related to the vaccine. He clarified the pain was in both shoulders and the left side was worse and that was the side he had his shot on.  Patient stated he had stomach problems, he was collapsed stomach. The outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I did not experience any adverse symptoms with the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with the exception of injection site pain after the first dose that began on day 2 through day 5 or for 3 days.  The first Pfizer-BioNTech dose was received on December 30, 2020, LOT EK5730. I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS on 12/31/20.  Please note that I completed the same pretreatment protocol 1.5 hours prior to dosing with Pfizer-BioNTech of Diphenhydramine 25 mg plus Pepcid 20 mg for both COVID-19 doses.  I elected to complete a self-administered pretreatment protocol due to a shellfish allergy and literature reports of anaphylaxis with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in food allergy recipients.  I did not experience any adverse symptoms on Saturday afternoon after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at 4:45pm on 1/23/21.  On Sunday morning 1/24/21, I awoke feeling &#34;cold.&#34;  I dressed warmly, but the feeling progressed to chills by 3pm.  Malaise ensued around 1pm.  I also experienced injection site pain on the morning of 1/24/21 beginning at 7am.  The pain lasted until 1/25/21.  I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS ON 1/24/21.   I began to feel uncomfortable with malaise and chills at 6:15pm on 1/24/21 and self-administered one dose of OTC Aleve, Naproxen sodium 220mg plus one dose of Benadryl 25 mg.  I began to feel better by 9pm on 1/24/21.  I awoke on 1/25/21 without any symptoms or discomfort with the exception of some injection site pain (2 out of 10 on VAS).  I have been asymptomatic since 1/26/21.

                                                I was symptom free when I went to bed four hours after vaccination.  In the middle of that first night (03/02/21), I awoke with an overall body ache, which persisted through the next day.  In the morning of the next day (03/03/21), I awoke with soreness at the vaccination site, tightness in my chest, and a swollen, red left ankle.  The overall achiness and sore arm were understandable, but the chest tightness made we wonder if inflammation in the region persisted from my cardiac ablation in May 2020 and was aggravated by the covid vaccine.  I have a Kardia home-test ECG monitor, and the results of the test continue to be &#34;normal.&#34;  As far as the ankle, an MRI in August 2020 determined that I had torn my peroneal brevis tendon.  After six weeks in a walking boot, I began physical therapy and noticed that if I exerted myself too much that I would get swelling and soreness.  Everything in my ankle was healed by October 2020, and I have been hiking / running four times a week since without incident.  I did not injure myself before the vaccination, so it seems to much of a coincidence that inflammation returned to my previously injured ankle just hours after receiving the covid vaccine.

                                                First injection - only a sore right deltoid (injection site).  Fairly intense but only lasted 24 hours and easily alleviated by Tylenol. Second injection - Ringing in my ears - noticeable starting about 9pm the day of the second injection (3/11/21) and it&#39;s still going strong.  Intensity of ringing has remained constant to date unfortunately.  Headache was minor and on &amp; off starting the night of the injection date and appear to still encounter them but intensity has been low.  Taken Tylenol to alleviate symptom with success.  Soreness at injection site - less intense on second shot than first but it lasted about 48 hours.  The Tylenol I took for the headache seemed to help with the arm pain.  On the day after the injection, my right latissimus dorsi (same side as shot) became sore but only for about 24 hours. Tiredness - didn&#39;t feel the exhaustion until about 9pm on the day of the injection.  Exhaustion/tiredness set in more than expected so very low activity the day after and went to bed several hours earlier than normal.  Still feeling tired but emerging from that as i&#39;m starting to feel more energy come back.

At first I thought it might be scratches/irritation from sharp edges on a torn leather sofa, but more red welts appeared in unrelated locations: chest and back.  I have had childhood chickenpox, and have also considered stress as a possible trigger for shingles, but that seems remote to me.

Patient reported prior to the start of the session he received his first COVID vaccine on 03/16/2021 and the proceeding 24-48 hours following had nausea, diarrhea, fever, and increased redness, swelling, and warmth of the right arm.  Patient had a recent right shoulder surgery and received his injection in the surgical arm.  Comparing his arm from Monday&#39;s visit to when he presented on Friday there was a significant change around his incision with increased redness, warmth, and firmness of his arm tissue.  Call was placed immediately to patient&#39;s surgeon office and patient was seen later in the day by his surgeon for further follow-up.  Therapy was put on hold for the day.   Patient seen by surgeon 3/19/2021, arm warm to the touch so oral antibiotics started. Unsure if related to covid vaccine. Patient seen again 3/19/2021, still some warmth to mid humerus area and swelling that has been present since surgery. No active infection noted.

A 56-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Mar2021 at 10.30 (at the age of 56-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension diagnosed 20 years ago, blood cholesterol diagnosed about 7 years ago, Covid-19 in Dec2020 which hit him pretty hard, double pneumonia, he was wiped out, patient had a shingles vaccine a couple of years ago he had a fever and it felt like he had the flu, for about 48 hours he was wiped out. This happened with both doses of the shingles vaccine. Concomitant medication(s) included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). On 24Mar2021 (Wednesday), patient experienced double pneumonia, body aches/i started aching, my arm hurt, headache, tired/fatigue/exhausted, i got the chills, my skin felt like it was sunburned, cough, fog, no appetite, sweating, sore arm, he had a previous flu like symptoms after the shingles vaccine. It was reported that all the same symptoms the patient had with COVID, the caller had after the vaccine. The next morning was much worse and through that next day. Patient describes his side effects like a mini Covid 19 reaction. The symptoms were very similar to the symptoms he had 4 days into his Covid-19 diagnosis.

My arms, chest, back, and legs. As the day went on and I moved around, the hives disappeared. Before going to bed, I noticed that my left eye was mildly swollen. The next morning, I woke up and the hives returned. Again, after moving around, the hives went away. Later in the late afternoon and into the evening, I noticed that both of my eyes were swollen and so was my upper lip. I woke up and the hives returned, only one eye was swollen and my lip was swollen. By later in the afternoon, the hives and swelling had just about disappeared. The following morning, I was back to normal with no hives and no swelling around my eyes or lips.

I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

This is the second of two reports. The reporter describes events following both vaccinations in a vaccine series. This report is for those events which occurred following the second vaccination.      A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3249), intramuscularly on 01Feb2021  (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s historical vaccinations included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 after which he experienced inflammation, joint pain and burning sensation in the joints. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The vaccination was administered at a hospital. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), tamulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) all from unspecified dates and for unknown indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Per the reporting physician, he got his first vaccine on 22Dec2020.  His MCP and PIP joints and SI joints started burning close to 3rd week in Jan2021. He had some minor SI pains intermittently before but none with hands. Continued hurting enough that he started taking Osteobiflex and fish oil and more tylenol for inflammation. After second vaccine on 01Feb2021 the symptoms he experienced after the first dose have been getting worse.  He mentioned that his hands burn all the time, at times like tonight bad enough that they keep him awake.  He has red nodular areas on some of his knuckles and a distinct nodule at the proximal ulnar aspect of my left 4th finger PIP that is uniformly erythematous. Not all knuckles have the same degree of burning, but all including thumbs have it. The SI joint pain is more variable and at time does not bother him, but the hands get swollen and tight to close everyday. He plans to start some prednisone tomorrow due to the progression of the burning. The clinical outcomes of the events burning sensation in joints worsened, swelling of hands, stiffness joints, inflammation, condition worsended, erythema, nodule on extremity were reported as not recovered. The outcomes of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administration and off label use were unknown.  It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021154881 Same patient, same drug, different AE, different dose of vaccine.

                                                One week after the vaccine the arm was very red and looked infected. He went to the doctor and was given Amoxicillin. But two days later he was feeling so ill he was in bed all day and had a horrible headache. He went back to the doctor 3-26. The doctor cut his arm open, drained it, flushed it and gave him an antibiotic shot in the rear end. He also prescribed Doxycycline and Linezolid because he believes its a MRSA infection. He did swab it but we don&#39;t have the results back yet. The wound is not as red today and my husband is feeling better. Should he get the second vaccine? the doctor said this was the second patient he saw that day with the same infection at the vaccine site. I received my vaccine the same time and had zero issues. The doctor thought maybe his arm was not sufficiently alcohol swabbed but I know he was swabbed as was I as we were in the same room. He has severe asthma so we wanted the protection from the Covid vaccine but want to know if it is safe to get the second vaccine? I have taken photos each day so I can share what his arm has looked like

A 57-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 57-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included joint pain and ongoing 45-packs per year smoker. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), hydroxyzine (manufacturer unknown) and diclofenac sodium (manufacturer unknown). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The physician reported, &#34;patient had anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema on separate hospitalization (I was not involved for this but reviewed photos and this was reportedly attributed to the vaccine; I&#39;m uncertain if that event was reported). On hospitalization, the patient was with small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism on a CT PE (CT scan for Pulmonary Embolus). Patient is an active smoker. No other obvious cause.&#34; As a result of the adverse events (unspecified), the patient was hospitalized for one day. The start date of the events was on 29Mar2021. The patient was treated with apixaban (for pulmonary embolism). The clinical outcome of &#34;anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema&#34; and &#34;small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism&#34; was resolving.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for events pulmonary embolism, anaphylactic reaction and associated generalized rash and generalized erythema.

He said when his heart rate got bad, it was about 12:30PM today and that today (30Dec2020) at work he didn&#39;t feel right at lunch, so he took his oxygen level and heart rate. He said his heart rate was 141. He said he called his primary care doctor, but didn&#39;t go to the emergency room. He said he doesn&#39;t have chest pain.

He said he spoke to the nurse at his doctor&#39;s office, and the nurse said the doctor couldn&#39;t do much, and that he could go to emergency room or their practice&#39;s urgent care that is open until 7:00PM.  He said he tried to go to the hospital emergency room, but ended up driving by because the hospital was so busy they were triaging patient&#39;s in the parking lot.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, on 22Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID 19 immunization. Relevant medical history included COVID infection last Apr2020. On the peak of the COVID pandemic he had the COVID infection, he lost the sense of taste and smell, had diarrhea although he did not have fever and did not have coughing. He also has medical history of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome. He was tested for COVID, he was positive 2 times and then they did PET scan, MRI from head to toe. They were looking for tumor, neuroblastoma, what was causing the shaking, the myoclonus, the opsoclonus, the ataxia, they could not find anything. They gave him convalescent plasma and then they gave him immunoglobulin human normal (IVIG) 5 doses and they gave him high dose of steroid to the point that his blood sugar was reaching sky high they have to give him insulin. He was hospitalized 2 times, 3rd time was 2 days and sent home and then it got worst, so he was readmitted for another &#39;3&#39; days. So, he was sent home on clonazepam, it makes him drowsy and he went for physical therapy and slowly after almost after 8 weeks his symptoms disappear, and he was able to go back to work. His symptoms all recovered by the end of May, towards the beginning of Jun2020 he went back for the swab test, it was negative, COVID PCR negative and my antibody was positive. Concomitant medications included clonazepam, metformin and simvastatin. Patient went back to work and have no symptoms until this 07Jan2020. Like almost 3 week or two and half weeks after he received the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Two and half weeks later he started having symptoms like shaking of the hands that I could barely write and yesterday he could barely walk down the stairs. The patient received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Dec2020. Immediately after the vaccination the patient felt that his hands became weak. He ignored it because it went away, like after a minute or so it went away. He went home and nothing happened, except for the soreness of the arm the injection site for 2 days, which really did not bother him. Then this past Thursday, 07Jan2021, he went to the church, he was lightning a candle and his hands started to shake, he can barely light a candle. He was able to do it although his hands were shaking. So, he went home. He ate breakfast, and called his neurologist and he said just to observe and then it went away. On Saturday night (09Jan2021) he noticed that his hands were shaking again when he was typing in the keyboard. He can manage to type but his hands were shaking. He went to sleep and just ignored it. Then yesterday, Sunday he worked again, it became worse, his handwriting was shaking. He was really holding on to the pen to write legibly and then he was in the third floor hospital, elevators did not work. So, he walked down through the stairs, both of his legs were shaking very bad while he was walking down three slides of stairs but he thought he came to the ground so he was able to walk on the flat floor on the street and able to walk home. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Outcome of the event tremor was unknown, while for the other events was unknown. The consumer considered a causal relationship between the events and the vaccine.

                                                upper bicep pain/soreness around upper part of bicep; tendonitis; lymphadenopathy; sore deltoid; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Healthcare Professional (patient).  This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it&#39;s still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it&#39;s lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can&#39;t think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn&#39;t want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn&#39;t know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node&#39;s reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020. His second dose is scheduled tomorrow (14Jan2021) and wants to know if he can still take it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events myalgia and lymphadenopathy were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tendonitis with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Injection site pain; Arm pretty sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician who reported for himself. A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot #: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 at 09:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included a history of anaphylaxis to latex which predated treatment with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, heart rate control, hypertension and high cholesterol; all from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s medical history was &#34;none&#34; and that the patient had no illness at the time of vaccination. Family medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications included ongoing metoprolol taken for heart rate control taken from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for two years&#34;), ongoing telmisartan taken for hypertension orally from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for two years&#34;) at 1x/day (take once daily by mouth) and ongoing rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR; strength: 40mg) taken for high cholesterol from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for 10 years&#34;) at 40mg, 1x/day. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Dec2020 the patient experienced &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34;. It was reported that &#34;a physician called regarding the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he received the second dose of the vaccine on Thursday and was advised by his medical director to call Pfizer to report his symptoms. He reported that he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine three weeks prior to the second dose. The patient first stated that was about 14Dec2020, but then clarified that per his vaccine card, he received the first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at 0900AM in the left arm. The patient stated that he noticed injection site pain that lasted about two days and his arm was pretty sore. Both events completely resolved before the second dose.&#34; It was reported that the events did not require a visit to the physician or to the ER. It was reported that there were no relevant tests. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34; were both recovered/resolved on 15Jan2021.  The reporter considered that there was reasonable possibility (method of assessment: Global introspection) that the events &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34; were related to BNT162B2.

                                                No initial symptoms other than sore arm at injection site which lasted for about 23 hours. On January 28 in the middle of the night woke up with pain in left hand. Could not move left hand. Was sleeping on back - not on arm or hand.  No restricted blood-flow.  Massaged hand and it became responsive.  This was followed by burning and tingling sensation in hand.  Hand was cold to touch first day. Burning and tingling and muscle tension increased for first couple days.  Would be intermittent and location varied. Hands and feet most common. Left back scapular area and left pectoral muscle common.  Muscle tightness would cause joint pain without signs of any redness. No temperature. No discoloration. Not as bad in middle of the day. After a few days. When second shot was administered on February 9 at 12:10 AM went home and all sensations stopped for about 12 hours. Took Tylenol with some benefit to diminish but not end symptoms. In past few days have read about taking antihistamines which has often helped.  Symptoms are not as intense as they started out to be, but they continue to linger.  Muscle tightness has largely given way to fluttering sensation or paresthesia and burning is mostly in bottom of left foot only. Any muscle tightness can be rubbed out (massage) for the most part. Occasional joint tightness continues in fingers - crack knuckles and it improves.

Pt returned to work 03/01/2021 then checked into urgent care the following day d/t worsening symptoms. Patient Plan written by PAC: &#34;At this time the nature of your pain is not clear. Your cardiac enzymes are within normal limits except for myoglobin which often goes up with skeletal muscle pain. Your BNP test which can come up with congestive heart failure is elevated slightly from your normal.  We will want to recheck this in a week or so. Differential diagnoses could be skeletal muscle pain/injury, herpes zoster or shingles. (This can sometimes have sharp nerve type pain that will develop into a rash within the first 7 days.) Your rapid COVID test was negative.  We are sending a PCR test out just to confirm.  While awaiting test results please isolate at home. We will call you soon as results are back. Refer to Mendocino County&#39;s packet/isolation order. Your potassium level is low at 3.2.  It should be 3.6. We gave you some potassium to take in the clinic.  I am going to give you some to take for an additional few days. When you follow-up next week plan to have your labs redrawn.&#34; Plan Orders: SARS-CoV-2 RNA (COVID-19), QUALITATIVE NAAT to be performed. URIC ACID to be performed. The patient had the following medication order(s) completed today: Potassium Chloride 40meq PO; Toradol 15mg IVP.

                                                I had a single red blotch on my right ankle appear the day after my first vaccination. I did not complete an adverse reaction form for it because I was not sure it was related. When I got my second dose, I did not experience any reaction other than a sore arm until three days later. I developed red blotches/hives on my arms, legs, and torso (front and back).  I took two Benadryl on Sunday morning and two more that night.  They tended to go away and then others would pop up in other locations of my body. The Benadryl did not seem to have any significant affect. I was very itchy for several days. i went to see my doctor on the 5th day since it occurred over the weekend and I had an epi pen if I needed it. It was getting better when I saw her so I didn&#39;t want anything other than a topical, which didn&#39;t come in to the pharmacy until they cleared up. I stopped itching by Monday and they were pretty well gone by Wednesday, which was 7 days later. I took photos of the spots.

                                                Right Foot started hurting the night after the vaccine. The next day, it hurt to  walk on it. Mainly around the base of my 2nd and 3rd toes. The next day it hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t walk on it and saw the doctor. A red area had developed on top of my foot at the base on my toes. Doctor though could be Gout but didn&#39;t really look like it and usually that is in the big toes. Plus the timing of this issue and my vaccine were suspect. Had X-ray on that Friday, two days after vaccine and everything looked fine they said. I was prescribed Celebrex  and over the weekend took two per day due to the pain. I stayed in bed all weekend and pain got worse before taking another dose of medicine which helped for a while.  Swelling continued to be about the same or a bit more and the redness moved over to my big toe and then up my foot around towards the right side. Today my right side of foot is really soar now as well and still can&#39;t walk on it and still swollen. Doctor at a urgent care sports medicine location prescribed me Prednisone steroid to see if that helps. But so far 5 days after vaccine and my foot is still swollen, red across the top and so painful it keeps me up at night and I can&#39;t walk on it. I&#39;m hoping the steroids work.

                                                At 1300 on March 26 I received the shot in my left arm. I went back to work after receiving the vaccine I returned to work. At 1720 I was at home and started itch all over my, arms legs, and stomach. Broke out in a rash on my stomach and chest. At 1830 my tongue was swelling and had a hard time speaking. I call a friend and told her. She told me to take some Benadryl. I did. I then went to bed. My friend came over at about 2100 because she was worried and found me in bed. My breathing was off and she tried to wake me. She called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.  I am now in rehab with undetermined results as to what happened.

                                                Excruciating pain in ALL o my body.  The vaccine has triggered a Fibromyalgia episode from hell.  Extreme pain in ALL of my body.  It feels like all my nerve endings are on fire.  And when they are not on fire, they itch so bad, and I have scratched them so much, I have sores and scabs on my arms and legs from scratching a itch I can not reach.  Feels like the itching is under my skin.  Not on top.   1) Pain in ALL my body 2) High temperature - my house is 91 degrees and I&#39;m in a blanket and I&#34;m still cold 3) Even though I&#39;m cold - I sweat a lot 4) Have not been able to eat since I got the vaccine 8 days ago - growing very weak and loosing weight 5) I&#39;m dehydrated - Having trouble keeping liquids down 6) Bad stomach pains - sharp pains 7) Real bad gas and lots of it - Not normal for me 8) My kidneys hurt real bad - Probably clogged and overworked      I spend most of my time on the floor n my back.  Hurts too much to stand and walk   NOTE:  I&#39;m growing weak and very dehydrated.                   Something needs to be done soon !

A 58-years-old male patient (boyfriend) received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Mar2021 08:30 (at 58-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization (So he wouldn&#39;t get Covid). The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications.

It was reported that after, the patient received the shot on 26Mar2021. 9 days later on 04Apr2021, he began he got a rash on his skin all over his body. He got rash, hives and itching. He also had irritation in his throat on 08Apr2021. So, he went to the doctor and the emergency room and he is taking medication and he has been taken the medication for approximately 4-5 days now. Medication worked during the day but by the next morning the rash and itching start all over that. Body rash: Caller reported that the body rash started in the patient&#39;s torso and under the patient&#39;s arms.  Caller reported that the rash spread up the patient&#39;s neck. Caller reported that the patient had a red, itchy rash (04Apr2021) and there were some hives involved. Caller reported that the patient went to his doctor on 05Apr2021 in terrible, miserable shape. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s physician prescribed prednisone. Caller reported that the patient took the prednisone later in the day on 05Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient went to work on 06Apr2021 and felt a little bit better but during the night of Tuesday, 06Apr2021, the rash began to spread again and the patient began to get the hives. Caller reported that the patient went to work on 07Apr2021, after taking a dose of prednisone. Caller reported that the patient called her around 8:00 PM on the evening of 07Apr2021 and stated it&#39;s starting all over again and it&#39;s spreading. Caller stated that the patient reported that he had hives on his neck, his shoulders, his body, his private parts, and his butt.  Hands swollen (07Apr2021): Caller reported that the patient&#39;s right hand was swelling and had swollen to at least 1 or 2 sizes bigger than normal. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s left hand was swelling some. Caller reported that the patient had difficulty squeezing both hands into fists due to the swelling. Caller reported that the patient went to the emergency room during the night of 07Apr2021. Caller reported that the emergency room provider prescribed a stronger dose of prednisone and administered prednisone to the patient in the emergency room. Caller reported that the patient did not go to work on 15Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient took a dose of the new, stronger prednisone and the prednisone seemed to settle the rash down a little bit. Caller reported that around 3:00 AM 07Apr2021 into Friday, 08Apr2021, the rash started all over again. Caller reported that the patient already had an appointment scheduled with his physician for 08Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s physician referred him to an allergist and the allergist prescribed Fexofenadine HCl 180 mg and Famotidine 40 mg. Caller reported that so far, the fexofenadine and famotidine seem to be working. It was also reported that patient had Burning sensation in esophagus on 08Apr2021. Caller reported that the concern of her and the patient is that the patient is scheduled to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine this Friday, 16Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist is recommending that he wait another 2 weeks to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are going to go to the appointment on 16Apr2021 and request for the appointment to be rescheduled for 2 weeks later. Caller reported that she is very concerned if the patient should be getting a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine or not. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist informed the patient that the patient could get Covid-19 and die from that, but that the patient won&#39;t die from the allergic reaction he is experiencing. Caller reported that she questions the allergist&#39;s opinion because of the misery that the patient has been in. Caller stated that she just needs some answers. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist had stated that there was one other person that he was aware of that had a reaction 10 days after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that it was odd that the rash had started 10 days in, and reported that the patient ruled out food and ruled out any changes as the patient hadn&#39;t changed soap or laundry detergent recently. Details were not provided for the other patient the allergist reported had a delayed reaction 10 days after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist thinks the Covid-19 vaccine caused the patient&#39;s reaction. Caller reported that she and the patient are scared about whether he should get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and are unsure of what she and the patient should do at this point. Caller stated that she knows that people don&#39;t like to give advice, but that they say if you have immediate adverse reaction you shouldn&#39;t get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that the patient&#39;s reaction wasn&#39;t immediate, and asked if it the rash should still be considered an adverse reaction and the patient should not go get second the second dose, or should the patient go with what his doctor said as it is recommended that you should listen to physician. Body rash: Caller reported that the patient&#39;s rash has dissipated for the most part. Caller reported that the patient still has some redness in parts, but the itching has subsided at least as of this morning, 12Apr2021, when she spoke to the patient around 6:00 AM. Hands swollen: Caller reported that the swelling the the patient&#39;s hands went down in the emergency room on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, night and began to dissipate on Thursday, 08Apr2021, with 50 mg of prednisone. Caller reported that she believes the patient&#39;s hands have returned to normal at this point, reporting that the patient is at work and as a mechanic, the patient has to work with hands. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s primary care physician did take blood work, but the patient&#39;s allergist said that the results of the bloodwork would probably not be relevant based on fact that the patient was on medication at the point that the labs were drawn. Caller reported that she believed the initial prescription for prednisone was 10 mg tablets. Caller reported that the patient had to take 4 tablets the first day, 3 tablets the second day, 2 tablets the third day, and 1 tablet after that. Caller reported that she and the patient are concerned about the patient getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are trying to anticipate what would happen after the patient received the second dose. Caller stated that she would like to know if someone would recommend or say it&#39;s ok for the patient to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and if the patient has a reaction, that it won&#39;t be as life threatening as getting Covid-19. Prednisone did not help rash, hives, or itching (10 mg tablets, dispensed in pharmacy bottle).

                                                For many years, when I was younger, I must have had an over-active immune system, because I had those chronic red itchy rashes that wouldn&#39;t heal, on my knees, and elbows - the only places I got them.  For years, though - many years - I have not had this.  After my first injection of the Covid-19 shot I got a few patches - on my right side (knee and elbow) - the shot was on the left side.   I am reporting this because I read that in a few countries only give ONE of these shots to people that have already had Covid-19 (I had the virus almost a year ago) - and was wondering if taking the 2nd shot (since this first one overstimulated my immune system a bit) was a good idea.  Please email me about this concern.

It has increased subsequent to my second dose on 3/4/2021. I had no other significant symptoms after my first dose, but did have sufficient pain at the injection site in my left upper arm the day following my shot to wake me up at night. That went away within 48 hours, but the tinnitus effects have not decreased to date.

I was advised then to take Benadryl to relieve the itching.  I was told to take benadryl the night before and the morning of my 2nd shot which I did. 2nd dose was given on 3/12. On Monday 3/15, I again got the say rash , this time on chest and next. Took Benedryl and Dr. Prescribed Prednisone for 5 days

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 06Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pain, high cholesterol, and testosterone low, joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, any place in his body had pain, and doesn&#39;t have good memory, all ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrocodone for pain, ongoing atorvastatin for high cholesterol, ongoing clomiphene citrate for testosterone medication because it was low because of his age, ongoing colecalciferol (Vitamin D), ongoing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), ongoing oxycodone for pain, and unspecified eye medication. He had many different medications that he was taking. Historical vaccines included chicken pox vaccine for immunization and shingles vaccine in Jan2020 for immunization and experienced pain all over. The patient stated that he was a torture survivor and he has been taking pain medication because of him being tortured previously. He was taking medications for the pain, clarified to be hydrocodone and oxycodone. These medications kept his body stable. He was able to sleep and relax. One day after he received his Pfizer COVID vaccine (07Mar2021), he started feeling the pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse but the pain used to be stable with the way he was using his medicines. But now his body was not stable. Any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously because of the damage of torture but now it all came up after the COVID vaccine. Every piece of his body hurt even if he takes his medications. He still had the pain and his body was so weak for about 4 to 5 hours. He used to be able to do his business all day but now after about 3 to 4 hours on his feet he got so tired and he needed to sit. He didn&#39;t know why this happened. He has talked to others that have received COVID vaccines and none have had this kind of reaction like him. He has asked them about it. It was very frustrating to him on an unspecified date. Every month he sees a physician. He would like for Pfizer to contact him with further questions, he can&#39;t understand the pain. This was really killing him especially when the pain goes to his bones. He will keep him up until 3 in the morning and he stays awake on an unspecified date. He then took medicine and he had to wait for 30 minutes for it to start working and then he will be able to sleep. But other than that, the pain jumped. He has had the chicken pox and the shingles vaccines and none did like that. The pain was not going away in his muscles or joints. And now he was getting a headache on an unspecified date, it was really frustrating. He didn&#39;t have good memory from the torture. This morning, when he woke up, he had the pain in his joints and his bones. He didn&#39;t like to use too much medication. He liked to use it only as he needs it. Pain medications are strong. But this COVID vaccine somehow made him need to use more medication and then that caused him to have a headache. His pain should get better with his medications but today, he had pain all over him and he didn&#39;t have any energy to move. He didn&#39;t know how to explain it. The COVID vaccine had really kind of made him weak. Sometimes he drinks a lot of cranberry juice to try and take the vaccine out of his system and it was frustrating because he hasn&#39;t ever been like this. When he had pain like this it reminded him of his torturing and what had happened to him. When the pain came on strong was when it reminded him of that. The medications he was taking were supposed to kill the pain. That was the reason he got so pissed and was trying to ask what was going on. This COVID vaccine is not safe he believed because it has been almost 10 days and it was not helping him. He was still not good. After he got his COVID vaccine on 06Mar2021, he had a little bit of small itching, not much, just a little bit that made him feel not comfortable with it. That was why they kept him for 20 minutes after his vaccine. When he got back home, he was okay, it was nothing serious. But then the day after his COVID vaccine on 07Mar2021, his joints, his muscles and his bones had pain. On 06Mar2021 the itching lasted about 20 minutes. He felt like he was chewing his lip, he was a little uncomfortable and he felt his ribs moving quicker. Nothing happened but he could feel it. He tried to chew his lips a couple of times, but not that much. But after that, he had pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine, 07Mar2021. By the time this vaccine started getting into his body, it was really hurting and getting worse. He had the shingles vaccine and for 1 1/2 to 2 days, he had pain all over and then 2 days after it was all gone, he was back to normal life. The pain was gone. With this COVID vaccine he thought that maybe it was going to be the same but it was not the same and it was hurting. The shingles vaccine was last year in 2020, 3 months before people knew about the coronavirus that was when he got the vaccine for shingles, so maybe Jan2020 was when he had the shingles vaccine. He had no medical conditions or heart and chest problems. No other vaccine he has taken has ever had this type of side effect to him. He took his shingles vaccine in his right arm and the COVID vaccine was in his left. With both he had the same start of having the bad pain. This COVID vaccine goes deeply to the body. The vaccines job is to wake the body. The vaccine&#39;s job is to wake up the body for the virus. The body has to make some kind of soldiers to stand up on the virus and this COVID vaccine had actually made his body weak. After the vaccine is supposed to wake the body, little by little the side effects are supposed to go away. His body was not learning this vaccine. It kept fighting to learn whatever was in this COVID vaccine, his body can&#39;t learn it and fight it. That was the reason his body got weak and the pain has not gone away. His body is still in alert and that&#39;s why the pain was still there. His body was still fighting. Somehow it didn&#39;t match the inside of the body. Maybe for some people that this will happen to, they will be okay but for some they will not be okay. It is not because some people have nothing wrong with them. The patient recovered from itching and discomfort on 06Mar2021; not recovered from any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously/ pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse/ pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine; while outcome of other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 59-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EN6207, Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (at the age of 59 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lupus from 2020 and ongoing, ongoing High Blood Pressure, Spinal Surgeries from 1999, Chronic Pain,Retention water, blood clot issue. The patient previously had tetanus shot. Concomitant medications included losartan potassium; allopurinol; hydroxychloroquine; methocarbamol; morphine sulfate (MS CONTIN); oxycodone; furosemide.  Caller states he is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. Seven days later the dose of vaccine (18Mar2021), patient developed Bell&#39;s Palsy which he has never had before and has never had any other problem with. He has seen an ENT, his pain doctor, and his medical doctor and they all say the Covid vaccine has caused the problem he is having. He was told by his ENT this is very possibly permanent. Emergency Doctors are who he went to because he thought he was having a stroke, because half of his face went numb. He has been to the doctor 10 times in the last 7 days, it has not been fun at all. He didn&#39;t put it together until he saw the ENT, who said Bell&#39;s Palsy is caused from a virus. States he had no idea until he said that, that it could possibly be from the injection. States he has never had Bells Palsy before and it started 8 days after the initial shot. His right eyelid was sticking on his eye and wouldn&#39;t shut and he couldn&#39;t move his face on the left side and he can&#39;t control it at all. Clarifies he couldn&#39;t shut his right eye all of the way. Since then they have told him he needs to tape his eye shut for 12 hours a day to keep from going blind. The thing that bothers him is his eye sight in that eye is getting worse every day even though he uses the cream and tapes it shut. His wife told him even with both eyes shut, it will not completely shut because his lower eyelid is hanging down too far. The ENT told him he needs a hearing test today at 2:00p.m. to see if this is going to be a permanent problem. He is getting ready to go to the ear doctor to find out more. At the same time he developed the Bells Palsy, his blood got really thin and wouldn&#39;t clot which seems really weird. Also on 18MAR2021, his left hand got really swollen and the entire arm bruised and they said the edema in his hand got to the point where his skin was cracking because his blood got so thin that it couldn&#39;t clot at all. He had a blood clot issue in the past. States his arm and hand have improved, he can move his hand again finally. The ENT said that since he has been on Prednisone, for recovery for Bells Palsy, for over a week and gotten worse instead of better, it may be permanent. Prednisone is not working, it has actually gotten worse. Prednisone 10mg for 7 days and to decrease by one tablet every day until gone but states he has gotten worse. Treatments (assessed as for all events): Prednisone. States that it has been two weeks since this happened and the doctor told him the only other option is skull surgery. The bones in his head would be drilled out to make room for the nerves in hopes he would be able to work his mouth again, so not a good thing. Eye cream. He is on disability and his house payment is 3/4 of what he makes, so he can&#39;t take care of the medical bills himself otherwise he wouldn&#39;t worry about it. It is very depressing. His medical doctor said he hadn&#39;t seen any cases of Bell&#39;s Palsy for 2 years, and he has seen 4 in the last week so that doesn&#39;t give him a lot of confidence even though he is still encouraging people to get the vaccine because it is safer than not.He has multiple visits to the ER 3 times between 18MAR2021 and 19MAR2021 within 24 hours; states he was in the ER for hours and hours but no admission. States they did a CT Scan, MRI, CT with contrast and then after that ended up 22 saw ENT who confirmed the fact that Covid Vaccine that gave Bells Palsy and on 22-23 saw his GM again. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None within 4 weeks; states 9 months ago he had a Tetanus Shot. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy, Visual acuity decreased, Eyelid disorder, Orofacial dyskinesia, numbness in face was not recovered; other events was recovering. All events happened on 18Mar2021.

                                                Patient called reporting intense skin pain between shoulder blades on back. He described it as pain similar to a severe sunburn but no skin rash bumps or skin discoloration present. was vaccinated in left arm and wondered if it was administration error. I told him it could potentially be but I have never had anyone report such adverse event. I told him I would report it and recommended he follow up with a prescribing doctor since his pain was so severe. VAERS report completed 05/05/21 on same patient  but patient called back 05/06/21 for update so new VAERS submitted.   update:   reported he had a shingles type reaction over his back and whole torso. Patient&#39;s doctor has been made aware and has prescribed him pain and shingles meds to help with it. The consulting pharmacist will be made aware to update the VAERS
