Positively reactive to increased information and seeing improvement in blotchiness. Left at 14:08.

The following day I had mild muscle soreness and injection site pain without swelling or redness.

A 40-year-old male patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 21Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), COVID-19 in 2020 (Jun2020 or Jul2020; tested positive for COVID-19 at that time and has 3 tests after that which were all negative) and since then lost weight (2020), and root canal. The patient had no issues with vaccines in the past. There were issues with the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, because he would be positive to TB, but this is because of his culture, he is from a specific country, and so they cannot take that vaccine. The patient clarified that he did not take the TB vaccine, what he meant was he is aware he can&#39;t take it. On 21Dec2020, the patient works in healthcare and had a patient that came in that tested positive for COVID-19 and so because of that, everyone including him that came in contact with the COVID-19 positive patient had to check and get tested. This happened the same day as his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the test (Dec2020) came out negative. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had not had any antibody test for COVID-19. The patient asked the doctor, but she never scheduled him for that, until after last month, she talked to him about it, but by that time he told her that he doesn&#39;t need it now - it&#39;s been almost a year. The patient had the first dose on 21Dec2020 and at that time he did experience symptoms the next day (22Dec2020). At that time after the first dose administration (21Dec2020), he could not lift his arm and it was bruised under the arm. The next day (22Dec2020), he had back pain, with his neck he could not turn it (neck pain), he could not be on his left side where he got the shot on left arm, it was like that for 3 days. Then on Thursday (24Dec2020), he had headache every time he bended his head down, he would be sleeping and would wake up in middle of night because of the headache, it felt like a sinus headache on one side of the head, and when he bend his head down, he would feel it, it stayed this way till 29Dec2020 (Tuesday). The patient has a question trying to find out with his employer. They told them they need to take the vaccine, they pushed them to take the vaccine, he works in healthcare. If they get sick at the job, he asked if they (employer) would pay for it, how would he get paid. The job told him he gets paid sick days and asked how they would do that. The patient asked how long the vaccine was alive in the body and how does it work. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I have a reaction to the flu shot so my MD recommended that I premedicate with Zyrtec. I did one hour prior to injection. Around 5 minutes after my injection I could feel my throat swelling. I alerted the nurse and took a Benadryl tablet. The swelling stayed consistent and I was able to breathe so I waited for an hour and then went home. When I arrived home I felt and increase in the swelling so I took another Benadryl. The swelling slightly decreased but was still present for 5 hours post shot and then disappeared.  The only other reaction I had was metallic taste in my mouth and extremely sore arm where injection was given for 2 days.

                                                40 y.o. male with PMHx including asthma and HLD presenting to the ED today with c/f allergic reaction. Pt is coming in after about 35 minutes ago he had some extreme flushing he describes it as &#34;feeling like he put his head in an oven and some skin itchiness on his arms. He notes he started taking niacin today. He also got his second dose of his Covid vaccine last night. He has no throat swelling or difficult breathing. He has not had any nausea or vomiting. He denies any recent fevers or chills. He did switch his asthma medications to Trelegy last week. He otherwise has no other allergies. The patient had just started taking Niacin which is more likely the etiology of the case in question and symptoms rather than the vaccine-pfizer. Most likely this was related to the niacin and not the pfizer vaccine.

By 10hrs, I started with varying chills/sweats that lasted all night, injection site soreness, and soreness in left breast area. The next day I was extremely exhausted and had trouble staying awake. Muscle aches in both shoulders and neck. Also had varying fever from 100 up to 104.1 throughout the day. At 36hrs after injection. I took 2 Advil to help with the muscle aches...nothing taken to this point. 48hrs After injection some energy returned, but still lethargic throughout the day, and occasion fever between 100-101. During shower, I noticed swelling under my left armpit, not present on the right side. At 60hrs after injection, fever gone, energy returned...lingering soreness of left shoulder and breast area and swelling under left armpit remains.  At no point did I have any breathing or lung issues...but otherwise it felt like I had a bad flu (minus the coughing/wheezing) for 2 days.

                                                I have a history of neuropathy that has been dormant most of the last year. I went in with no nueropathy occuring to get my vaccines. After the 1st Pfizer shot I had neuropathy starting the day after that went away in about  a week. After the 2nd about 3 days later it started with itching all over my body (neuropathic itch), and burning mostly in my feet, but random electrical shocks throughout my body 24/7 (while awake). It has not subsided and has actually gotten worse. There are at least a dozen people on the clinic message board saying the same thing happened to them, that the vaccine awakened or made worse their neuropathy exponentially. Here is the link to similar complaints.

The first day, following the shot, I had a bit of soreness at the injection site but it was gone by the following day, Friday, 3/26/21. I had a general feeling of weakness the afternoon and into the night on the day of the shot as well. However, it was about midday or a bit after the following day that I began feeling obvious side effects. These include, primarily, a general feeling of being ill. Headache (but that&#39;s not that abnormal &amp; body aches and stiffness similar to a mild version of influenza. It appeared late in the day on Saturday, 3/27/21 and has continued since.

A 40-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscularly, administered in arm left on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 40-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension and COVID-19 prior to vaccination; patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included lisinopril. Patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and the COVID vaccine was received at a Public Health Clinic/Veterans Administration facility. On 15Mar2021, the patient experienced thrombocytopenia (109,000), elevated D dimer (3960), fatigue, subjective fever, headache, sweats, injection site pain and paresthesias of hand on side of injection. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was tested for COVID post-vaccination through a nasal swab and Biofire PCR on 22Mar2021 which were both negative. Therapeutic measure taken as a result of the events included IV hydration. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and close temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product bnt162b2 and all reported events.

Almost like blisters, any itching causes them to break open and bleed.  The seem to be subsiding finally (after 2 weeks) but some new small ones still seem to be popping up.  I can&#39;t seem to match up with anything else by viewing photos online, looks most similar to scavies, but nothing else fits (hasn&#39;t spread to family members, location on my body etc...)  I was working in a wooded area the weekend prior to vaccination but the bumps don&#39;t match anything I can find for plant based rash. Tried to seek medical help, but appointments are all booked and cannot get an expedient visit.  I haven&#39;t considered it concerning enough for an ER visit.

Discussed with another healthcare provider Discussed case with another healthcare provider ? Consultation Consultation 1, Consultation 2 ? Consultation 1 04/16/2021 15:54 ? Consultation 1 Comments discussed with  RPh.  He will come to ER to obtain additional information from patient.  This is the hospital&#39;s first presumptive Pfizer vaccine reaction. ? Consultation 2 04/16/2021 15:41 ? Consultation 2 Comments discussed with Dr.  we discuss presentation.  he agrees pt will need monitoring with the persisting symptom/findings and the H/O COPD.  1617 Dr has been to ER and completed eval.  pt to be placed on 2nd floor med/tele for additional monitoring and treatment.  pt did have labs yesterday.    ? Decision to Admit Based On  1446 Based on his symptoms and presentation presumptive acute anaphylaxis to component of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  We will begin treatment with 0.3 mg epinephrine IM once as well as dexamethasone, famotidine, diphenhydramine IV. We will continue to monitor with cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  He does have slight wheezing but this may be related to his chronic COPD.  No respiratory distress at this time, but his symptoms seem to have been mildly progressive over the past hour (per his report).  I believe inclusion of the epi to be prudent based on his presentation. Additionally, I will inform the vaccination clinic of this reaction.  he agrees pt will benefit from continued monitoring and repeated IV antihistamine and IV steroid treatment.  Pt will need IVFluid for hydration as well.   Recheck: ? Recheck Recheck 1, Recheck 2, Recheck 3 ? Time 14:55 ? Recheck patient stable  patient improving with treatment ? Comments He is improving.  His skin is now warm and moist (not sweatty , not diaphoretic).  The rash is receeding from the arms. Good coloration to the legs/ankles.  Back &amp; torso rash starting to recede.  no nausea/vomiting. no difficulty breathing. still with fading macular rash on the torso and upper back.

Patient rash has faded from his extremities fully and appears to have faded from his abdomen still somewhat at the malar area of the cheeks as well as the neck and torso portion of the chest.  His pulse is 98?99 continues to have elevated blood pressure.  Pulse oximetry 98-100% on room air, normal.  Pharmacist will enter the reaction into the CDC/FDA/Pfizer database. Overall pt notes he feels tired (probably related to hydration &amp; benadryl).  He notes he has returned to home about 2 weeks ago after spending some time on the road in mountains playing guitar / touring with a small band , playing music. ? Time #3 15:37 ? Recheck #3 patient stable ? Comments #3 He has been resting.  No respiratory distress.  His blood pressure and pulse and pulse oximetry are reviewed at bedside and they are nonfocal at this time.  Overall he is improving.  He notes he still has malaise and feels about the same with itching in his back and the sensation in his throat.  When I evaluate his back there is hyperemia/some macular rash that is in approximately the distribution of the trapezius muscle of the back this is where he notes he has the itching.  Additionally when I evaluate his throat there is still some presence of uvula edema.  There is no other angioedema.  Perhaps he does have some mild hyperemia to the uvula and soft palate at this time.  He is clinically improving but his symptoms have not resolved fully.  Skin warm and dry normal turgor.

                                                My lips became extremely red and swollen a couple of hours after the shot.  I think there was some other minor face swelling around the nose, but the lips were the main issue.  I took Benadryl for a few days and the lips were back to normal in about a week.

Within 15-30 minutes my neck could barely move without pain. My head also noticeable was leaning to my right side. My upper back, should blade area became tight and I couldn&#39;t really use my arms without having pain in the area. I went home and laid down on a heating pad. I couldn&#39;t even flinch without pain in the area. As the afternoon went on, it got a little better. I took Ibuprofen which helped a little. The next day it was slightly better. Today is 4/29, almost a week later and it&#39;s still not 100%. My neck is stiff. The right side where my shoulder blade ends is in a lot of pain. I can&#39;t really lift anything.

                                                The day after had myalgias and fatigue and arm pain.  But on 1/10/21 began developing mild 2/10 headaches.  On 1/11/21 the headache  worsened to 4/10 and was associated with myalgias and neck stiffness.  After a jog, I was in the shower and noticed a rash all over my body that had been pruritic.  I went to the ER that night where I tested negative for flu A/B and also tested negative for covid (Antigen then PCR).  Got a CMP, CBC, and coags to rule out ITP.  everything was normal.  The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

Removing for changing the blanket to a thinner one resulted in extreme chills within one minute. Covering with blanket resulted in extreme hot within 10 minutes. Repeated this cycle for several hours until fall asleep.  High discomfort throughout body. Woke up at 10:00 a.m. with mild grade fever of 99.5° (average resting temperature is 96.5).  Felt extreme cold and chills shivering body aches headache until 6:00 p.m.  felt hungry and okay enough to eat.  Main concern is the extreme hot to extreme cold cycle in early morning. It felt as though the body was not in sync. During fever throughout day/afternoon body&#39;s reaction was normal - fever meant chills and shivering, putting on a blanket meant comfortable warmth (after long periods of time).   But in early morning no no fever yet body burning hot almost suffocating sauna heat insider body, and removing the blanket a immediate and severe chills with uncontrollable shaking, instead of relief from heat... Concerned if vaccine affects body&#39;s heart regulation system (hypothalamus, thyroid, etc).  General malaise during this period is an understatement... It was not a single spot or feeling pain it was the whole body wanting to twist itself and feeling &#39;deprssed&#39; and very &#39;ill&#39; all over all at once.

                                                shingles on face and near eye; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 41-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2, lot no. EL3249, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 27Jan2021 05:00 PM at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included HTN (hypertension). No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included losartan, colecalciferol (VIT D3), cyanocobalamin (B 12), ubidecarenone (COQ 10), and fish oil. Historical vaccine included first dose BNT162B2 for Covid-19 immunization on 06Jan2021 05:00 PM (left arm, lot no. EK9231). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient experienced shingles on face and near eye on 30Jan2021 that required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was treated with Valtrex. The event was reported as non-serious (did not result to death, not life threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, and not congenital anomaly/birth defect). Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

Patches on my arms, legs, chest, back, and scalp where it was itchy and the skin became instantly red after I scratched it. I took an anti-histamine once a day (Zyrtec) but it didn&#39;t have any real affect. The irritation seems to have mostly gone away on its own. This has never happened to me before. I visited my doctor and she recommended that I document this reaction.

                                                Severe pain in the left eustacean tube from the ear to the throat, including jaw. Feels like intense pressure/blockage, but still able to voluntarily open the tube (pop your ears) and no increase in mucus discharge or congestion. No swollen lymph nodes in the neck.  Pain got up to a level 6/10. Took Extra Strength Tylenol and went to bed early. Following day it still aches some, about the same as the arm area of the shot. Not sharp pain any longer but sore.

                                                A small rash approximately 2 cm in diameter appeared on my right anterior thigh about 4 inches above the knee.  It started off red and mildly itchy with significant warmth compared to the surrounding area.  A day or two later a similar rash appeared on my left wrist and posterior forearm that presented as raised bumps but was similarly itchy.  Another day later a similar rash appeared on my right posterior forearm.  I then decided to contact a telehealth provider who reviewed via video and decided to prescribe over-the-counter anti-histamine (zyrtec) and a topical ointment of mupirocin.  I continued to take the zyrtec and applied the ointment but over the last several days the rash on my leg has increased in size to 20cm x 15 cm with noticeable swelling, itchiness and mild aching pain.  Another noteworthy symptom is the area of the original rash on my thigh deepened in color and is now scaly and less itchy.

                                                Headache - 4 days and still comes and goes sometimes being very extreme. Fatigue - Started feeling tired around 5:00pm the day of the vaccine and I have continued to feel tired after 4 days. Muscle/Joint pain - Started getting sore arm first a couple hours after shot then progressively getting worse on my entire body for 3 days.  On day two is was almost unbearable with my lower back being the most painful.  I could not sleep because of the pain with no position that would relief it. Chills - Started getting chills on the evening of the vaccine.  They came and went for 3 days. On the second day it was uncontrollable shakes no matter how many blankets I used. Fever - Started the night of my vaccine increasing to 102.4 and reaching the highest on the second day at 103.5.  I took ibuprofen every 6 hours for two days straight with it staying steady at above 100. Nausea - Started the evening of the vaccine and got very severe.  It has continued for 4 days. Fast Heartbeat - It has stayed consistently above 110  and sometime getting up to 130 while laying in bed shivering.

When I arrived at home an hour and a half later I was dizzy again and experienced rapid heart beats. Symptoms lasted for 30 minutes and then the symptoms stopped. While I didn?t experience any more side effects today, I did notice that the are around the injection site is significantly swollen and sore. I?m using an ice pack to help bring the swelling down.

                                                Shingles.  The day after the second dose of my Pfizer vaccine I felt numbness and tingling on the left side of my body.  Specifically on the left side of my left arm and down through the left pinky finger.  I also had the same sensation/numbness down the left side of my left leg and into my left pinky toe.  The sensation is intermittent and typically on the left side (the same side of the body as the injection).  Two weeks later I began to feel more tingling on the left side including up through my left jaw and on the left side of the top of my head.  The following day I realized I had two blisters under my left arm pit which made it clear I had shingles.  Today is 3 weeks since my second shot and I still continue to feel numbness and tingling.

A 41-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 22Dec2020 at 16:15 as a single dose in the hospital for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension and hyperlipidemia both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no known allergies. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks prior to the vaccine and received other medications in two weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. On 22Dec2021, shortly after the first dose vaccine, the patient started to get eczema and started to itch all over his body. On an unknown date in Dec2020, about 4-5 days after the vaccine, he noticed a large bruise on his abdomen. The bruise went away, however a lump developed on 28Dec2020. He saw his primary care physician (PCP) and he did an ultrasound on an unknown date in Dec2020 that was inconclusive. It wasn&#39;t until he went to the dermatologist about the itching and eczema and mentioned the lump on his abdomen that they did a biopsy on 28Dec2020 and diagnosed the patient with with Morphea. The patient received steriods and UVA 1 treatments for the events. The events were reported to have resulted to a disability or permanent damage. The outcome of the event large bruise on his abdomen was recovered on Dec2020 with the outcome of the other events was not recovered. The patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL0140) on 15Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the event Morphea and the symptoms reported with it together with the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. The case will be assessed further upon receipt of additional information.

                                                I felt completely fine for the first 5 minutes.  I left the store.  After 5 more minutes I started feeling bad (I was seated).  My whole body was sweating and my vision was affected (everything was bright).  I was able to return to the store but was close to passing out.  I sat down for about 10-15 minutes while the symptoms persisted and I was not able to see well.  After that time the sweating stopped and my sight was no longer affected.  This was not anxiety and I have no history of fainting with shots.  This was a reaction to the shot.  After about an hour I felt fine except for muscle soreness at the injection sight.  If the reaction was any worse I would have passed out or asked for help.  I am hesitant to get a second dose out of concern that the reaction could be worse.

                                                I woke up at approximately 2 am 137 hours after the first injection with hives on my arms, legs, backs and chest and stomach. told me to use a steroid cream and antihistamines, zyrtec, or benadryl. None of it worked, but after about a week the itching went away on it&#39;s own. I received the second dose at about 9:30 am, on March 27th, 2021, and by 11:30 am my entire body was itching from head to toe. Multiple times since I have had outbreaks of itching, without an apparent presentation of hives. Specifically when the temperature was higher and I was active outdoors in direct sunlight, though the itching occurs in every location on my body, eyes, ears lobes and canals, nose, face, arms, legs, hands, feet, chest, back, butt, scrotum, and pretty much everywhere else. Continued treatment included prednisone and Banophen after other things failed to Work. Prednisone caused the pain to intensify. Banophen failed to ease the itching.

                                                I received the first vaccine without a single side effect. However, the evening after receiving my second dose, I began to get chills, a fever of 101.7, and night sweats. The next morning I woke up to two rashes on my chest. I continued to experience chills, a fever of 102, and the rash now covers my entire body, including my face. The rash is painful, itchy, and bumpy. This is day two. I have swollen lymph nodes in my neck. The urgent care I saw today told me to watch my throat to make sure it doesn&#39;t close up.

A 42-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 (at the age of 42-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications were reported as none. On an unspecified date (&#34;roughly&#34; 6 hours after the vaccine was administered) the patient experienced &#34;muscle ache&#34;, &#34;chills&#34;, &#34;headache is so severe most disturbing one; it was getting too bad, my head want to fall off, I could not work&#34; and &#34;left arm is too sore way it was administered&#34;. The patient reported that he called &#34;because he took the COVID-19 vaccine last night and he had been having reactions from last time till this time&#34; (as reported). The patient stated that there was no doctor that prescribed the medication, it was administered to him because he was a healthcare worker (certified nursing assistant). He stated that he had been having &#34;muscle ache, chills and severe headache, the headache is so severe, the most disturbing one.&#34; He reported that one of the Tylenol doses was administered to him by the nurse that administered the vaccine. He reported that he took some Tylenol and ibuprofen but this time it was not helping. He stated that he received the vaccine about 24 hours ago and started to experience muscle ache, chills and severe headache roughly about 6 hours after the administration. He reported that &#34;I could hang in, but it was getting too bad, my head wanted to fall off, so I am driving home now so I could not work.&#34; When the patient was asked about the vaccine dose and route he stated &#34;I believe normal dose I believe, I cannot remember I cannot recap anything, but I know it was administered in my left arm, my left arm is too sore the way it was administered.&#34; He stated that he received the vaccination for prevention and to be on the safe side. The patient stated that he did lab work with his doctor a few months ago, probably around 6 or 7 months ago. The clinical outcome of the events &#34;muscle ache&#34;, &#34;chills&#34;, &#34;headache is so severe most disturbing one; it was getting too bad, my head want to fall off, I could not work&#34; were all not recovered/not resolved, while the clinical outcome of the event &#34;left arm is too sore way it was administered&#34; was unknown.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Hypothermia.  Couldn&#39;t get warm.  It&#39;s like my body forgot  how to regulate temperature. I&#39;ve only ever experienced similar coming out of anesthesia after surgery.  Took wearing multiple layers of clothes AND multiple blankets just to stabilize my body temp.  It lasted for around 2-3 hours.  This wasn&#39;t normal &#34;chills&#34;.  This was whole-body shaking hypothermia.  Entire body sore afterwards from the involuntary shaking.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get an actual reading as anything to measure body temp was downstairs and I didn&#39;t want to risk falling.

However, after receiving his second dose of the vaccine on 1/15/2021 in his left deltoid, he noted a rash on his bilateral antecubital fossae on the morning of 1/21/2021. He reported that the rash was erythematous in nature, raised, and pruritic describing the presence of small papules over an erythematous patch of skin that was approximately 1 inch in diameter on both sides. He noted the rash on both antecubital fossae at the same time on the morning of 1/21/2021. Since onset, he has been using topical hydrocortisone cream for symptomatic management. Although these lesions have improved, they have not yet completely resolved. He denied any other symptoms associated with the rash and also denied any other exposures or changes in skin products that might have precipitated this rash.

                                                I have a history of auto immune anemia and ITP.  I checked with my hematologist when scheduled if I should take the shot.  They stated to take it as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/11, I spoke with doctors onsite and discussed my medical history.  They advised to take the shot as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/14, I noticed bleeding in gums and petechiae at the injection site.  I went to hematologist on 02/15, and platelets were at 2,000.  I started 60 mg of prednisone immediately on 02/15.  By 02/19, took blood sample and eceived one 70g dose of IVIG.  Blood results came back on 02/20, and platelets were at 22,000 but did not cover results from after IVIG treatment.  Hematologist decided to stop follow up IVIG treatment and stick to 60mg of prednisone daily as in the past my body has reacted well to it.  On 02/24, platelet count went to 300,000.  I&#39;ve started to taper prednisone to 50mg and will continue with weekly blood tests to verify that platelets remain strong.  Hemoglobin and all over blood levels in the CBC remained normal during this time.  Hematologist has advised not to take second Pfizer COVID-19 shot due to risk.

                                                On Monday I had the COVID vaccination. I noticed no side effects on Tuesday other than tenderness at the injection site. On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccine this past Thursday, 28Jan2021. The next morning (29Jan2021), he woke up with real soreness at the point of administration of his left arm, well beyond what he remembered for a flu vaccine. The second night (30Jan2021), the soreness progressed. It was hard to sleep on his left arm. It was like he had been punched. He had to sleep on his right side versus his left side.

He was typically a high energy person and its very out of the ordinary for him to feel this way. He normally has class on Saturday from 9-noon but he had to cancel going with the amount of fatigue he was experiencing. He also had some cognitive fuzziness on Jan2021. His fatigue was still there, but it has gotten a little better. He was normally very high energy, but he missed two classes and skipped his internship today. He doesn&#39;t feel like himself. He also has had frequent urination which he noticed probably Friday night (29Jan2021), all the way up until now. However, he has been drinking a lot of water.

I went to urgent care and the symptoms began to diminish, but the doctor prescribed prednisone and antihistamine.

                                                shingles; rash; shoulder pain; little nerve pain thing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 42-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: from vaccine card: EL then either 0 or O 142), via an unspecified route of administration by injection once to left arm on 13Jan2021 at single dose for prevention (covid-19 immunisation).  Medical history was none.  There were no concomitant medications. Patient was diagnosed with shingles about 3 weeks after receiving his first injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. This male consumer received his first injection of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021. He reported being diagnosed with shingles last Thursday (04Feb2021) and stated his symptoms started that same week (Feb2021), which were described as rash and shoulder pain. He reported his shingles are improved and are scabbing over. The consumer was prescribed and was taking valacyclovir for treatment of the shingles. Shingles was now (base on 09Feb2021) healing. Shingles occurred after the first dose, he was not blaming the vaccine, he did fine, he had no reaction, his first dose was on 13Jan2021, and shingles came up last week (on 04Feb2021). The consumer&#39;s second dose of the covid-19 vaccine was supposed to be last week (base on 09Feb2021) but this physician recommended he delay due to the shingles. Currently on an antiviral, getting better, feels great, wondering if he can proceed with second dosage. The consumer was wanting to get his second dose this week (base on 09Feb2021). No investigation Assessment. Outcome: he scabbed up, he never had fever, just a rash and the little nerve pain thing (Feb2021), that&#39;s it. Stated he had no reaction to the vaccine whatsoever. The outcome of shingles was recovering, of other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;two weeks after my COVID-19 vaccination I noticed swelling, red spots, and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it. I visited my podiatrist who recommended NSAIDs for a week. Today, my sister in law who is a nurse said it looked like COVID toes. When I googled an image of COVID toes, the spots looked identical to my own.&#34; The adverse events required a physician office visit. The patient received treatment for the events which included NSAIDs. The clinical outcomes of the events swelling, red spots and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it were all not recovered/not resolved. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                The injection was given very high in the left arm.  All the way at the top just below should bone. Higher than the recommended injection sites.  Subsequently the muscle in my arm at injection feels as if the muscle has been torn.  For the first several days I could not move my arm without excruciating muscular pain.  By the end of the first week it seemed to be getting better. However, in the following two weeks, the arm has gotten progressively worse. It?s not as painful as the first few days, but I have limited mobility in my left arm.   I have since received the second injection in  my right arm in the appropriate spot. As of the 24 hours following, I have mild soreness.   I am worried that me left arm deltoid muscle has been torn. I have yet to see a specialist or get an mri.

Then my knees and then foot and hands by the night.  It was burning and itching and it swelled up a little. Oddly the itchiness and redness goes away and then comes.  Taking Allegra does help but its not making the symptoms go away.

Patient was also observed to have reddened spots on his back--but patient was unsure if those were there prior to vaccine.

                                                I had a strange feeling in the left side of my face that I wasn&#39;t sure if it was a reaction or not.  It happened within the first 15 minutes but did not last more than 30 minutes.  I did not experience anything else until the first evening when my arm was very sore.  The next day my arm was more sore and I had a mild circular red mark around the injection site and the arm was much harder on that side.  I also felt a little in my back and neck.  By the second day in the evening the only thing I felt was pain in the arm which eventually traveled into my armpit by day 3.  It wasn&#39;t until day 5 that all the pain was completely gone.  I may have experienced fatigue the first two days also.

                                                Experienced pain in lower back, lower spine area one day after shot #1.  That went away after about a week. After second dose (3 weeks after 1st one), I had no side effects until a few days after when I got the same lower back / spine aching and pain.  About a week and a half after second dose, the lower back pain moved to my left hip area and red spots appeared shortly after (a day or two after the hip pain).  The spots on my left hip and butt area started to burn and feel irritated...  I had mild aching in my pelvis area and lower back (spine) a few days after the shot and still today.  I went to the doctor 2 days ago and am currently being treated for shingles.  I am a runner, and ever since I got the 1st covid vaccine shot, my running performance has been worse... my pace per mile is about 20% worse (consistently) since the 1st shot.  I feel like it did something to my immune system and am still getting over it.

I thought they were bug bites and I wasn&#39;t sure where all the pain was coming from and I ended up in the emergency room where I was diagnosed with shingles. After my second shot I started getting shingles by laterally on my right side, but I was already on medication so it didn&#39;t get that bad. I also have a lot of joint pain and burning pain in my hands and wrists that shoot up my arms and haven&#39;t stopped since the symptoms started. It&#39;s much worse at night and keeps me up from sleeping. I have also have been very forgetful and my mind is always cloudy.

                                                Pt first began to notice left leg &#34;stiffness&#34; after receiving his first COVID vaccine (Phizer) several weeks ago. Pt states that after receiving his 2nd dose on 05/06, he noticed his leg stiffness got significantly worse. He tells me that he tried to &#34;push through the pain&#34; and mow his lawn but had to stop d/t severe cramping of the LLE and pelvis. He states he rested his leg and went to bed, and when he woke up he noticed that his left leg was severely swollen. Pt decided to take 3 days off work to continue to rest the leg, but ultimately came in for evaluation at the suggestion of his coworkers. Pt denies fever, chills, chest pain, or SOB. He denies history of smoking, prior clotting, long car travel, air travel, leg injury, or recent surgery.    On exam, the left lower extremity is significantly swollen, erythematous, and hot to the touch. Physical exam otherwise unremarkable. Will admit to the hospitalist service for further medical management.   ED Course: Hypertensive with BP 170/93. Initial workup significant for WBC 13, K 3.3, glucose 159. CT chest/a/p with findings suggestive of multiple PE&#39;s of the left and right lower lobes as well as extensive LLE DVT extending slightly into the IVC. Trop &lt;0.03. BNP 66. ECG shows sinus tachycardia.

I also started experiencing my face turning red.     I had been building a playground in the backyard with power tools and plenty of sun during the unseasonably warm March, so i assumed the symptoms were related to some sort of physical strain.     However, after an appointment in April to review symptoms, and follow-up with my primary doctor in May, i&#39;m not being referred to neurology for review.   I don&#39;t have a diagnosis, only symptoms at this moment that line up closely to the vacation but also line up closely to an out door home project.   The symptoms are intermittent but are moving to more of a daily basis.

                                                Skin began to ache and became sensitive about 11 hours after vaccine was received.  Began having chills, lethargy, body aches (it felt like both inside of body and outside of skin), nausea, and high fever. Took Tylenol and Advil to attempt to alleviate symptoms. Could not get to sleep until about 12:30 a.m. and woke up at 2:30 a.m. with headache, extreme chilling, and intense body aches. I didn&#39;t know if I could walk. I put a sweatshirt and a coat on, and my teeth were chattering uncontrollably. I can&#39;t remember the last time that I was that sick. I contemplated going to the ER but didn&#39;t think I could drive. The entire day was a headache, nausea and lethargy. When at the clinic, I stated that I had heard that there could be some minor side effects with the 2nd shot and was told, &#34;Nah, people make things up.&#34; I&#39;m so glad that I&#39;m vaccinated, but people need to be forewarned of those kinds of side effects. They have to be aware because that was dangerously sick and was totally unprepared to combat it. 103&#43; degree fever and this kinds of symptoms aren&#39;t things that a person should have to try to make it through alone.

                                                After the required wait period of 15 minutes I started to drive back home which is 77 miles from the hospital that administered the vaccination.  Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

It was around 72 hours in which acute muscle soreness occurred at the injection site on my right deltoid. I thought it would resolve like the first dose after three or four days, but this seem to last longer and then it mysteriously begin to travel down my arm. It seems like every one or two days it went more distal down my right upper extremity. It first went from my deltoid to my bicep and tricep. And then a couple days later it was in my elbow and forearm. Now it has been in my elbow for weeks leaving me with weakness and pain that nothing seems to help improve it. It?s like it is in my joint at my right elbow. There is a very specific soreness and pain which has cost me a significant discomfort and weekend my strength and the entire arm.

However, 6 hours later around 4PM my Left outer ear turned bright red and get itchy (no raised or macular rash, no hives, no signs of insect bites or anything) No other redness or rashes in any other parts of my body. I did not develop any other symptoms (no SOB/difficulty breathing, etc) My R ear is fine too. I observed myself to see if the redness/itchiness will spread but after about an hour or so, the redness and itchiness went away. I did not take any antihistamine and did not I apply any hydrocortisone. Just went away on its own.  Four days later, it happened again, my L outer ear turned red again, this time it is not itchy but more like throbbing pain. It went away after 1-2 hours without any treatment.

                                                Eustachian tube dysfunction and tinnitus (constant high pitch squeal) in both ears.  It&#39;s sometimes louder than other times.  It is piercingly loud when exposed to loud noises.  It started the day after the vaccine injection. Other events are: - Frequent headaches (every 2 or 3 days).  They started the day of the injection and are current. - Sore throat.  It started 2 days after the injection and has decreased in the last few days. - Dry throat and chills.  They started a week after the injection and are current. - Soreness in the arm where injected.  This has gone away. I visited my healthcare professional about this.  No treatment was given.  The healthcare professional decided that we&#39;ll have to monitor the symptoms for any changes.  If the tinnitus gets worse or persists after a month, then it is suggested that I see an ENT (Ear, Nose, &amp; Throat) doctor.

                                                On March 24 I got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and I experienced side effects almost immediately. By the time I got to the resting/observation area I felt that the site of the injection got really warm and I became dizzy/lightheaded and started to feel heavy on the chest and little problem in swallowing and breathing. I was taken to the paramedics on site, they checked my blood pressure (which a little high 150/90), oxygenation, pulse, and EKG (which were normal). It did not became too bad after and was allowed to come back home.  However, the heavy chest and swallowing problem lasted for three days. The heaviness in the chested turned into a sensation of feeling like my trachea or the anything under the sternum area was behind strangled. Although I felt like this my breathing and swallowing was almost normal. Every now and then when I swallowed I felt some pain but I could withstand it.

                                                Felt immediate warmth in injection site. Pain at injection site. Warmth spread rapidly up my shoulder neck and around the left side of my face. Within another few minutes the warm area became slightly numb. I could move my face and feel my skin but it felt like it had gone asleep. Over the next few hours it spread down my body, only me left side, all the way to my foot. Groin area also felt numb, like when you sit on a bike too long and my penis also felt numb. Called a teledoc service on Monday as this lingered. They told me that if it had not dissapated after 2 days to let them know. Symptoms went away on Wednesday March 31st.

                                                Within 5 min of getting the shot my face became flush. That lasted for about 30 seconds. A few minutes later my neck became very itchy. This lasted for maybe a minute or two.. about an hour later my legs became very itchy. This lasted maybe a minute and was immediately followed by my face getting flush again. This also lasted about a minute. Maybe 15 minutes later the same two events repeated in the same order. Both again lasted maybe a minute.   During this time there was a little bit of tingling around my lips. This came and went for a few hours.   15 or so minutes after the 2nd round of itchy legs/face flush, my throat became itchy for a couple of minutes.   I did go to the urgent care and while was told by that doctor that as all of these had come and gone within a minute or so and that my breathing had not become an issue that I didn&#39;t need an epi shot and that I could just go home.   I didn&#39;t experience any further allergic reactions, just the expected ones.

                                                Developed a lump a little bit bigger than golf ball size under his left arm in his armpit where he got shot; Uncomfortable and irritable to put his left arm down; Area painful to the touch under his left arm and armpit where he got shot; This is a spontaneous report from a Contactable consumer (reporting himself). This is the second of 2 reports. This 43-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0150), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 05Apr2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patients medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, genetic/ chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which included asthma. The patients family medical history was none. The patient had no AEs following prior vaccination. On 05Apr2021, the patient experienced pain at the injection site of left arm and on 06Apr2021, the patient had onset of uncomfortableness under his left arm and armpit, area painful to the touch under his left arm and armpit and it was uncomfortable and irritable to put his left arm down. When the patient woke up on 07Apr2021, that the patient noticed the patient had developed a lump a little bit bigger than golf ball size under his left arm in his armpit which is painful to the touch. The patient thought it may have started to develop that lump on 06Apr2021 but did not notice the lump until morning of 07Apr2021. The patient was wondering what he should do. The patient needs to know if this was serious and the triage nurse couldn&#39;t tell him and his doctor hasn&#39;t called him back. Event was unusual because the patient has never had a bump like that lump he has at this time-caller stated bump as a descriptor of lump. The agent caller spoke to earlier advised patient that if the patient was uncomfortable or in pain to go to doctors office so patient called primary care provider who said to go in to have it checked. Caller reported the agent tells you about the symptoms and agent said that he had seen swelling of lymph nodes was one of the symptoms in his clinical trials information for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; and in those reports the swelling of lymph nodes usually goes away in about 10 days. Outcome of that event unable to be clarified as if recovered completely or with lasting effects-when queried caller reported that he did not notice any problems after that, did not have the pain at the injection site of left arm after that day or two.  No Follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

In addition, the morning after the injection I woke up with a bright red face rash and draining on the left nostril, the left eye crusted shut with yellowish drainage, a red blister-like spot on the left lower eyelid, bloodshot eye, and swelling from the eyelid and down into the cheek. The swelling got worse after a couple of days, leading to medical treatment with eye drops and an antibiotic.

I was able to walk and I was functionable before I got the COVID 19 vaccination.&#39; The patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;He was actually admitted in to hospital for 4 days, 2 weeks ago and they did lot of different lab work and medical tests, MRI, CT scans and full blood work as far as the actual individual details of what they ran, it&#39;s a long list and I don&#39;t have that handy.&#34; Further added, &#34;They gave him a lot of new medications to try to treat the burning in the skin and the nerve pain and he is also has now been admitted into an extensive long outpatient recovery program for cognition, we are working with the occupational therapy and his speech therapy.&#34; Her husband had only the first Pfizer vaccine and has severe cognitive and neurological decline within a day or so of getting it. He can&#39;t even walk unassisted. He&#39;s between a walker and a wheelchair right now and cognition is so bad that some days he can&#39;t even process how to feed himself. It was reported that the adverse events started on 11Apr2021. The patient was hospitalized for the events from Apr2021 to Apr2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test, computerised tomogram and magnetic resonance imaging, all with unknown results on Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of my memory, my cognitive skills has declined/severe cognitive and neurological decline within a day or so of getting it, neurological decline and i haven&#39;t been able to walk/can&#39;t even walk unassisted. The outcome of the events &#39;My skin feels like it&#39;s on fire all the time&#39; and very bad nerve pain was unknown, while of the rest was not recovered.

                                                extremely bad dry mouth; lips were going numb; facial numbness; rash from his neck to his nipple line; BP was 180/110 / BP stayed around 160/100; felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling; felt flush; uncomfortable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 44-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EH9899) 1st dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 in the evening time (around 6-7 or maybe a little later) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the COVID Vaccine that same day, his heart rate went up and then it came down and he was fine. Later that night while sleeping he got up again because he could feel his heart rate going up. It was not way up, but he could tell it was up. He was trying to catch an actual reading on the monitor of his heart rate, but he was not able to before it came back down. He was calling because he is wondering if this was considered a severe allergic reaction. He got the vaccine and was able to walk to his car. His mouth got dry right after the vaccine within a minute or two and noticed his heart rate went up. Treatment: He took some deep breaths and drunk water and it got better. He drove home, but that at nighttime while sleeping he noticed his heart rate went up a couple of times, but then it came back down. He could not get a reading of heart rate right away. The highest he saw on the monitor that he was able to capture was 101 and then it came back down. He was not sure if this was because he was nervous. He just had a couple of episodes that night and then nothing again. He also experienced his arm being sore from the vaccination. However, he stated that is to be expected. He stated the arm sore started a few days after getting the COVID Vaccine and then it was gone. Stated he was calling because he was concerned because Pfizer said to report any issues. He started to feel better and added this may not even be an issue. He just got concerned. Mentioned he was not sure if real side effects or if he was over thinking things. Outcome of the events was resolved.

A 44-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at a single dose on the left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 28Dec2020. Since receiving the vaccine, he has experienced multiple side effects at varying time points: pain at injection site left shoulder (experienced pain first day of receiving vaccine on 28Dec2020 and couple of days after fever (unspecified date) resolved (on an unspecified date); he was currently experiencing intermittent minimal pain especially when he wakes up; feels something is different; fever (experienced 08Jan2021); fatigue (developed 07Jan2021). He went to the ER on 08Jan2021 when he developed fever, nausea and shortness of breath which also resolved that day. When he went to ER, his CRP was up a little at 1.1. His PCR and antigen test was negative at that time (08Jan2021); a retest of PCR done 5 days after sxs started (unclear of time window) was negative. He was concerned that he had the fever many days after the vaccine. HCP was asking if any cases of fever and fatigue reported after 7 days (around the 10 day mark) of receiving the first dose. He stated that he is planning on taking the second dose. The patient is a physician calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. He received his first dose on 28Dec2020. He had a little bit of pain in his left arm on same day, but it went away. About 10 days later, 07Jan2021, he had fever and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, he went to the ER with a temp of 101. He had tachycardia, nausea and shortness of breath. He was not admitted, stated his fever was controlled and his breathing was better. His oxygen was 100% and everything was ok and he was sent home. In the ER he had xrays and labs and everything was ok, except his CRP was a bit up. In the ER he had an antigen and pcr covid test (08Jan2021) and they both came back negative. About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date. Outcome of nausea and shortness of breath was recovered on 08Jan2021, while outcome of pain at injection site left shoulder was recovered on 28Dec2020. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Left arm pain that starts  at the injection site from the second shot and then radiates down the length of the arm to the fingers causes the pinky and ring fingers to go numb . This started about 2-3 weeks after the second vaccination right after the bruise at the injection site resolved. It gets worse if I use the arm a lot . It also hurts if I don&#39;t use the arm too but not as frequently. I have demonstrably less strength in the pinky and ring fingers when comparing left to right hand. I went to the doctor and have been referred to a neurologist but the earliest appointment available is in April. No treatment for the pain was initiated until evaluation from the neurologist in April.  The pain is getting worse and the numbness in the fingers is getting worse as well as time progresses to the point  it is interfering with sleep and normal activities.

                                                After the shot, which I received on a Saturday, I developed pain and redness in my right leg. Two days later, on Monday morning, I contacted my primary care physician&#39;s office, who told me to go to the ER to be evaluated for a blood clot. At the ER, they performed a doppler ultrasound on my right leg and found a superficial clot in the greater saphenous vein of my right leg. There was no evidence of a DVT in the right leg.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

Patient presented for Pfizer covid-19 vaccine today, approx. 9 minutes post vaccination, patient reported he felt dizzy and light headed with left arm pain at injection site. Patient then began to report seeing flashes of lights, frontal headache, left arm and left leg heaviness and felt sweaty and if he was going to pass out. EMS was activated, patient was transferred to the ED.

The patient winced as the vaccine was being injected and said it was more painful than the last time he go it. He immediately stated he didn&#39;t feel well. I applied a little pressure to the injection site which he said made it feel better but he was starting to feel flushed and faint. I kept the patient in the chair and got him some water. He reported that he had experienced this before with vaccines but it had been a long time. He asked to lay on the floor so we got him into a prone position on the floor on his right side. He laid there for a few minutes then drank some more water and laid back down. After a few more minutes he was ready to sit up. He moved to a chair in our waiting area left when he felt well enough. I called patient 2 hours later to check on himand he reports he is doing fine.

Once it finished traveling, approximately 10 minutes after shot, the taste of metal appeared on the back of my tongue. The numbness passed within 15 minutes of the shot and then pain began radiating from the shot to my elbow every few minutes. I had a feeling that could be best described as inebriation after about 15 minutes and could smell pizza to be specific. There was no pizza around. This went away within about 10 minutes of onset. I slept for about 4 hours, woke up with a headache, and arm pain for 2 days.

I took a shower and 2 tablets of Benadryl Allergy prior to going to sleep.  I also contacted my primary care physician, who instructed me the next morning to continue taking one tablet of Benadryl every 6 hours.  The redness around my neck and ears was gone the next morning and the rash on my inner thighs started to disappear.  However, when I let more than 6-8 hours laps between doses of Benadryl, I would feel the itch start to return throughout my body.  This continued for roughly one week.  As of today it appears that the rash is gone and I am no longer taking Benadryl on a regular basis.  If necessary, I have pictures of the rash from the initial onset.

About a week later had trouble breathing, chest pain, felt like lungs were hurting in my back, weak, tired, couldn&#39;t catch my breath when i went upstairs and almost passed out. 2nd shot 5/04, felt pain at injection site (that was expected), that night started to get a bad headache and got worse and worse. Next morning, whole body aching, upper body, lower back, bad headache, Left underarm (lymph) swollen. 2nd day slight headache, neck ache, left underarm swollen. That night had rash on arms, chest, and stomach. 3rd day, nighttime rash arms, chest, stomach. Still red where band aid was over injection site. Over a week later still have redness shape of band aid, Seems I have sensitive skin since the 2nd covid shot. 10 days after 2nd shot I still have redness the shape of the Band Aid on my left arm. Got a red spot on my nose (looks like Rosacea). 4 weeks later, still have a red spot on my nose. I have itchiness between fingers left hand, on my face left side, neck, arms (left wrist, right arm in places) redness on chest, and rashes on back, left buttocks, and itchiness on legs. i noticed that it gets worse at night. As far as i know i did not get the Covid Virus, i did the rapid test and regular test and both were negative. But i was very sick with my stomach and had issues breathing in late 2019 and again early 2020, took medication (antibiotics) both times.   I had to write on this form over and over again kept getting frozen with error from the PDF. Even if I hit OK, it keeps popping up and does not let me finish, so I can imagine that lots of people gave up, like I may. Pfizer 4/13/2021 EW0162. After 5pm Pfizer 5/04/2021 EW0170. After 2pm

                                                rash on arms; little restless; noticed how sore his arm was/pain in his arm; trouble sleeping/problems with sleep; felt movements in his chest at times; felt like he had COVID all over again/ if he possibly has COVID-19 again; soreness; heart rate accelerated; some swollen in lymph nodes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient) via a Pfizer sponsored program. A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Mar2021 at around 13:00 or 13:30 (at the age of 44 years old) (Lot Number: EP7534, unknown expiration) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020; sneezing and runny nose both on 21Mar2021. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that he received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Mar2021. He felt fine after receiving the vaccine, but there was little bit rash on arms just afterwards and felt maybe a little restless but felt fine and went for a walk on 22Mar2021. As the night went on, he really noticed how sore his arm was/pain in his arm and when he was sleeping, he had trouble sleeping/problems with sleep (Mar2021) and felt movements in his chest at times (Mar2021). It felt like he had COVID all over again and had chills, soreness, and his smell was kind of gone in Mar2021. He was previously feeling pretty good. He had COVID-19 in Nov2020, and his symptoms feel very similar including loss of sense of smell but no coughing. He had a fever but that has gone away in Mar2021 and he did not take aspirin or anything for it. He also had fatigue, some swollen in lymph nodes, and his heart rate accelerated in Mar2021.  He had sneezing and runny nose the day prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient would like to know if his symptoms are related to the vaccine or if he possibly has COVID-19 again.  His symptoms are the same as COVID as far as what he can see, and his symptoms are really high. He would like to know if he can still receive the second dose of the vaccine if he has a positive COVID test after the first dose of the vaccine. The patient mentioned that there was very pretty high percentage of people having the symptoms after having the vaccine, kind of virus &#34;causing&#34;.  The patient asked if he needs to be tested to see if he had the virus before he was vaccinated and to know if these are one of the side effects or one of the symptoms of the virus, and to make sure that these are not actually corona virus. The patient recovered from fever in Mar2021, while unknown outcome for the remaining events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Client came in on 6/9/21 at 10:45 AM asking to speak with a nurse about a possible vaccine reaction. Nurse went outside to talk to client. Interpreter was present. Client reported that approximately 48 hours after his second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, he began noticing small red marks on both arms. The rash was not on any other body part. The client still had the rash on arms today (6/9/21), 15 days after his second vaccine. The client denied any other symptoms. The client also denied being short of breath or having difficulty breathing. Client denied any abnormal side effects from his first dose of the vaccine. The client has no known allergies, denies any prescription medication, and has no significant medical history. The client did not contact a care provider due to lack of insurance. The client also took Benadryl for the rash but stopped because he ?didn?t like the way it made (him) feel?. We discussed the situation with Nurse. Nurse called to find the nearest health center that takes clients without insurance. Nurse then educated client about the need to see a primary care provider, as we cannot give medical advice since we are a vaccination site. Client was provided with phone number and address of Medical Services. Client departed in positive disposition and stated that he was going to ?call and make an appointment? at the health center.

It was getting bigger up to about 0.8x0.8cm size with itching and red color. It lasted for 40min. After I was given two tablets of the anti-allergy medicine, the rash gradually became smaller and disappeared 30min later.

No shortness of breath but do have some slight burning to hands and legs with mild pain.

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2.

At about 29-30 hours, noticed mild numb feeling along right jawline from middle of mouth to right ear, and around the right ear. By morning (about 48 hours post vaccination), numb feeling appears gone on right jawline, but seems to have moved to left jawline (still mild). No trouble breathing or eating at all. Consulted primary care doctor out of concern over odd sensation, but not treatments at this time. Considering taking a benadryl tablet just to see if it has any effect.

A 45-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3247) intramuscular on the right arm on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications included supplements and vitamins. The patient got the COVID Vaccine on the 21st of January the Pfizer one and the following day he felt fine but he has this weird rash on that arm on his forearm, on the top of the elbow and then he kind of started on the other arm and then on the legs a little bit, around his belly and then his tongue looked like he has swollen taste buds or something, but he said he felt fine but the reporter don&#39;t if that&#39;s a side effect. &#34;Should he be worried, should he go to a doctor?&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;Because we weren&#39;t sure what it was, he did take one Benadryl like the ones you find at the drug store and then that was it. And then I put Calamine lotion, so topically couple times just to prevent him from scratching but not regularly just when he feels really, really itchy.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

Significant pain within 2 to 3 hours post injection. I could barely move the arm for about 5 days due to overwhelming pain. There were no visual symptoms from this injury. It began resolving after about 5 days and has mostly resolved but I still have some discomfort in the shoulder joint after more than 3 weeks.

                                                Dull pain at the injection site; second shot seemed fairly high on my shoulder/ pain at injection site and general shoulder area was severe; I could&#39;nt move my arm at all due to pain; barely sleep due to shoulder pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot number: EL9266, Expiration Date: Not provided) via unspecified route on 16Feb2021 at 09:45 AM in the left arm as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history included shoulder injury due to fall (5 years ago). Concomitant medications were none.The patient previously took Ibuprofen and Amoxicillin and experienced allergies, also historical vaccine includes on 26Jan2021 at 10:00 AM, the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot number: EN5318, Expiration Date: Not provided) via unspecified route in the left arm as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines in four weeks. On 16Feb2021 at 15:00, the patient experienced pain at the injection site, &#34;barely sleep due to shoulder pain&#34;, shoulder injury. Clinical course of the event as follows: On 16Feb2021, about 5 hours after the shot in the left arm, patient started feeling the typical dull pain at the injection site, about at 11pm (13 hours after injection) the pain at injection site and general shoulder area was severe. About 9 out of 10 he could barely sleep due to shoulder pain. Patient couldn&#39;t move his arm at all due to pain. The pain began receding about 24-36 hours later till 8 days after injection, he still had shoulder pain when he moves arm a certain way. It was reported that it felt like a shoulder injury for him. It was further stated that, the same shoulder was injured mildly about 5 years ago due to a fall but made a full recovery a couple months later. The patient informed that pain after first shot was only mild dull pain at injection site. Also, of note is that the injection site for second shot seemed high on shoulder as opposed to the side of the deltoid for the first shot. Events were not treated. Outcome of events was resolving.

                                                Within 4hrs of receiving the 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine I began to experience ringing in the ears followed by onset of extreme headaches and body aches somewhat dissimilar from the flu. These aches felt like painful internal construction of the head neck back and thigh muscles. Severe pain in the left arm where I received the jab.  I was extremely fatigued and could barely make it from bed to the bathroom. I treated the condition with Tylenol 1g every 4hrs followed by 200mg of Motrin. I also ensured adequate fluid hydration and electrolytes 120&#43; oz per day. The symptoms continued for about 36hrs. I began to feel better but 48hrs later I relapsed with the onset of ringing ears then headache followed by extreme fatigue. I treated the 2nd round with continued bed rest over 3 days with Tylenol (1g) and Motrin (400mg). I eliminated Tylenol day 2. I reduced Motrin to half on Day 3. I felt better for 48hrs and again relapsed but only needed smaller 200mg doses of Motrin for a day along with bed rest. The ringing in the ears have been consistent since the onset of the symptoms 4hrs after receiving the 2nd shot. The ringing is greater when I?m active and late in the day. The ringing in the ears is less after min of 6hrs full sleep during the night. I have yet to be able to exercise since racing that 2nd dose. I?m slowly progressing in reducing the fatigue by consuming 30mL shots of ginger juice daily along with 500mcg of  Vitamin B12 as directed by my Dr.

Warm water made it worse. Worst areas on knuckles and near his elbows along with the back of his neck. Took Benadryl with no resolution.  He saw his doctor on Monday, and received a steroid shot and prescriptions for prednisone and hydroxyzine. By April 2, he was almost done with his Medrol dose pack and felt much better. He felt pretty normal by his call to the health dept. On April 7.

Extreme pain in my calf, my foot immediately lost its color and no pulses could be detected in my ankle or foot.  Rushed to ER by ambulance.  Vascular surgeon diagnosed it as simultaneous arterial thrombosis in the posterior tibial artery, anterior tibial artery, and fibular artery of the lower right leg.  Admitted to the ICU, treatment was heparin drip for 3 days until all 3 clots cleared and all foot pulses were detectable.

                                                I had chicken for dinner at about 5:30 in the evening and within fifteen minutes, I start to itch all over and then I broke out into hives on my hands, neck, shoulders, back and sides. I thought at first that I was just having an allergic reaction to the vaccine so I took two benedryl and the hives went down the following day. I had chicken two days later and the same thing happened. I only realized that this was a chicken allergy on April 16th 2021. Each time the allergic reaction was more intense and lasted longer. I am now apprehensive about taking the second dose of the same vaccine as I am not sure whether or not this will intensify the adverse reaction and amplify the food allergy.

                                                2 days after my second shot I broke out in Hives and welts down my torso, Arms, and legs. I went to urgent care and they gave me a shot of prednisone and gave me a pack of the same steroid to take over the next 6 days they also prescribed some prescription Claritin and Famotidine.. The following day 4/16/21 around 1130pm I woke up to my face being swollen as well as my tongue. I was taken to the ER where the triage unit gave me epinephrine as well as another steroid to stabilize the swelling as I was having trouble breathing. Once stabilized I was released and took 50 mg of Benadryl every 6 hours as well as the Claritin, famotidine, and the prednisone. I had hives for a few days after and followed up with my primary doctor, but as of today I feel like i am back to normal.

A 45-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 01Apr2021 (Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and  concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 01Apr2021 and experienced a raging rash 24 hours later (02Apr2021), still had the rash, he was due for second dose on 23Apr2021. He&#39;s had this rash 13 plus days. The rash started on his right arm, not the arm where he received the Covid 19 vaccine. The rash was super itchy, super annoying. The rash did spread to his other arm. He did see his doctor as soon as he could. His doctor told him maybe the rash was related to the Covid 19 vaccine, maybe it&#39;s herpes zoster, maybe it&#39;s contact dermatitis, it&#39;s probably not the Covid 19 vaccine. His primary care doctor prescribed him a topical steroid, Clobetasol and Benadryl for itching. He then saw a dermatologist. The dermatologist took a closer look and decided to prescribe an oral steroid, Prednisone, he&#39;s on his second day of taking the Prednisone. The dermatologist told him to get the second Covid 19 vaccine even if his rash isn&#39;t resolved by then but the first doctor her saw said he might need to worry about anaphylaxis. That&#39;s scary. He wanted to get the second Covid 19 vaccine. He stated maybe his body started making all these T-cells the next thing he knew he had this rash.  He stated his PCP and dermatologist advised him to call Pfizer regarding the treatment of his rash, he wanted Pfizer to recommend what to do to get rid of the rash. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Upon injection, felt immediate soreness at injection site (left arm, near shoulder). Had also felt soreness after first shot in series, which went away. Ten weeks after the second shot, I still feel considerable soreness at the injection site, which sometimes increases from general soreness to mild pain. A specific example is a general difficulty sleeping on my left side, which will wake me with pain and often cause mild pain for the remainder of the day.

                                                I get my first dose of COVID Pfizer vaccine on May 11, 2021, then 5 days later on May 16, about 20 small blisters (herpes) appeared on each inner side of both my arms,  which have not gone away so far.  Today, I went to the pharmacy to get a second dose of vaccine. After telling the pharmacy staff about my side effects, they asked me to report the side effects to you and wait for the results before getting the second dose.

By 5/11 the petechiae developed into thrombocytopenia purpura with a platelet count fo 1000, including mouth lesions and prolonged mucosal bleeding. Admitted Hospital for treatment on 5/11. Treatment included a high dose of oral dexomethasone for four days, IVIG transfusion for two days, and a single platelet transfusion. Fluid developed in the lungs, but that was determined to be a byproduct of treatment, and not part of the adverse reaction. By the time of discharge on 5/14, platelet count had risen to 88000. One week later at outpatient, platelet count had risen to 180000.

The patient previously took, humatrope for adult growth hormone deficiency, synthroid for low thyroid level, allopurinol (ELAVIL) and experienced drug hypersensitivity, metformin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, Cytomel 5 mcg. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On an unspecified date in 2021 the patient had whole body rash. On 22Apr2021 12:00 he initially got a rash around the injection site, which he heard was to be expected (COVID Arm). However, he has developed rashes over my entire body. These rashes developed gradually. First, it was the rash around the injection site, but that went away. Then, a rash developed further down the arm that he received the vaccine in (Left Arm), including on my hand. he has since developed rashes on my abdomen, right arm, thighs, legs and feet. he also has a breakout on my back. he submitted a report on the side effects (whole body rash) that he experiencing as a result of getting both shots of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. he has whole body rashes that have developed since he got the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

Furthermore, How do patient get compensated for the money patient was out of pocket to treat patient whole body rash. Furthermore, patient also need to know how patient would be compensated for the money patient have paid out of pocket and would pay out of pocket in the future due to the rashes patient have developed.

Patient was enrolled in the HyPOCCS study, which covered the cost of the testing, as well as the treatment of the eventual diagnosis of AGHD. Patient was started on Humatrope later in 1998. Of course, Patient was also taking my testosterone replacement as well. Later on, when patient switched to another Endocrinologist closer to where patient live, he diagnosed patient with a low thyroid level. Patient was started on Synthroid, however, there was low T4 to T3 conversion. As a result, patient was also put on 5 mcg of Cytomel. Of course, this Endocrinologist was also treating my other hormone deficiencies as well. The seriousness of the events was reported as non-serious. Outcome of the events was not resolved.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

That condition lasted until late on the evening of 7 Jan.  As of 8 Jan, all symptoms have resolved and I feel fine.

                                                I have never had a seizure in my life before or since, but that morning I had five partial focal seizures in y right arm, over the course of six minutes.  As I was on the phone (to report the first one to my caregiver) when the second hit, I inadvertently punched myself rapidly and repeatedly in the right side of my head, with the phone handset functioning as an impromptu bludgeon, leaving bruises reminiscent of the victim of a fist fight.  Also at the time I had a strong headache, cold chills, a 102 degree Fahrenheit fever and body aches.  None of which persisted beyond noon.

In the evening of the same day, around 7h30 PM while I was sitting on a table talking to my parents, I had a nosebleed, not very bad, just about 10 drops of blood. I had not had nosebleed for  8 or 10 years before that night. I thought it might be because of the dryness in my house, humidity dropped to 30%  from the normal range of 40%-60%. However, last night (Tuesday night) around the same time 7:00pm ~ 7:30pm, I had a nosebleed again while having dinner with my family, a bit less blood dropping this time, but it makes me worried a little bit.    Other than the nosebleed, I don&#39;t have any other symptoms, the soreness on the injection arm is close to nothing and I usually forgot about it.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 46-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 12:15 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient reported that he felt fine after the shot for the rest of the day and the first night other than the soreness where he received the shot. The patient went to bed around 11 pm and woke up the next day (14Jan2021) at around 6:30 am with very bad dizziness. He felt like his eyes were rolling around in his head which made him very nauseous and sick to his stomach. His wife called a friend who is a nurse and she said to keep an eye on him for a little while and see how he was in an hour or so. She said that if it gets worse call 911 otherwise get him to the clinic at 10 am. He reported that he was feeling much better by then but went to clinic at 10 and doctor saw him asked questions gave me something for nausea and dizziness. He felt good the rest of the day with slight lightheaded. He mentioned that he needs get his second shot on 03Feb2021 and was concerned about getting it. He inquired on what is the recommendation on getting dose #2. It was not reported if the patient been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received treatment for the adverse events. They gave me ondansetron (ZAFRAN ODT [orally disintegrating tablets]) 4 mg for nausea. The patient considered the events was non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date with sequelae (recovered with lasting effects).

That night, the arm pain became more severe such that anytime I moved the pain would wake me.  I could not lift my arm without severe pain until around 1800 the following day.  On 11 Feb, I began to have a low fever around 1000.  The fever stayed between 99.0F - 99.8F and persisted until around 1800 that evening.  After 1800 on 11 Feb, all symptoms rapidly resolved and I was only left with very minor injection site pain by the morning of 12 Feb.

                                                Received shot at 08:20 on Thursday. By 12:00 I was feeling sluggish and rundown. At 06:00 (Friday), I woke with a massive pressure headache, malaise, very sore left arm (where the injection was), and a fever of 100.2. Tylenol at 06:20 seems to have broken fever, still feel very rundown and the headache is debilitating.  It is 10:00 hrs. as I fill this out. The Tylenol made no difference to the headache.

                                                I woke up on 1/9/2021 with my lower left leg swollen and red and DR said it could be a superficial blood clot. January 9  - ER - Diagnosed cellulitis - round of Ceflex for a week - things got worse. Since January 9, I&#39;ve had two other separate ER visits and three rounds of CEFLEX. Was referred to Dermatology - Arrhythmia Nodusem  - so now I&#39;m off Ceflex and on a steroid regimen now. I just started it today. It hurts to even touch my skin and it hurts to walk.I&#39;m in  a lot of pain. I have no open wounds so no reason for this to happen.

Itching and swelling subsided with a dose of Loratadine. Nausea worsened that night and vomiting ensued with diarrhea worsening. At bedtime, itching returned, sleeplessness, vomiting and sweating profusely from the scalp and face, slight difficulty filling lungs with air. Another dose of Loratadine calmed symptoms. Wednesday (10th) through the next Thursday (18th ), nausea persisted, but eased with Benadryl and Emerton. Diarrhea persisted through Monday (15th). No fever, no soreness, no headache.

                                                Sunday, March 14th, noticed red itchy bumps on back of left leg.  Tuesday, March16th, noticed red bumps on chest and stomach, immediately following a run.  Wednesday, March 17th, noticed red bumps on chest, stomach, back, groin, arms, and neck.  Thursday, March 18th, no change red bumps appear to be spreading.  Friday, March 19th, red bumps appear to be spreading and more prevalent in left groin area, bumps appear to be travelling down left arm towards direction of left hand.  Bumps are not that itchy, but do have an occasional itchiness on a scale of 1 to 10, about a 1 or 2 with itch.  Per the recommendation of Urgent Care, I am taking Benadryl, but only taking one pill at night before bedtime and there appears to be no improvement.

                                                Within hours of  second dose(3/10/2021) in the right arm on 3/11/2021 I started feeling pain on the underside of my left arm. As the days have gone on it?s gotten a little worse. Left under arm pain, armpit area, left chest (pectoral) pain. Just lingering pain. Very sensitive to the touch. I also developed a rash on the left side of my spine between the shoulder blades. It  showed up this past weekend or the end of last week. It?s more of a painful rash than itchy. It?s very uncomfortable to lean against or lay on.  This is all 13 days after the second shot. I have just been taking ibuprofen for the pain.  Going to see my doctor today.

                                                Woke up at 3/29/2021 with severe itching, flat reddened patches on arms, chest, back and legs. I also had and raised reddened (pea to dime sized) hives on my arms, legs and chest.  I thought that it was an allergic reaction to several insect bites from being outdors Sunday evening for about an hour. Allegra and Zyrtec didn&#39;t help the itching very much, so I&#39;ve been taking Allegra every 10 hours and Benadryl every 6 hours for the past 48 hours.  When the Benadryl wears off the hives return become raised, red and very itchy.  I didn&#39;t think that it could be from the vaccine because I didn&#39;t really have any issues other than local swelling and itching at the ilocal area of the vaccine njection site.  I&#39;ve also been treating the hives with topical Hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl cream.

It was a little itchy. After the second shot (the one I report) it became larger and painful. And several other spots appeared (all on the left side of torso). I am trying to use 1% corticosteroid cream and over the counter anti-histamine. I am not sure if it helps because it looks like it is getting worse after four days after the vaccine.

The next day around lunch time the hives came back again I had a very red and tingling area around my neck and in my head. I returned to the walk in clinic and they gave me shot of Benadryl and prednisone and another drug I do not remember.

Narrative:  12/21 employee received vaccine at 0930 - later in the afternoon he noted tachycardia to about 100. He was watching the rate on his Apple watch. The highest rate was 130. His only other symptom was fatigue which was bad enough on 12/22 that he had to go home. He saw his PCP on 12/22 for the tachycardia who ordered labs which were all normal. He is a resident so he asked anesthesia to do an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia. On 12/23 his heart rate average went down to 100. Today (12-28) his resting heart rate is 70-80 which is his baseline. He has not had recurrence of the tachycardia since 12/23. He also reports he had soreness at the injection site and myalgias both of which have since resolved.

A 47-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), unknown on 18Dec2020 (lot number: EK5730) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Caller is a Physician Assistant. Caller states that she is calling about the Covid Vaccine. She had a patient received his first dose of the vaccine on Friday 18Dec2020, 3 days later on 21Dec2020 he had an urticarial rash that persisted, The urticarial rash was treated with prednisone and resolved by 27Dec2020, it has not reoccurred. The allergist said it was a delayed hyper sensitive reaction that was Prompted by the immune simulation from the vaccine. The Patient was treated for the urticaria.  Caller would like to know if a patient experienced an allergic reaction to the first dose is there anything prophylactically needing to be done when administering the second dose of the Covid vaccine? Caller is very upset and frustrated and stating she wants to speak to someone that is a clinician with the clinical trial team who can give her recommendations for a specific patient. Caller asks if they should do Prophylaxis with antihistamines for the second dose. He did not have anaphylaxis but he had angioedema. Caller states that she did a Vaers report on 22Dec2020, but no one contacted her. He started taking Zyrtec and Vistaril. The Allergist said it was fine and he will still need the 2nd Booster Dose. The Angioedema started on 22Dec2020, it was also treated with prednisone, in addition to being administered Benadryl IM, and Vistaril. The outcome of the event urticarial rash was recovered on 27Dec2020 and Angioedema was recovered on 22Dec2020.   No follow-up attempts are needed; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the angioedema and the other reported events due to temporal relationship.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

Two days after second shot pain from shingles increased and new vesicles formed. Second rash has been less severe than first so far but pain is equal to that at the time of the first rash.

Waited 20-40 more minutes, then felt dizzy and began to have hives in addition to previous reactions. I went to Urgent Care where they took vitals. Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated, throat was abnormal, and I had hives. They gave me antihistamine and steroid shot.  After 30minutes - and hours, vitals returned to normal.

Then on the 3rd day, a few small pimples showed up in that area, near the belt line.  Then on the 4th day, the pimples started to look more like a rash.  Then on the 4th day the rash became raised and looked more like boils.  On the 6th day, I went to the doctor and they believe it is shingles.  Started antiviral treatment for shingles on the sixth day.  This entry is being made on the 7th day, one day into the shingles antiviral treatment.  Never had shingles before.  Also, migraine headache started on the 7th day, but this is not uncommon for me.

                                                About a week after receiving the shot a set of spots appeared on my ankles, and over the next week or so grew more numerous and spread to my feet, with numerous blisters appearing.  The area around the spots gets painful in the evenings.  After a doctor&#39;s visit, leading to blood tests and a biopsy, I was diagnosed with IgA vasculitis.   My understanding is that IgA vasculitis can be associated with a reaction to vaccines, although to my knowledge it has not yet been reported in connection with a COVID-19 vaccine.  My doctor advised, &#34;IgA vasculitis has not been reported so far with the Covid vaccine that I could find in the literature.  It has been reported in association with Covid infection and some other vaccines though, so it stands to reason that it may be related.&#34;   The symptoms have not yet abated as I am still in the 14-day window after my second vaccination shot, and my doctors have advised to hold off on taking immunosuppressant steroids until that time period elapses.

                                                feeling of swelling in tongue and lower lip. Scratchy feeling also in same areas. Started about 25 minutes after shot on drive home. Took allegra and it went away in 30-60 minutes. Tongue was sore the next day.  I also suffered a mild anxiety attack at the same time. Treatment for that was meditation and cessation of throat swelling symptoms.  Lastly, I also had a severe flare up of my fibromyalgia symptoms in my forearms starting 3 days after the injection. I don&#39;t know if this was a primary effect from the vaccine, or secondary from the additional nociceptive input from the joint and muscle pain I was experiencing in my forearms. I increased my lyrica to compensate. Two weeks out from the shot I&#39;m almost back to baseline.

The site had a little bleeding as the male nurse adminiter the dose.  Redness faded but circular yellowish discoloration about 2 inches in diameter is still visible on left arm after 7th day.   2. Eyes started itching the first shot and left eye had itchy corner like dry skin or something.  Itchiness faded then came back again after second shot.  Same reaction, itchy eyes the next day and the left eye corner started itching and drying up.  Applied 1% cortizone to relieve itchiness and dryness on 3rd day.  Seem to have releived the itchiness and dryness but still monitoring it.   Will report this reaction with my provider when I see them next week,

                                                Approximately two weeks after receiving the vaccine I developed Shingles. My symptoms started as a sore/tender area in the center of my right collarbone and a red bump behind and slightly above my right ear that spread until the right side of my neck and head were covered in a thick set of rashes. It took about five days for the rash to fully develop.    I do not have an autoimmune disorder or any  other medical condition that would lower my immunity. I have not been under any undue stress nor am I recovering from a recent illness. I am also not immuno-compromised in any way that I am aware. I had a physical in February with no issues identified. I did have chicken pox as a kid.

Patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the Pfizer vaccine. On 30Apr2021, had a little bit of pain, normal, where the shot was. From that time, about 1-2 times per week he had pain in that left arm. Pain had been progressively constant on 0-8 pain scale for the site where the shot was put in his arm. He called the CDC, just came from his doctor&#39;s office. He was following CDC protocols implemented on this. He had to get bloodwork-clarified he had bloodwork drawn today; doctor wanted him to get an ultrasound done on his arm and start steroids as prescribed. As soon as he got the shot, he felt some...what he thinks was an indication of he got a shot-his body protecting itself from foreign body. About a week later he started to develop more pain in that area and then it progressively got worse, throbbing. He just had an appointment with his doctor&#39;s PA at 08:30 this morning on 01Jun2021. He just had bloodwork drawn but had no information for that or any other relevant testing/investigations done to provide for report. He received second dose of Covid-19 Vaccine, which he verified as being Pfizer-BioNTech product from CDC vaccine record card, on 30Apr2021. He reported pain starting that day and progressively worsening. He asked how long this side effect is going to take, who is going to pay for this process because supposedly he has to pay for this; but this is basically a clinical trial and when in a clinical trial the company pays for this, right? He also mentioned that his first dose of Covid-19 Vaccine was on 31Mar2021, and second dose of Covid-19 Vaccine was on 30Apr2021; so, second dose administered 30 days after first dose. He reported that kept him within the 6-week window. The outcome wof the events was not recovered.

Tried warm shower and OTC Meds but no change.  It was no better Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.  Went to hospital ER on Sunday 3/22 for x-ray etc. and diagnosed with calcification tendinitis.   Received 800mg Ibuprofen script.  Feeling slightly better today with more range of motion but still cannot lift arm much.  Still very painful at the core of the joint.

He stated he felt exhausted the whole time but had little sleep, which was helped by the dextromethorphan hydrobromide, doxylamine succinate, ephedrine sulfate, ethanol, paracetamol for a few hours. He reported today (as of 22Mar2021) was the first day in a few that he&#39;d felt alive enough to report. The blisters/rash were about the same, &#34;but the blisters.&#34; The events required a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The clinical outcomes of pain in my neck and left shoulder, sore muscles, cluster of small blisters, splotchy red rash, felt very unwell, headache, fever, chills, exhausted, and had little sleep were reported as recovering.

Evolved into joint pain that would not resolve with medication.   Developed a loss of range of motion and pain that mimicked a rotator cuff tear.  This worsened over months.  Doctor prescribed meds and PT.  After PT I suffered a partial tear of the biceps tendon.  MRI pending.  Shoulder pain improved after the tear.

Probably SIRVA is my guess (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration). Pain is getting worse not better and will be following up soon with primary doctor. Hurts to move left arm when utilizing muscle at injection site.

                                                1) Pain around the location of the first shot.  The pain went away after a couple of days. 2) Chills, fatigue, and body ache after the second shot.  They all went away after 2 days.  However, 2 days ago (June 2, 2021) - that is 2 months after the second shot (April 2, 2021), I started to have chills, fatigue, body ache, and some low fever (99.5), the same exact feelings that I had right after the second shot!  I took one pill of ibuprofen and it helped with the body ache.  However, fatigue did not go away until 2 days later (June 4, 2021).  I was worried and thought I had caught covid, so I got tested, and the result was negative!  Today, June 4, 2021, I got up and felt like myself again!    What is the possibility that the side effect keeps coming back like this?  I asked the nurse, who informed me about my negative result, this question, and she said that I might have caught a bug!  I told her that it was unlikely I would have recovered quickly if that had happened!

                                                Background, I had Covid back at the end of May/beginning of June with 1 week of constant fevers (with 500mg tylenol q6), shortness of breath, fatigue, but no real cough. O2 sats somtimes in low 90&#39;s . I am one of the radiology faculty at the hospital I work at. Received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday Dec 18 at about 21:30. After the injection, I had moderate pain at the site of injection about 6 hours later, not unexpected. However, the next evening, I was feeling fatigued and went to bed at about 7 p.m. For the next three hours, I felt chills and finally at about 10 p.m. I took my temp after I felt that my fever had &#34;broke&#34; and temp was 101.9. Used a finger pulse ox just to make sure sats were ok, they were at 97%, but unexpectedly, resting heart rate was 130 bpm. I took some tylenol and called the ER, and they suggested calling the covid hotline pager and coming in if I did not improve. I called the hotline pager, and we discussed things and eventually decided that I should go to the ER as temp remained at 101.6. By the time I reached the ER, my temp was down to 100.8, but pulse still 122 (EKG with no other abnormalities) and BP was 165/100. I had no other symptoms to account another infection. Over the next two hours, vitals became more normal with HR down to 95 to 100, and BP down to 145/85 or so without any other intervention.  Sunday, still with some mild low grade temps of 99.8, but heart rate at 85 to 90 (I&#39;m usually at about 80).   In the ER, we came to the conclusion that my body mounted a significant immune response to the production of antigens after processing the mRNA given the lack of alternative diagnosis and the improvement of sx without any other intervention besides the 500 mg of tylenol I took before coming in.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EL0142) intramuscularly at right shoulder approximately at 17:30 on 29Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity (a little over weight but he is fit). The patient had COVID in the end of Apr2020. The patient had no family medical history and had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no concomitant medication. The second day of the vaccination, the patient called to report body aches, headache, chills, low grade temperature. As he reported, he just woke up and was walking around feeling like he had 1000 pounds on his back and felt like crap. The body aches started in his shoulder and currently all over his neck, back and whole body aches. Chills started last night (vaccination night). He was just trying to get to sleep and had to put an extra sweatshirt on last night. He did not check his temperature until he got up and it was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit. He was not able to provide a start date for the temperature. &#34;Body aches, headache between, chills between, low grade temperature (unspecified start date), feels like crap&#34; were considered developing between 24:00-01:00. He stated that they were all medically significant and he needs a day to recover hopefully. He just felt like he was hit by a truck. The patient had not visited physician or went to ER yet. The outcome of low grade temperature was unknown, chills was resolving and all other events did not resolve at the time of reporting.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events vaccination site pain, headache, chills, and pyrexia were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. The association between the other reported events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded based on temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I am a physician and understand the purpose of the vaccine and how it works.

Those symptoms persisted for approximately 12 hours after which I continued to experience injection site pain, but began to experience pain with some numbness that radiated from the injection site distally down my arm and into my pinky and ring fingers on my left hand.  No other symptoms.  As of today the injection site pain persists as does the pain and numbness in my pinky and ring fingers, but I get the feeling that it is getting slightly worse.  The pain and slight numbness is present when I awake, but gets worse throughout the day.  Some evenings there is considerable discomfort.

This is the first of two reports.  This physician which was a 49-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on the right deltoid 17Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated that he received the first dose of the COVID vaccine and he had a pretty bad rash that started 3 days after (noted on 20Dec2020). The rash has since improved since it started but it took forever to improve and mentioned that he was super itchy at night. He also used to be itchy in the day, but now it was just at nigh which was driving him insane. The physician also mentioned that it was a raised maculopapular rash. It started on his neck on the left side as well and increased of both elbows and behind his knees (it was diffuse). He mentioned that he was able to carry on during the day, but he cannot sleep great. He mentioned that it reminded him of poison ivy - the thought of it happening again makes him want to cringe especially with all the terrible stuff he has seen he was scared that his skin will slough off or its going to kill him or something. But overall, he was more concerned about the itching. The physician took over the counter antihistamines and hydrocortisone cream. He did take one dose of expired liquid prednisone (from 5 years ago that his daughter who had for an ear infection). He downed a sip of prednisone and it prevented his itchiness for a day and now was thinking of getting on steroids. The physician also stated that there was one guy he worked with had something similar (AER 2021010285). He received the same lot number and has been itching like crazy. They have both been trying to figure out what to do. It was clear as mud. Then, last week (Jan2021) they saw each other, and they were both having the same issue and suffering separately. They had no exposure to anything similar besides the vaccine. The physician stated that he was about due for 2nd shot. He has been researching and trying to figure out what to do, if he should get the second dose or not. He reported this to VAERs and talked to CDC, but nobody has any recommendations or information. He also tried to look up trial data to see if anyone had reported a similar rash, and he did not find anything. He was calling to see if he should get the second dose, and if Pfizer has any information on this rash being reported. Outcome of pruritic rash was not recovered; recovering from maculopapular rash and unknown for the remaining event. As per causality: He was unsure. It was most likely from the vaccine as he has done nothing differently.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

                                                Allergic reaction that occurred 7 days after receiving the first vaccination.  Treated for anaphylactic shock at local ER and released.  Anaphylactic shock returned within 24 hours causing second visit to the ER.  I was then transported to  hospital for ICU admission.  Body broke out with hives rash for several days followed by severe joint swelling.  Remained in ICU 3 days and was released to see Allergist.

                                                On Dec 22, I had my Pfizer vaccine. I only had some injection site sore/pain until 5 days later when I started to have papular rash and vesicles in the areas around the injection site. The involved area got extensive from shoulder to thumb from day 6 to day 12. The rash is only limited to the arm receiving the vaccine injection. Then I have low fever and weakness for two days. I just started to feel better this morning (post injection day 14).  I attached photos of my arm to show the rash. Confirmed by dermatologist as VZV positive on 1/5/2021. They did a biopsy and viral testing.

                                                I am a physician who received the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in my right arm on 1-13-21. On 1-14-21 I developed deep aching right sided neck pain distinct from the injection site pain, and this progressed to right cervical radiculopathy, with 12-15 hours of radicular pain radiating from my right neck through my right hand.  The best way to describe this is it felt like a tooth ache from my neck to my hand.       That is not why I&#39;m writing.  I&#39;m writing  because around 2-9-2021 I developed a pruritic rash near my right wrist that I originally thought was contact dermatitis,  but I could not recall the initial contact.  The rash persisted, and 2-13-21 it spread, began to crust, and started burning, consistent with shingles in the C8 distribution. I&#39;m a 49 year old quacks-like-a-duck  doctor,  and wanted to share my story due to the possible connection between the Pfizer mRNA vaccine and herpes zoster.

Tuesday evening, my wife noticed that I am not fully blinking/closing my right eye; Feb 17, 2021 Wednesday, I didn&#39;t have the same pain but there&#39;s numbness on my right cheek extending to my right lips.  Wednesday afternoon around 2pm, I went to my dentist thinking it was due to my Invisalign which I started on Jan 25, 2021.  The dentist told me it is most likely Bell&#39;s palsy so I decided to go to Emergency.

                                                Early Wednesday morning (2/24) around 5:00AM, I woke up to extreme pain in my left arm, primarily along the upper forearm, inside of my elbow, and lower bicep. There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They&#39;ve prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week. The right arm pain is less than the left arm pain, but at this point seven days later, I am experiencing neuropathic pain in both arms.

                                                Developed prickly feeling and slight rash...perhaps some mild hives about 11 hours after the vaccine.  I also felt like I had a bit of a lump in my throat. I called the Doctor&#39;s office and spoke with a nurse who suggested I take Benadryl.  I did so at around midnight and that seemed to take care of things.  Went to bed and woke up the next morning feeling ok (though groggy from the Benadryl).

A 49-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported) via unspecified route of administration in the arm right on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced drug allergy; also received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EJ1685) via unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: clinic. It was reported that on 23Jan2021, couple of days after the second shot, patient experienced skin on hands and the bottom of my feet started to peel off and bleeding and very painful in the fingers and the feet.  The events resulted in both: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and Emergency room/department or urgent care. It was unknown if treatment received for the events. Outcome of all events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship and known drug profile, a contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded in the development of bleeding, skin exfoliation and pain in extremity.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                1 hour after receiving the vaccine,  my face and neck on the side of the shot started to burn like a nerve issue and then went numb. My arm where I received the shot went cold and burned. A friend came over and took the temperature of my hand because it was cold and it was 15 degrees colder than my other hand. I took 1 Benadryl of 25mg and laid down for a few hours. At around 4 hours after the vaccine my neck went stiff as well as my upper back. I am reporting this because I don&#39;t believe the neck and face going numb is a normal thing and it was concerning and had it continued I would have went to the ER. I am not sure if the Benadryl helped but maybe.

They are worse in the early morning and brought on my rapid head movement while in bed.  Symptoms remain throughout the day and are triggered by rapid movement (standing quickly).   Severe enough that upon onset I am unable to stand and must come to the ground to seek stability.  Also experiencing mild cold sweats during these attacks.  Minor injection site pain was experienced but subsided after 48 hours.

On his way down he hit his head on the shelf and cut his head in 2 places.  When I got to him he was still out of it and within seconds he came to.  I had him stay laying down and he was very pale and sweaty.  We called 911 and they came within 5 minutes.  In that time frame I took his BP and pulse and it was low.  Ems took him to the hospital.

Did not have additional side effects and left in 20 minutes. During driving back and 1 hr after the vaccination became even more dizzier and fatigued, with walking balance issues. Second day dizziness disappeared, but I had a pain in the area of the shot, headache, body aches, and fatigue, balance issues. 3rd day started recovering.  3-8 day side effects gradually disappeared but started having panic attacks and generalized anxiety which I suffered years ago.

He also complained that despite his protest, the person who administered the shot insisted to inject on his shoulder joint.  He developed a bigger-than-quarter-size bruise on his right inner arm the next day. He was feeling tired the following days. On May 4 around 3:30, I heard he was making loud noises. I came to his side immediately. At the time I thought he was making louder than usual snores. I nudged him gently but he didn&#39;t respond.  After about 15 seconds, the sound stopped, and he had no breath. I then called 911 within 10 seconds, tried to do CPR on him. It took EMS 6 minutes to arrive even though we live very close to a fire station in a well-accessed urban area. EMS worked on him for about 30 minutes before transported him to hospital. They continued to work on him for a while. He never regained breath.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He had his first dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on 4/23, and his symptoms began on 4/29. He was itchy all over, but when he developed fever and SOB he came to the ER on 5/2 and was discharged on prednisone. His symptoms continued and so he came back to the ER and was admitted. He had a lymph node biopsy to rule out lymphoma (pathology returned negative for lymphoma). He was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and doxycycline. He tested &#43; for EBV IGG but not IGM. EBV PCR was pending upon discharge. He had a borderline positive lyme serology. He was discharged on doxycycline and steroids with improved symptoms. He returned to the ER with again worsening SOB, night sweats, worsening rash, recurrence of fever. He denies sore throat or any sick contacts. He reports a normal appetite. He was found to be hypotensive and in AKI.

Symptoms worsened and he was admitted to ICU on May 21st via the ED for multiorgan failure including respiratory failure with R pneumonia, Shock, Renal failure, Disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock liver failure requiring invasive vent support and treatment for septic shock including vasopressor support and antibiotic therapy.  He was started on CRRT on the 22nd.  His INR continues to rise and Hb dropping consistent with worsening DIC.  Blood cultures are positive for MRSA.  He will likely die from progressive septic shock and MSOF.

This became so big and scary that I called a dermatologist and I was diagnosed with eczema. I also had headaches, felt like I had the flu but no fever.  I received my second vaccine at Hospital.   To this day I still have the lesions, using a topical cream and it spreads to my back and my arms as time goes on I have 6-7 skin lesions I am still treating.   I had eczema when I was eight years old but it seems the Pfizer vaccine triggered it.

                                                Patient was given the second dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine on 6/2/21 at 12:29pm and was asked to wait for 15 minutes to watch how the patient reacts with the vaccine. He didn&#39;t have any side effect on his first dose. After 3 minutes of getting the vaccine, his wife notified me that she needs assistance. He was sweating profusely and was about to lose consciousness. His wife and I kept saying his name to check his response. He could not response or was about to faint. His pulse is slow, and his face is red. Since there was other customers waiting for shots in the clinic, I asked the technician to ask for pharmacy manager assistance. He came in the clinic, and checked patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure. The blood pressure was high (170/89). We checked his blood pressure again, and it was lower after couple minutes. Patient started to have consciousness and understand what we are talking. He told us that he always had the same reaction after getting his blood drawn. We asked him to sit down and was monitored by us in the clinic. After 30 minutes, he said that he was feeling fine without any problems and decided to leave. He can breathe ok and didn&#39;t have any adverse reactions such as swelling of throat and lip or hives. His wife and he didn&#39;t eat anything before getting the vaccine. I checked his blood pressure again, and it was 130/80. Will follow up on him this evening and tomorrow.

The patient medical history included low testosterone, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, COVID in the past (He did not know initially he had it, he had lost of taste and smell). Concomitant medication included dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing. None prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history relevant to AEs. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. The patient experienced anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 17May2021. Time of onset (24-hour clock): Roughly 18:00. Usually he took the testosterone in the morning, but he forgot. He was wrapping up the day, took the testosterone and by 18:02 he was on the ground, cold. The patient got his vaccination last Tuesday (11May2021). He was also on testosterone for gonadism. He usually administered the vaccine in his shoulders. He took the testosterone bi-weekly. On Monday he administered it his left shoulder and on Thursday it is in his right shoulder. After getting the vaccine he administered testosterone in his right shoulder on Thursday and had no issues. The patient mentioned everyone else who got the COVID Vaccine he knows had sore arm, nausea, but he did not have any of that. On Monday (17May2021) he injected his testosterone into the same arm/location, left arm, where he got the COVID vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction. He contacted his doctor and went to the emergency room. The patient confirmed he felt like he had recovered completely from the anaphylactic reaction. Caller clarified the anaphylactic reaction. He did the testosterone injection in the same spot he had the COVID injection. Within 5 minutes it was like his skin was on fire. He was sweating, had stomach cramps, and was throwing up. Once he stopped throwing up he looked at his arms and saw they were solid red. They were all inflamed. His legs were inflamed. His hands swelled up. They were red. He had to take his wedding ring off. He was itchy. It was like he was on fire. He was sore, and sore where injected the Testosterone into left arm.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

                                                Friday at 1:30 (3/5 my husband received the first shot. That evening he wasn&#39;t feeling well at all. Went to sleep in the morning on 3/6 he still was feeling horrible. Looked gray in color- thought he was getting the flu. At 2AM I woke to him having a seizure. Followed by another seizure at 10AM ( 3/7) followed by another seizure at 3PM (3/7) followed by another seizure at 3AM  (3/8) and another seizure at 6:30 AM on (3/8).

                                                Patient received dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine at a clinic. After the dose was administered the patient experienced tachycardia (pulse 110), elevated BP (measured with arm cuff at ~180/120), headache, and warmth. The patient was offered a cold pack, given water, and was taken away to a secluded room to relax under supervision. After about 1.5 hours the patient improved (BP 120/76 and pulse 85). The patient informed me that his rheumatologist recently had him stop his treatments for Crohn&#39;s disease in preparation to receive the vaccine. He stated that he had similar symptoms before when trying different treatment regimens for his underlying condition. The patient left on his own and no further adverse effects were reported.

I had Covid in March 2020 and the feeling was similar without the coughing and much shorter timeframe.  That continued until about 3am on Thursday March 18 when I thought I was almost back to normal.   When I woke up at 6am I thought I was ok but then I realized I had a lump under my left armpit on my side seemingly like my lymph node is swollen.  That continues as I write this at 341pm on Friday March 19.  I also developed hives on my right bicep and on my left and right buttocks and left and right hamstrings.  this is itchy.  I no longer have the soreness, sweating or fatigue but i have the swollen and what seems to be allergic reaction symptoms of hives.

                                                First dose, next morning.  Slight body aches low fever (below 100), lethargy and foggy headedness.  Arm hurt at injection site and pain spread slightly.  All symptoms seemed worse day 2 post shot  (3/17/2021).  Persisted for about 4 days, gradually getting better.  Went to work but was pretty miserable.  Took Tylenol and Ibuprofin alternating every 2 hours for fever.    Second dose next morning.  Higher fever (topped at about 101 and change), severe fatigue, slept 18 hrs and took off work. Alternated tylenol and ibuprofin every 2 hours.  Also chills, heavy night sweat body aches..  Next day, sub 100 fever that &#34;rollercoastered&#34; all day.  Alternated tylenol and ibuprofin every 2 hours. Body aches, arm ached at injection site. Worked from home.  Day 3 post injection (4/8/21) felt better, went to work, fine in the am, slight fatigue towards shift&#39;s end.

Injection site pain - feels like been punched in arm. Headache in the evening. Night chills and complained of &#34;tight&#34; (not acute) chest pain... but no breathing problems. Morning fever of 101F. Headache, Dizzy, Fatigue, Muscle Pain (esp in legs, asif he had &#34;run a marathon&#34;). He spent most of the day &#34;resting&#34;.  Evening on day two, we noticed a large bump under his vaccinated arm. Radius about 5cm - larger than what I know swollen lymph nodes to look like - almost looks like a bicep between his armpit and nipple. Tender to touch. Morning of day three (48 hours after vaccine) bump under his arm remains and all other symptoms seem milder.

These symptoms sound similar to shingles symptoms. For what it&#39;s worth, I have not received the shingles vaccine, I had chicken pox as a child.)

I looked in mirror and saw two pimple size type spots itchy. over the neck 30 mins another itchy pimple grew and neck got a bit red  and under an ear got red and itchy.   over the next hour my breathing felt a little more difficult, though oxygen level oximeter reading still good.  8.5 hours after vaccination both sides of my upper back/shoulders were covered in hives.  I felt a bit foggy also.  I administered epinephrine pen to my thigh.  Over next few minutes the hives disappeared (except for a few pimple size spots though they basically disappeared)and the itch was gone.   My breathing felt fine.  I monitored signs and symptoms with no noticeable issues for the next day&#43;.  This was the 1st time I ever used an epi pen.

After 20 minutes I was able to look in mirror after sitting in center for 15 minutes and the main itchy spot on my left neck/shoulder muscle had bubble like allergy look at main location of itchyness.  I also had some hives and redness about the diameter of 4 inches or so on the neck.   I reported the symptoms at the site to a nurse at the front table of the waiting room.  After about 25 minutes the itchness and redness kept subsiding.  After about one hour the itchyness was over and the bumps had completely disappeared.  I did not take any benadryl or epi pen.

About 36 hours after the shot, I discovered two very large hives/welts on my back that were very itchy and stung. I took my daily Allegra during the day and then a Benadryl at night. I also applied hydrocortisone cream on both. Today is April 14 and they are both feeling much better with treatment and seem to be going away.

Severe dizziness to the point I could not walk, headache and joints pains started around 10am while at work. I left work at 1:30pm  When I got home around 2:00pm, I felt tremendous amount of fatigue.  I slept from 2pm until 5:00pm.  I went back to bed at 6:30pm.  During the night I had cold chills and sweated all night until my sheets were drenched.  I slept until 9:30am.  I felt much better after taking a shower. I would not have the second dose!!

                                                Had soreness and tenderness at injection within one hour of vaccination. Approximately 13-15 hours after Vaccination, woke from sleep with fever and chills. Fever was 100 as measured using oral digital thermometer. Experienced mild body muscle aches and stiffness, especially in the upper back, shoulders and neck.  Had mild to moderate fatigue and persistent headache at base of skull. Also experienced muscle twitching within 2 hours of vaccination through the lower limbs and torso, with more activity concentrated in the legs and feet. Was not painful, but strange. Some of this muscle fluttering and twitching preceded muscle cramping in the feet. Frequency was almost continuous with short, 60 second pauses between twitches. The moved and we?re not in the same exact location. We?re especially active when when lying flat, relaxed in bed. All symptoms aside from the twitching subsided fully by the following Morning (April 15th 2021). Took body temp that morning and had returned to 98.7 f.  Muscle twitches have continued  five days beyond vaccination, although they have grown milder and less frequent.

At 3am on 04/10/2021 took 2 gel caplets of Advil hoping to do better.  The Advil brought the fever down to 100-101 for several hours but the fever went right back up.  Arm was sore and had headache.  My fever went down to 99 degrees 48 hours after taking the shot on 04/11/2021 at 3pm. Later on 04/11/2021 around 9pm my temperature went back to normal including any pain or swelling at the injection site.  I had to re-hydrate myself but felt better.  Overall I would do it again to protect my family from this virus.

I though it was shingles since I had ir before, I went to the doctor and he prescribed some mediction and a cream, I still have the circle and it still itches, looks better but today I am supposed to get the second Pfizer shot.

Symptoms tapered off over 3-5 days. Similar experience with 2nd vaccine but less pronounced with a shorter timeframe, tapering off after 2-3 days. Strongest side effects after first vaccine, symptoms did not become noticeable until a couple of hours after it was administered, increasing next 24 hours before lessening over time. Basically identical to long covid symptoms but lasting only for a few days after vaccinations and not before.

The rash was red in color, raised skin and was located near my right bicep, inside elbow area. This rash subsided for most part the day after. Also had the chills for over 48 hours, slight headaches on and off and was extremely tired with low energy. It felt like I was in a fog for a couple of days.

A 50-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE at the arm right (reported as right shoulder) for covid-19 immunisation (reported as he is trying to avoid serious illness). The patient medical history includes sleep from unknown date and if ongoing. Concomitant medication included zolpidem (reported as generic ambien) taken for sleep, start and stop date were not reported and added that he has been taking it for years but he hasn&#39;t taking it since he got the vaccine but thinks he took it the day before. The patient previously took bnt162b2 first dose on 10Mar2021 (roughly two weeks before the second dose) at the left shoulder for covid-19 immunisation. It was reported that the patient had no reaction to the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and he received the second dose on 31Mar2021. He explained following the second dose, his first issue was a &#34;headache&#34;, then he had &#34;real soreness&#34; in his arm where he got the injection. He added he developed a &#34;large lymph node under that arm&#34;, which he &#34;feels internally&#34;. He specified he still feels it a week later. He also explained he is &#34;unable to maintain an erection&#34;. He described himself as &#34;athletic&#34; and specified not having erectile problem in the past. He asked if his current symptoms have been reported as side effect to the vaccine. It was also added that after the second dose he appeared to have some issues with maintaining an erection on 04Apr2021. It was stated he is fairly active with a muscular build and could be a result after an exercise injury but this did happen after his second shot. Caller states he also had soreness in his arms and an enlarged lymph node under his arm that he could feel with his hand but that went away yesterday (from 01Apr2021 to 07Apr20210). The soreness was on both shoulders but he thinks the soreness on the other shoulder is from lifting weights and the shoulder from the injection site had pain, internal bone like pain (from 01Apr2021 to 07Apr20210). It was stated that the lymph node he could feel internally but didn&#39;t protrude through skin and went away yesterday and lasted 6-7 days. It was also reported that the soreness and lymph node went away yesterday and believes everything will get back to normal, he expected soreness to last a couple of days and it lasted a week. The patient stated he took some sleep medication after the second injection. He doesn&#39;t remember if it was the night before the injection. He took Ambien, a higher dosage. States maybe issues with maintaining an erection are beginning to improve. It was also stated the soreness and lymph node he noticed it the day after the injection, by the evening of 01Apr2021 and as of yesterday 07Apr2021 evening it feels like its completely back to normal. It was noted for the treatment that he didn&#39;t take anything but bought a gripper where he squeezes it and builds strength in his hands to give him some relief. The patient added that he&#39;s pretty active, he works out 4-5 days a week, including running. The outcome of the event some issues with maintaining an erection/ unable to maintain an erection was recovering; for the event headache was unknown, for all other events was recovered on 07Apr2021.  Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received the Pfizer vaccine on 21 December 2021.  On December 27 I developed a fever, cough and was diagnosed with Covid-19.  About 14 days later I started to get a rash on hands and feet with burning sensation.  I was evaluated and diagnosed with Covid toes.  About 1 week later I developed a fever and was evaluated and diagnosed with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and a DVT.  I continue to get worse to include arthritis in hands, wrists, feet and ankles.  I was admitted to the hospital with worsening pneumonia, reactive arthritis and a rash on elbows, knees, hands and feet.  I was in the hospital for about 5 days.  I have been evaluated by rheumatology, pulmonary and dermatology since.  The ongoing theory is I have a reactive arthritis from COVID and may have developed psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis.

                                                On April 1, 2021, I received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine at the Center and the only side effect from the vaccine at that time was localized soreness at the injection site of my left shoulder.   On April 2, 2021, earlier that day the soreness at the injection site began to dissipate after doing push-ups and massaging my left arm. After going to bed last night and that night is when the additional side effects started.  I was awakened by itching on both arms which had formed whelps from my shoulder to my forearm.   For the next 13 days, the whelps and itching were sparsely during the day (which had consumed my legs, upper torso as well as arms) as they presented the illusion to be getting better but would flare up at night while sleeping. I attempted to do home remedies from Calamine lotion, Benadryl and cold showers but nothing seemed to effectively work against the itching and the whelps that resembled Hives.    On April 13, 2021, while at work a new side affect began which was the swelling of my bottom lip (particularly the right half) along with itching in my throat.  The swelling reduced itself as I continued to work through the night but the discomfort in my throat continued. The whelps and itching were still sparsely present as well.   On April 14, 2021, later that morning, post work, the reduced swelling of my lower lip and throat discomfort I decided to go to the ER. While enroute to the ER, my top lip began to tingle and swell. These events made me more concerned about the severity I was experiencing since receiving the vaccine.   After checking into the ER and being triaged, the doctor informed me that I would be hospitalized overnight due to the swelling of my upper lip, elongated tonsils, elevated blood pressure and the diagnosis of whelps as Hives. For the next three nights I was intravenous administered Epinephrine, Benadryl and Prednisone.   On April 16, 2021, the third night I was discharged from the hospital with the same medications and informed to follow up with an allergist.

I had Pain at the Injection site on my Left arm a few hours after receiving the vaccine at 11:00 am on 6/5/21.  Initially I did not feel anything.  However the Pain got worse thruout the day until I went to bed at night.  The Injection site also was a little swollen after a few hours of getting the vaccine.  I had experienced some fatigue and tiredness on 6/5/21 after getting the vaccine.   When waking up in the morning on 6-6-21 I must of had fever at night because in the morning I was sweaty.  I also felt tired and fatigued when waking up.  The pain at the injection site seems to have gotten a little better.  Also there is no fever or sweating after i woke up.

It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever; Chills; Aches; joints ache; Some muscle pain; Headache; Tiredness; Injection side swelled up; feeling poorly; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable nurse (who is also the patient). A 51-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: 28Dec2020 (as reported)), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at single dose, as a preventive measure for Covid. Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure). Concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate and amlodipine besilate (NORVASC 5 mg) both for blood pressure. The patient reported, &#34;I received my first dose of Covid19 vaccine on Monday (28Dec2020) and it is now Friday and I am still sick and I am wondering how long these symptoms typically take to get better from because it seems like it is day 5 now so&#34;. When probed for events the patient stated, &#34;Everything on the list, fever, chills, aches, my joints ache, some muscle pain, headache, tiredness, injection side swelled up. I was not nauseas or anything like that. I still have fever today. I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7. It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever.&#34; The patient mentioned, &#34;I kind of like started feeling poorly on the 29th (29Dec2020) late at night but on the 30th (30Dec2020) I had fever and everything.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: is always good on an unspecified date, body temperature: 101.7 on 30Dec2020, body temperature: 99 on 01Jan2021 (reported as &#34;I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7. It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever&#34;), and laboratory test: unknown results on Dec2020 (reported as &#34;I did go for full series of stuff, checkup but that was more than 2 weeks ago&#34;). The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

                                                Injection site pain started a few hours after 1st dose COVID vaccine and hasn&#39;t fully resolved five weeks later. Range of motion is fine. Second dose was given slightly lower and with deltoid pulled out slightly by the vaccinator and wasn&#39;t painful. I saw my sports medicine doc yesterday (2/12/21) for routine follow-up to a right rotator cuff tear and had her examine my left shoulder as well. She says her exam of the L shoulder is consistent with bursitis and the history and exam suggest the 1st dose of the COVID vaccine was a bit too deep and at least some of the vaccine got into the bursa. I&#39;m a physician working in public health with occupational exposures to COVID, so I&#39;m concerned whether or not the vaccine will be effective if the first dose was injected deep to the deltoid.

He had pain and swelling along with an infection in his teeth and ears, cough and fever.  No appetite, no smell, some chills, body aches and headaches.  This past Saturday the 13th he said that he was having bad headaches and fatigue.  He did also say that he was having vomiting but that had been after taking his antibiotic and medications for the shingles, basically his right side of his body.

Pain began subside over coming weeks and was nearly resolved by 1/22/21 when employee was seen for 2nd vaccine which was given in rt deltoid. EE reported that he had elbow pain but that it was nearly gone at time that he received 2nd dose. 48 hrs post 2nd vaccine EE began to experience sharp severe pain at same lt elbow and pain is still persisting currently. It is interfering with his ability to lift and his grip strength on the left at this time due to severity of pain. He agrees to be evaluated.

With second dose given on 02/27/2021 there was only mild soreness at the injection site until the morning of 02/28/2021. At this time I started to experience fatigue and malaise. This gradually worsened throughout the day although no additional symptoms developed until the following day.  When I awoke at around 7:00 am on the morning of 03/01/2021 the feeling of fatigue and malaise were gone however, I noticed significant swelling with minor discomfort in my left armpit area. At 8:00 pm on the same day only mild swelling persists, without discomfort.

I hit my head on a chair when I was falling and cut my head. I stayed laying down because I was still dizzy and hot. They called the squad and did vitals and I was fine. I sat there for about another half an hour and I went home. I have felt fine ever since. Only thing that hurt was my head from the fall.

Headache lasted until I went to bed that night took Tylenol throughout the day with occasional mild help but not much. Took my temperature it was 98.8 I usually run around 96/97  It got up to 98.8 later that morning. As the day progressed my muscles ached and I had very little  energy.  I napped a little but otherwise was just planted on the couch.   The headache was the most annoying and steady.   All symptoms were gone when I woke the next morning.  My temp today is 97.7 and that?s a little higher than normal and my head still feels a little warm when  someone else feels it and I feel still a tad warmer than normal.   Otherwise I feel pretty good.

                                                Arm pain within 24 hours. However, the arm pain in my left should really start hurting on the ninth or tenth day after the 2nd dose.  By the time I made it to urgent care, I was in serious pain to the point I had to raise both of my arms to help tolerate the pain.  After the EKG was done to comfirm I wasn&#39;t having a heart attack, the Nurse Practitioner ordered a pain relief injection in my right hip and a prescription of ibuprofen 800 mg along with ice compression on my left arm where I received the 2nd dose.

                                                Shortly after receiving the injection my arm went ice cold all the way to my fingers and warmed up again quickly. On the way home (about an hour later) I noticed numbness and tingling in my hand and that has continued since (11 days as of this report). My upper arm muscle was sore later that evening and by the next day the pain in my upper arm was extreme. I couldn&#39;t move my arm without extreme pain. I took some tylenol late in the day and that did help cut down on some of the pain. I also put an ice pack on my upper arm but it didn&#39;t help. The pain wasn&#39;t as bad the next (3rd) day but it&#39;s still significant enough for me to restrict activity with it. There is also a burning sensation off and on as well as itching deep in my arm. My upper arm has also felt like there is a tight band around it (since day 2) although the muscles themselves don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s any tightness or knots. I took ibuprofen on day 10 and it helped a little but not a whole lot. At this point I also have what feels like swelling or tenderness under my arm near the armpit area. The pain, burning and itching in my upper arm continues as well as the numbness, tingling and pins all up and down my arm to my hand and fingers.

Over the following hours, the rash covered the entire underside of both forearms, from elbow to wrist; rash also extended from armpits down the side of the ribcage on both sides. Some rash also appeared across the ribcage and on the back, at the base of the spine down to the sacrailiac. Currently nearing 72 hours after injection.  I also experienced considerable chills and muscle/joint aches, which has improved, but which has not yet disappeared.

This was mainly just a nuisance like mild poison ivy.  The next day (today) it is not as red but it is still itchy.  I do not know if the vaccine caused this, but thought that I should report it.  It seems like not a big deal at all.  I am very thankful for the vaccine.

Hives with itch appeared about 3 hours after the shot was given, along with an itchy feeling in mouth and on tongue and feeling of strangeness in throat. I felt mostly normal during the 30 minutes after the shot, but developed a headache, chills, mildly upset stomach. I have anxiety issues and was nervous about getting shot so was hesitant to label anything as a side effect as it could be anxiety/panic disorder etc. But the rash/hives are itchy - I showered which made them itchier. I&#39;m submitting this @ 10:30pm EST, my shot was @ 2pm EST - I have taken more zyrtec worried I am having an allergic reaction. I am filing this because I am worried about the 2nd shot - I do not want to have  a worse allergic reaction after the 2nd shot. I will call my allergist. He manages my allergies and advised me to continue taking my seasonal allergy meds and zyrtec as normal during the shot today. Presently there are no hives/itch on any other parts of my body except my upper chest and upper back.

                                                I got the vaccine on Tuesday morning. On Thursday morning when I woke up, the skin around my left eye was red (like in a rash) and the eye was swollen. By Friday morning, my other eye was swollen as well and I developed a rash on my upper right chest (very close to the collar bone). By Saturday morning, my symptoms had worsened slightly. I went to urgent care to see a doctor at 1 PM. They were not sure if this was a reaction to the vaccine. They asked me if I had exposure to poison oak, I didn&#39;t (although I do have severe allergy to poison oak). They recommended taking Allegra 180mg twice a day. Doctor recommended taking the second dose of the vaccine per plan on 4/20 but starting Allegra 1 day before that and continue to take it until 3 days later. I have occasional itching but no pain.

The next day I did a televisit through my health insurance provider&#39;s website and saw a medical professional who advise that I treat the hives with OTC drugs like Benedryl &amp; Pepcid.  I also used topical creams like Cortisone &amp; Gold Bond.  I soaked in a bath with an oatmeal powder.  Also used an ice pack.  I got very little temporary relief from these treatments.  The medical profession said to not use a steroid as no one is sure what that could do to the effectiveness of the vaccine.  This has gone on now for over three full days now and I&#39;m following up with my regular medical practice today.  The affected areas (most of my body) look slightly better today but I&#39;m still just as itchy.  In addition, my top lip was slightly swollen when I woke up today but has since gone down.  I haven&#39;t had any respiratory issues.

I got up to go to the bathroom. I started getting the chills and feeling dizzy. I passed out. My wife found me  passed out on the ground and bleeding. I needed six stitches in my head and have a black eye as well as other facial lacerations. I have no recollection of anything until my wife woke me.  I have never passed out in my life prior to this.

On the morning of the 3rd day after (April 17), noticed the rash was not on the inner thigh as well as on both sides of my torso just below the armpit.  The rash is presenting as small, raised bumps that can be itchy if disturbed.  Some look as if they could be small blisters, but there is no drainage of any kind.

Also noticed the day after both shots I was highly sensitive to the sun  and my forehead got discolored blotchy red/brown (similar to a bad sunburn but without the pain) that took a day to mostly go away, but still has hints of it.   Cold sore is subsiding but expect it to last at least a week. Haven?t had them in a long time, but recognize it.

Also my mood is significantly altered as I am suffering from anxiety and a short temper.

                                                I have sever lower back problems from time to time and  the first vaccine, in March, triggered severe spasms and fatigue which I reported. The second shot triggered a reaction similar to being stung by a wasp, I am allergic to wasps and carry an epipin; however, I broke out in a red rash all over my body and remained very red Saturday and Sunday and now months later, I have unexplained rashes which  pop up on my arms from time to time. Thankfully, they go away within a day or so,  but the rashes are annoying, especially bc they seem to be spontaneous.  Also, when I got the second shot, it felt like someone was grabbing my heart from time to time on the morning of my shot. Sorry for only reporting this now.

                                                Patient spoke to me this morning regarding some symptoms he had after his Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination yesterday.  He said he had some pain at the injection site and mild headache in the afternoon; however, around 12 to 1 am in the morning, he was feeling heart palpitation and he felt his muscle twitching from his upper torso which went down to his thigh and no loss of consciousness.  He said he checked his heart rate and it was 70 and he did not have any problems breathing.  He said his heart palpitation felt better after taking some deep breaths.  He said he no longer had heart palpitations or muscle twitching any more.  He denied any other symptoms.   Generally, he appeared well, no facial drooping, awake, alert, oriented, speech clear, and normal gait. (Today)

My fever was 102.8 when I first woke up. I was very nauseous and my fever felt worse. My thermometer would not read any more until my temp came down. I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

                                                Two weeks after the first vaccine I broke out in hives. It started as an itch in my foot and my ankles. It worked its way up my legs and then to my flank. I took a course of Prednisone but after I finished the course the hives came back. I had gotten it under control with Zyrtec and Benadryl and then switched to Allegra. I had just gotten it under control when I got the second dose and the hives started again exactly two weeks after that dose. The hives started again, and I am still getting them after 12 weeks and I cant get them under control. They are moving around my body in patches up and down my body from top to bottom and then back to top. The worst is when it is on my torso. They are red and inflamed spots that are raised and itchy. Everyday it is in a different place. I have taken three courses of Prednisone. In the last few days, they have become more dispersed around my body. I even have them in the palms of my hands, the bottom of my feet and on my ears and the top of my head. I have never had any allergies before. I got both vaccines in the left arm. Currently, I am still taking Allegra twice a day plus a prescription at night. I have consulted with a dermatologist, an Allergist and my Primary Care Physician.

                                                I work 3rd shift Started with chills about 11pm same day as shot, then by 3am my heart rate dropped to 48 bpm and extreme shivering.  (My normal resting rate is about 80 bpm). Heart rate came back up shortly but still below my normal bpm. When I got home at 7am was very weak and chilled, and on both hands my fingers turned completely white like they wasn?t getting circulation and were very cold.. I went to bed feeling horrible hoping it wasn?t serious and after I slept more than normal, I feel good now.  Can?t say my heart rate going that low wasn?t kinda scary.

                                                I received my second COVID vaccination in the afternoon and started to experience side effects from the shot around 1:00 in the morning.  When I woke up to go to the bathroom at 4:30 in the morning I was not feeling well in my stomach and I felt a little dizzy.  On my way back to bed from the bathroom I fainted and fell face first into the wall heater and then to to the floor.  This action fractured my nose and gave me multiple bruises and cuts in my face and upper body.

All over body shaking.  Not unlike &#34;chills&#34; but didn&#39;t have the cold feeling with it.  No accompanying fever at the time.  Lasted until 5:30am.   6am - 15 hours after vaccine . Shortly after the shaking stopped, spiked a 101.5 degree fever.  That continued until approximately 5am the following day.  Took 500mg acetaminophen at 7am, and again at 4pm, and again at 12am.  Throughout the following day - 15 hours to 36 hours after vaccine - general body aches (most noticeable in the back), lethargic - but that could have been a result of no sleep the night prior due to shaking.   5pm following day - 27 hours after vaccine - bad headache.  That lasted until midnight 5am the next morning - most all side effects gone.  Some lethargy but temperature at 98.6 degrees, body aches no longer apparent, headache gone.

                                                muscles tight; shingles; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 52-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 52-years-old), administered in Arm Right on 12Apr2021 13:45 (Lot Number: ER8731; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included psoriatic arthritis (diagnosed with this for a few years, like maybe 6 or 7 years), cholesterol. Concomitant medications included pravastatin and ezetimibe, both taken for cholesterol and from unspecified start dates and ongoing. The patient experienced shingles on 17Apr2021, muscles tight on an unspecified date. He received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine on 12Apr2021. Then on 17Apr2021, he developed a red spot on his shoulder (on left shoulder, It was a red spot with bubbles filled with fluid), cold chills, and a &#34;funny feeling&#34; or pain on his left hand or arm (&#34;Then, he went and got worse. Then, he had chills and no fever but he had cold chills&#34;). He added that Saturday morning, he was not feeling right. Then added that it was like Friday he had a cold or something. He adds that he does not get high fevers so he thought he had like allergies but it was not so, and he had cold spells. He did not have a fever. The skin on his left hand felt funny when he was touching it, it was almost painful. Like, when someone touches their hand it feels okay but this almost felt painful to touch. It was his left hand. It was his left shoulder almost close to his neck where the red spot was. Saturday, he saw the spot and felt symptoms. He thought maybe he touched something, or something bit him. Sunday, the symptoms did not go away. He started feeling worse, feeling sick but not a fever. He said it persisted until Sunday. By Monday morning, because his wife is a daycare director, he told her he got sicker and not to go because he felt sick and he did not know if he had COVID or he did not know what he had. They went to the clinic to make sure it was not COVID. He got tested for COVID, but also told them he discovered the red spot and he had symptoms. They tested him for COVID and it was negative. The doctor looked at the red spot and saw his symptoms and said that patient has shingles. He then was diagnosed with shingles and was given medication for it. The doctor told him all the signs were matching with shingles. Patient asked the doctor if this is related to the vaccine and the doctor said honestly she does not know if it is related. He was given a drug for 7 days, Valacyclovir. Treatment: Valacyclovir 1000 MG 3 times a day for 7 days. He started this medication on Monday. He has also taken Advil. The doctor told him to take Advil. He usually takes it in the morning, and then if he starts to need it because shingles can make people feel cold and flulike symptoms from the shingles. It goes away but it is not consistent. He takes it whenever he does not feel well. The headache is because of the spot the infection is, close to his neck. It gets muscles tight and that creates pressure. It is hard for him to lay down and sleep because of the shingles. He wanted to know if this is a normal reaction with the vaccine and if he should still receive the 2nd dose, and what he should do next. Currently, symptoms &#34;Skin on left hand felt funny&#34; comes and goes, &#34;cold chills&#34; got better but did not go away completely. All the symptoms, like usually he will take Advil, and they will go away. He adds that the chills will go away and get better as the days progress with medications. He did not have a cough. The headaches were intense. The red spot on shoulder, the dot is on his left side of his chest and it moves around, now it is bigger on his chest. The shingles expanded and went to his chest, too. Shingles are painful and no fun. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test: negative on 19Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 52-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0173 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 08May2021 at 02:38 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included Bug bite (happened 5 days prior to 30Apr2021 and regimen of an antibiotic). He was completely done with the rotation for a least 8 days before he got the vaccine. It might have something to do with this. concomitant medication included dicloxacillin (started it on 30Apr2021 and it was for 5 days. He did not know what it did was). The patient reported that on 08May2021, day one, he experienced, tiredness and injection site pain. On day 2, until now side effects which had not gone away. It hadn&#39;t gotten worse, but it was not any better. The patient felt like congestion, but his nose was bone dry, like crusty dry. It hurts a little bit because it was so dry and he had arm soreness, nothing out of the ordinary. The arm soreness was just normal injection stuff. At first it was a little tender on the injection spot. It went away after about a day. On 10May2021, the patient felt like there were little, tiny baby hands pinching his internal organs randomly throughout his abdomen. It was not a sharp pain, more like a little squeeze all through his abdomen. It felt like his whole throat was swollen. It was not visually swollen, it more felt like a football in his neck. Stretching it was helping. His toes have been locking up like a pre-clamping. He had numbness from his ankles to his feet for 8 days, and now he has numbness from his knees to his feet. It was not completely numb, but it was not normal. The feeling of baby hands pinching his internal organs started the second day after the vaccine and has stayed consistent. The patient&#39;s eyes swollen, and his vision was diminished. Day 2 through today, it felt like his eyes were swollen, his vision was seriously diminished, he had a golf ball sized welt on his arm not at the injection site but 2 inches from it, and he was really dizzy and really lightheaded and almost fainted at the corner store. The feeling like his eyes were swollen started on day 3 after the vaccine. The crease of his eye be-low the eyebrow and on top of the socket got red and puffy and looked like sunburnt skin does. It was at the point that now it feels swollen all the time almost like he had pink eye and his vision has been diminished about 30%. He had a test done yesterday and his vision was 20/25. Some-times he could not even read a text and had to stare at his phone for 10 minutes to make out words. He did not have these issues before. The feeling of his eyes being swollen was a little better in the mornings and about 1300 it gets worse when he gets lightheaded to where was when it started. His vision became diminished about day 3 after the vaccine. It was a little better in the morning, but in the afternoon, it goes to exactly the same as when it started. He noticed the golf ball sized welt on his arm about 3 days ago. The doctor seemed to think a drop of the injection might had travelled from the injection site and his body was creating a defense to it. It was scary to take a shower and then see that. It didn&#39;t hurt. It was not painful, but it was a weird foreign entity. The cramping in his toes started probably day 3 and was consistent. The numbness started on day 2 after the vaccine, and up until 3 days ago it was just his ankles and feet. 3 days ago, it got to the point where it was from his knees to his feet. It has gotten worse since it was now travelling up his legs. On his injection arm- 2 inches away from the injection site appeared a size of a gigantic golf ball - when asked with his doctor he said that he thinks that a drop of the vaccine travelled and his body building a reaction to it and it was very abnormal. The patient also had numbness from his ankle to his feet worsened and from his knees to his feet- almost feels like it was cold and tingly. The patient also had dizziness and lightheaded about day 2 after the vaccine and it was the same. It came in waves but was consistent throughout the day. He would be fine then had a wave of dizziness. He has been laying down so much because he was so tired, ringing ears, felt like his glands were swollen, pressure in his neck to his injection site, and back pains. The patient stated that his doctor was only form urgent care. The patient Felt like whole throat was swollen, toes locking up, really lightheaded, mind has been foggy, and arm soreness. The patient had bizarre side effects from the Covid Vaccine for 11 days now. He thought it was the smart thing to report them to Pfizer. He didn&#39;t like to give personal information. He declined to give his mailing address or his email address. He hated when asked for race, but he guessed it might be important. He did not have a mailing address, phone number, or email address handy for his physician. He went to Urgent Care yesterday to have it checked and they did an EKG and said he had to be sent by ambulance to the ER. The doctor did bloodwork, and she said everything looked alright and to rest a few more days and keep hydrated. The patient underwent the lab work and procedures which included chest X-ray with unspecified result. He thinks it was on 18May2021. His mind has been foggy with all of that. It was yesterday or the day before. He could not be sure. He has been sleeping so much and was in a complete daze. The fogginess he had the whole time as his other symptoms, and it was the same. He has been eating well and hydrating and taking a multivitamin and Gatorade, all the things&#39; people say to do. He asked if Pfizer has heard of this before. He was panicked it might be chronic, and he worries about the safety of the second shot for him. He was sure many people haven&#39;t reacted, but these are freaky side effects. He asked for advice and if Pfizer had heard of this before or if he was some weird anomaly. On his way to get the vaccine he asked 2 people at the city health line if they had taken it and they both said no. He asked 3 other patients and they said they took the Pfizer. One woman said she will take it when they make her. The guy who gave him the shot lied and said he wasn&#39;t eligible. It might have been his way of not having to discuss it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior vaccination. The patient was tested for Covid post vaccination with Nasal Swab on 18May2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Device Date: 23May2021,Additional information has been requested.

A 52-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 23Apr2021 (lot number: EN0170), as 2nd dose, single dose, at age 52 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), administered in the left arm, on 24Mar2021 (lot number: EP6955), at age 52 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within four weeks of BNT162B2. On 23Apr2021, the patient received his second dose of BNT162B2. On 23Apr2021 at 19:30, the patient experienced injection pain/injection site extreme pain. The patient did not act on it because he knew the injection site may be sore for a week. On 24Apr2021, the injection site was hurting bad but again he did not act on it because he knew it may sore but it had been a whole month and it was concerning. The reporter stated that the pain was causing the patient&#39;s blood pressure to be elevated. The reporter noticed the blood pressure elevation about 2 weeks after the second injection in the morning time (May2021). The patient also experienced headache at the same time as when the patient&#39;s blood pressure was elevated around the morning time, about 2 weeks after the second injection (May2021). It was reported that the pain was so bad that the patient could not sleep at night within a week of the second injection (Apr2021), time of onset was reported as &#34;around 15:00 or 16:00 and as it goes over to the night 190:0 or 20:00, sometimes he is not going to sleep until 02:00 the next morning&#34;). The events required physician&#39;s office visit on an unspecified date (reported as &#34;the other day&#34;) and the reporter brought the events to the doctor&#39;s attention and stated that the patient was in pain throughout the day. The reporter was thinking of taking the patient to urgent care. Treatment for the event &#34;injection pain/injection site extreme pain&#34; and &#34;pain&#34; included heating pads, ice packs, lidocaine patches, unspecified cream and rubbing lotion to try and ease the pain. The reporter was thinking about Advil and asked every how many hours should the patient take the Advil. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

                                                Right after vaccine administered, I noticed that the injection site seemed a bit high and more in my shoulder than my upper arm. Did not think  much more of it until pain started about four hours later then at 0130 in the morning awoke with much throbbing in arm such that I took 600mg ibuprofen in order to sleep.  The site remains very tender to touch not warm or red and the injection site is just under my left acromion process shoulder area.  I work in the ED and must use this arm for airway management procedures.  Fortunately I am off clinical duties until Tuesday, Jan. 19, so hopefully pain will subside by then, but I do not think I could intubate anyone in my current state.  I do not think this is a reaction to the vaccine per se but  more so a result of the site of injection in my tendon/bursa area of my shoulder. At this time, I cannot move my left shoulder without pain.  I am trying to perform ROM exercises to hopefully reduce the time of discomfort overall. I also have some vague sense of radiation down my forearm into my left pinky finger ulnar distribution.

I had a dripping sweat occur at the five to fifteen minute range. There was a flushing sensation during this. After a few minutes, it all abaited. The bandaid was saturated with blood.  My arm was never sore and I had zero symptoms after the initial reaction. I believe this injection was given intravascularly.  I have not been able to find ANY information to address the effectiveness of this route if administration and I seriously fear that I am not covered.

                                                I ate nothing that morning of the shot. The first day:  I took the covid-19 vaccine Pfizer shot on Thursday the 4th of March; there was pain at the injection site just as any other vaccine I have been administered during military service.  After the shot I felt tied, and my left arm did hurt from the shot, I started to feel irritable (angry or even aggressive), my chest became tight and my heart rhyme felt somewhat off causing me to start coughing and sometimes uncontrollable to the point I could not catch my breath I thought about seeking medical attention but did not..  The second day:  Pain in my left arm went away at the injection site, tiredness went away, and the feeling of irritable (angry or even aggressiveness) went away, tightness in my chest and coughing went away. I have been having a chronic pain in my left arm for about a year and after the shot the pain was gone I noticed that on the second day. I did notice my body temperature was up and down showing symptoms of histamine reaction but not out of control.

The next night after eating Tuna I had the tongue swelling again with some Tachycardia and a severe headache with red welts all over my body. I also had tightness in my throat. I went to the Urgent Care where they gave me Antihistamine, Prednisone, something for headache and IV Fluids.  I was discharged after three hours and felt better within a few hours. I took Prednisone for five days.

                                                I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 3/16 and did not feel any adverse effects until one week later. On 3/23 I started feeling a few twinges on my left side where my bra strap is normally, and then on 3/25 I noticed a rash in that same area. I thought it might be a reaction from the vaccine since it was on the same side as the injection site. But within a few days it was noticeably worse and painful. I went to urgent care on 3/27 and was diagnosed with shingles. I am now on antiviral medication and prednisone.

By 9pm Thursday my entire body ached severely as if I had a very bad flu. By 11pm I had very severe cold &amp; hot shakes and felt extremely nauseous until the next morning. I checked my temp every couple hours and never was I above 98.5 but, I felt extremely sick until about 48 hours after the 2nd shot. On Friday, and for the next 2-3 days, I felt fatigued as if I was recovering from the flu. Only a flu that was without fever or any respiratory issues.  By Monday I felt normal again.

                                                Last night, I was doing dishes and felt a brief, sharp pain at the injection site.  Immediately afterwards, I got a tingling sensation that went from my left cheek to elbow.  It lasted a bit but wasn&#39;t very bad , considering some of the side effects I had heard of.  Then, on April 2nd, I found that touching the injection site caused the same reaction, albeit not as bad.  This occurred twice today.  When I looked the symptoms up on the web, I didn&#39;t find any mention of this.  However, Google seems to have seen something because before I could get the entire search term in, it completed for arm tingling.  At this point, I decided to report it.  Again, the reaction is very mild, but very odd.

                                                Immediately after the shot , I felt arm get strangely itchy , then my left arm was very warm for a couple hours.  I told the Dr there , they released me after 20 min , as there was no serious pain . After couple of days with Sore Arm pain , my left ribs area became a little sore and starting to have what felt like nerve jolts from left side of my Neck down my left arm.   The Neck pain and nerve feeling got steadily worse over the next 3-4 days , on the 5th or 6th day the pain was so bad I could not move out of bed in the morning for over 2.5 hours.   With a sudden move there was lightening bolt type pain shooting down left arm and right leg.  Pain subsided over the next 3-4 days.  I would say now it&#39;s 90% .

                                                After my second dose, I have developed allergic reaction to peanuts.  I ate Pad Thai which contained peanuts few days after my second dose and developed itch all over my body.  I take Allegra for seasonal allergies, so I took it and the itch went away.  Today I ate Protein Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bars and again developed severe itch all over my body.  I have eaten Pad Thai and the cereal bars many times before the vaccine and never had any issue.

A 53-years-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration in the left shoulder on 13Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6207), at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergy. Concomitant medications included vitamin C (ascorbic acid); vitamin D (unknown manufacturer); fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for hypersensitivity, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced rash and skin irritation on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered. It was reported that about a week after his first shot, the patient got a rash in his armpit it&#39;s kind of magenta, look little creepy in the center section of it. It&#39;s on the arm that he had the shot on. So, it was not terribly irritating, it was a little irritating but did not really itch. The patient guess he got the reaction to it. The patient was scheduled to receive the second dose on 10Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Very little itching, minor swelling and redness, especially in areas of tight fitting clothing, started early in the morning on April 21, 2021. Took an extra 5 mg Xyzal tablet in the morning and rash disappeared in an hour. Rash returned in the evening, so took my usual nighttime dose of 5 mg Xyzal  in the evening and it again disappeared in an hour. Rash retuned the morning of 4/22/2021, similar to the night before. Again, took Xyzal and it disappeared in an hour. Evening of 4/22/2021 the rash did not reappear. Still took evening dose of Xyzal, as usual. This morning, 4/23/2021, no rash present. Took a morning dose of 5 mg Xyzal to be sure.   A similar rash has occurred before...see below.

He said that it itched and ached and then spread to his lower back. It hurt enough that he went to the ER and they ruled it down to the shot as the cause by eliminating other causes. The part that had spread to his back has healed but he still has the rash on his thigh on 4/25 (almost a month later),

A 53 years old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot ER2613, expiry date Jul2021) on 05Apr2021 at around 16:00, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given within 4 weeks. Medical history included cold sores. Concomitant medication included valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX) 1 g, 2 tablets when felt cold sore coming on, for cold sores. The patient took Valtrex just once in a while when he got cold sores, since probably 7-8 years ago. On 05Apr2021 at around 19:00 patient ankles started itching like he had mosquito bites. Hives started on the patient&#39;s ankles on 05Apr2021, then spread a little on his hands and a little on his trunk. Throughout the night of 05Apr2021, hives started appearing on his trunk, his stomach a little bit and some on his back. Over the course of 06Apr2021 to 07Apr2021, the hives spread to the patient&#39;s front, back, hands and feet. The patient worked most of 06Apr2021 and 07Apr2021 and the hives and the itching continued to get worse. The patient had more hives on 06Apr2021 and on 07Apr2021 he had hives all over. The patient&#39;s whole body was filled with hives. By 07Apr2021 night, the patient&#39;s itching was out of control and he couldn&#39;t hardly stand it. The events required physician office visit (urgent care for hives on 07Apr2021) and also emergency room during the night of 07Apr2021 and again on 08Apr2021 morning at 06:00. Caller reported that she and the patient just got back from the emergency room. The patient was starting to itch again. He lasted about 4 hours after getting home last night, 07Apr2021, and then went back to emergency room on 08Apr2021 morning. Nothing had really helped the patient&#39;s itching and hives. The medications took a little of the edge off of the patient&#39;s itching. They gave the patient an IV at the emergency room visit on 08Apr2021, but he was starting to itch again. The patient received a prescription for prednisone from urgent care (he had to take 60 mg  the first day, 60 mg the second day, and then taper down over 6 days). When the patient finally got the prescription for prednisone filled and the patient was finally able to take the prednisone, he was going crazy from the extreme itching. The patient hadn&#39;t eaten and ended up getting sick from the prednisone. First emergency room visit: the patient received a shot of diphenhydramine 50 mg at 11:33 PM and methylprednisolone sodium 125 mg at 11:36 PM on 07Apr2021. The emergency room gave the patient a prescription for doxepin 10 mg every night for 7 days to help the patient relax and so that he could sleep, but they were unable to have the prescription filled last night as the pharmacy was closed. The patient was given a dose of 10 mg of doxepin to go home with so that he could sleep. Second emergency room visit: the patient received diphenhydramine 50 mg injection at 7:54 AM, 20 mg of famotidine at 7:21 AM, 60 mg methylprednisolone at 7:19 AM, and a 500 mL bolus of sodium chloride 0.9% at 7:56 AM on 08Apr2021. The patient was sent home with prescriptions for hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg, 1 capsule by mouth three times daily as needed for up to 5 days and famotidine 20 mg, 1 tablet by mouth twice daily for 5 days. Hydroxyzine, famotidine, diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone and doxepin had not really helped the patient&#39;s hives and itching. The patient was still trying to recover at the time of report.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 53-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left (left shoulder) on 30Mar2021 09:00 (Lot Number: ER8733) at age of 53 years old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Family medical history relevant to events: caller states he don&#39;t think so, his father had high blood pressure and diabetes. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen taken for tooth disorder at 600 mg every 8-12 hours, taking it probably a week before receiving the vaccine. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No events following prior vaccinations. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient experienced slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at on 30Mar2021, chills on 02Apr2021, fever on 02Apr2021, sweating on 02Apr2021, continued muscle pain on 03Apr2021, skin, hair was hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin on 03Apr2021, muscular pain down to pelvis and knees aching on 03Apr2021, diarrhea on 03Apr2021, fatigue in 2021, headache in 2021, weakness and dizziness in 2021, sinus drainage in 2021, feels dehydrated in 2021.  The patient was calling to report some long term, severe side effects. He received the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He didn&#39;t have anything then muscle pain for the first two and a half days, no reaction until on Friday 02Apr2021 he had extreme chills, fever, sweating, then that continued on to be muscle pain, his skin and hair were hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin through Sunday 04Apr2021. It dissipated into muscular and inner-skeletal pain. He had muscular pain down to pelvis and knees and things would start aching.  Now it was kind of letting up. It was the 4th day now and no one he knows who had gotten it had such a long term reaction to this. Clarified that he had slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at and that dissipated on Thursday 01Apr2021 and he had no pain anymore and no other side effects. On Friday 02Apr2021 afternoon when it went haywire and thought he may have to go to the hospital on Sunday 04Apr2021. He had diarrhea and almost had everything on the list except redness at the site injection. He also did not have swollen lymph nodes. He didn&#39;t think he needed to go to the hospital, he normally didn&#39;t get sick and hadn&#39;t been ill for years and this was why he wanted to report it because it seemed that it was pulling for along time. He had been sleeping and drinking a lot of liquids. Headache, joint pain, and diarrhea continued all the way through Monday 05Apr2021 and started to dissipate Monday evening. He had no nausea and vomiting. The muscular pain down to pelvis started Saturday 03Apr2021. His knee would ache and then that would stop and then his other knee would ache then stop. It was like it would transfer around lower part of body, and that dissipated late Monday 05Apr2021 night into Tuesday (06Apr2021). Now he had fatigue was tired and had sinus drainage. He felt dehydrated and couldn&#39;t seem to drink enough liquids to get the feeling of dry mouth out.  The diarrhea, fatigue and the sinus drainage was still continuing and the other symptoms seem to have dissipated. He still felt so fatigued and didn&#39;t feel the other symptoms are there. He hoped they didn&#39;t return. It had stayed the same for the diarrhea, fatigue and sinus drainage and he was still tired. Later added he did have weakness and dizziness, but assumed it was fever and chills. Caller states he did have weakness and dizziness and Saturday 03Apr2021 and Sunday 04Apr2021 were the worst two for all of the symptoms at the same time. It had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021 evening. Outcome of weakness and dizziness: Caller initially confirmed it had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021. However, he later stated he was still experiencing slightness there. He still feels some weakness, and feels about 60% right now.  He thought it would be a good idea to get vaccinated because he had family members that had contracted covid-19 and be less weary of the virus. He was hesitant now to get the second shot. He was taking ibuprofen because he had issues with a tooth. He was taking Benadryl for the sinus and hadn&#39;t taken it in 36 hours and hadn&#39;t taking anything else. He was already taking Ibuprofen for the tooth issue, but was also using it to relieve some of the symptoms and if it was indeed that he may have contracted something after that. He hadn&#39;t been to the doctor but for checks ups in years and years.  Time of Onset (24-hour clock): Caller stated it started about 1-2 pm in the afternoon on Friday 02Apr2021 and came on very quickly. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of diarrhea, fatigue, sinus drainage was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 53-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 53-year-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Apr2021 11:15 (Lot Number: EW0153) at 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. The patient received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included famotidine (PEPCID AC).  The patient previously took flu shot in Oct2020, prilosec [omeprazole magnesium] for seasonal allergy and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced unexpected bruising near injection site. Bruise was the size of the bandaid, approximately 1&#34; x 2&#34;. Bruising had persisted for more than a week now. The patient had never experienced bruising like this with other vaccines. He would like to rule out possible thrombosis reaction before second shot. He did not have bruising at any other locations other than the injection site.  Bruise was purple and red splotches and has now progressed to mostly yellow. He believed the discoloration was a reaction to the vaccine and not the result of the needle. The shot itself was painful but patient felt minimal pain/stiffness following the shot. The event start date was on 20Apr2021. No treatment was received. The outcome was unknown.

                                                About 7 hours after my shot I experienced tingling and radiating pain down my left arm from my shoulder to wrist.   In the two weeks since my shot my symptoms are getting worse, not better.   I used to be able to do two sets of 50 push-ups and I can no longer do one push up.   I used to be able multiple sets of 15-20 pull ups for a total of 50 in a couple of minutes.  I can no longer do one.    I enjoy golf and  can no longer play .

On the first dose I got these Symptoms at 11:30pm then they subsided by 6:30 am with multiple doses of Tylenol.  I was able to return to work the next day.  The second night the symptoms returned around 11:00 and persisted until morning.  They went away with more Tylenol and all but the injection site pain did not return. On the second dose I had the same symptoms The same night as injection.  They did not go away with Tylenol, and continued through the entire next day.  Fever never broke.  Unable to go to work with fever over 100.  All symptoms persisted through the next night until morning when fever finally broke, and I was able to go to work.

He complained of an itchy forehead, which we began to monitor.  He then felt thickness of the base of the tongue, tingling of the lips.  He was given an oral dose of 25mg of Bendryl.  We began to monitor his pulse ox levels.  He remained at 98-99 sat on room air.  His heart rate ranged from 60-68.  He then experienced more itching of the arms, and continued itching of the forehead, thickness of the tongue.  A second oral dose of 25mg Benedryl was given.  After continual monitoring for 45 minutes his symptoms began to subside.  After another 15 minutes he felt his symptoms had resolved.  His final pulse/ox reading was 99% with a pulse of 67.  He was instructed to follow up with his PCP.  He was also instructed to monitor himself for further symptoms.  ER protocols given.  He left on his own.

I was clear for 2 months prior to the first vaccination injection on 03/09/21.  Immediately after the first injection, I broke out with the hives that have lasted me the 21 days between injection #1 and injection #2.  Injection #2 was on 03/30/21 and the hives have gotten worse.  It has spread all over my legs and torso.

Shortly thereafter, I developed a sever headache along with fever, chills and lethargy. Sever body aches followed with joint pain throughout entire body. All symptoms lasted 24-36 hours. 48 hours later, still feeling stiff with aching back muscles and feeling tired.  Large underarm lumps have developed 72 hours after injection. All of the aforementioned occurred after the second injection.

When I woke up the next day, the hives and rash covered everywhere except my head.  I took a shower and it became hard to breath, my eyes were very light sensitive, nauseous, and very dizzy.  I tried to make it back to my bed, but fell twice.  The second time I fell I stayed on the ground for about 5 minutes.  When I got up, everything was back to normal.  I left soon after to the Hospital emergency room to get checked.

I read about the allergic reaction that some were getting. I tried anti-ich cream hydrocortisone 1, and  &#34;Benadryl&#34;. After several days, I still have the sever itching and started to use pharmacy Itch Spray (Diphenhydramine HCI 2%, Zink Acetate .1%) and the Cortisone Gel (USP 1%) intermittently.

I immediately administered Benadryl &amp; contacted his primary care physician Dr. We spoke to the on call doctor for Dr. and she said Benadryl should clear up the hives, but if conditions worsen she would prescribe an Rx for steroids. Rx for Steroids were submitted to our local  pharmacy, but we haven?t picked up as of yet. As of this evening, my husband?s hives continue to be inflamed and he?s been taking Benadryl as directed every 4-6 hours.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.  RADIOLOGY DIAGNOSTIC - CHEST PORTABLE 02/04 2051 *** Report Impression - Status: SIGNED  Entered: 02/04/2021 2059 IMPRESSION: 1. Findings highly suspicious for portal venous gas which can be seen in the setting of bowel ischemia.  Consider CT for further evaluation and/or surgical consultation. 2.

Final Report Signed by: M.D., Sign Date/Time: 02/04/2021 9:57 PM Impression By: - MD CT SCAN - CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS W 02/04 2140 *** Report Impression - Status: SIGNED  Entered: 02/04/2021 2214 IMPRESSION: 1. Ill-defined patchy opacities within the bilateral upper lobes, right middle lobe, in consolidative opacities within bilateral lower lobes which could represent aspiration, and/or multifocal pneumonia. 2. Small right trace left pleural effusions. 3. Diffusely dilated small bowel without a transition point and mucosal hyperenhancement involving the colon with areas of pneumatosis involving loops of small bowel within the left upper quadrant and portal venous air consistent with hypoperfusion complex. There is a small caliber appearance of the aorta and a flattened appearance of the IVC is well. 4. Intravascular air within the IVC and bilateral iliac veins could be secondary to right femoral central lying injection. 5. Somewhat abnormal enhancement pattern of the kidneys with hypoenhancement of the medullary pyramids which may suggest hypoperfusion injury as well. 6. Probable nondisplaced rib fractures on the right at ribs 2 through

                                                Patient at appointed time for second dose and related this event. Patient reported that the vaccine site became progressively painful, swollen and bruised starting the day after the vaccination.  The swelling progressed including his hand, numbness in the ulnar nerve area. By 3-4 days after vaccination he was unable to lift his shoulder so  he saw his PCP who suspected a hematoma or thrombus but found neither. He then saw an orthopedist Feb 3 or 4 who was uncertain but sent him to Physical Therapy with a diagnosis of axillary nerve  injury.    See continuation page

No ear pain, sore throat, fever, or other evidence of URI. Has happened once before in entire life, and that was with fever and sore throat.  After 16 hours of swelling and mild aching from swollen nodes, consumed Naprosyn 250mg 12 hours apart. 2 doses total. awoke the next morning with isolated, painless, 2 cm bullae on left abdomen, 3 cm bullae on left forearm, 1 cm reddened patch adjacent to arm bullae (suspected this area to also develop bullae). Discontinued Naprosyn. Abdominal bullae spontaneously drained. Reddened patch disappeared. 3 cm bullae persists but no growth or change. No new lesions, though right preauricular adenopathy slightly increased in swelling and tenderness.

The first dose of the vaccine, the pain started the second day and the injection site got swollen. But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

                                                30 minutes after receiving vaccine, felt like electric shocks in the head (two to three times). It stopped in the evening but got constant low headaches afterwards. Around 5pm, felt like a change in taste (saltier taste) that was temporary. Has uncomfortable wrist pain like twisting a screwdriver too much. Started feeling itchy today after 9 am. Face was swollen after waking up today and has subsided greatly since. Had very low fever last night and now feels like no fever. Right now, feeling has a lot of saliva and then have to swallow and little uncomfortable in arms and knees, and weakness. Only took one Aleve pill last night. Around 4:30pm, felt a little blurry for 5 to 10 seconds.

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Mar2021 00:30 (lot number: ENG6199) (at age 55 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization administered in a pharmacy or drug store. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included tramadol taken for numbing shot for tooth, start and stop date were not reported. No other vaccines received in four weeks. The patient experienced the following with his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Shot was painful and in about 15 to 20 minutes later everything felt fine. But by the time he and his wife drove out of town, he started to get HOT with the sweats, terrible headache, dizziness and started to lose his vision. He pulled over to let his wife drive and by the time he got out of the car he could barely navigate to the passenger side. They turned around and headed for the hospital, 8 min away, at this time he couldn&#39;t see anything, he was nauseated but knew the hospital was pretty close. During this whole time his heart rate never raced just kept and even beat. His breathing was also just fine. By the time they got into the parking lot his vision was slowly getting better, so they sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes with the air conditioner on as high as it could go. His wife read through the side effects, he was experiencing many on the list. They left without going in. Onset of the events was reported as 12Mar2021 12:45 AM. Treatment was not given for the events. The patient recovered from the event &#34;shot was painful&#34; on 12Mar2021; while recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Mar2021.

I was experiencing some moderate to severe pain in my left arm where the injection occurred.  It is almost 9 PM and the arm still hurts, but not like before. On a scale of 1 to 10 the pain factor was about 5 to 7. I was experiencing some mild shock symptoms (flush face). I couldn&#39;t use my left arm for anything, the pain was too great.

In hindsight, he is questioning whether there is an association between his COVID vaccine series and the clot. He recieved his 1st dose (reported above) on 3/13/21. Symptoms (gradually progressive redness, irritation, swelling) began approximately 3/28/21, but were not recognized as a blood clot at the time. He received his second dose on 4/3/21 (Lot EW0150) in the right deltoid muscle. He reported to the ED for treatment on 4/4/21 with continued worsening of symptoms. So far, his treatment is going well with no lasting deficits and continuing followup treatment.

                                                I received the vaccine about two - three inches from the center of the muscle and in back of center - it was more in back of deltoid than the front of my deltoid. When I first got the shot, I had a burning sensation from the site of needle to back of neck to behind my ear area. It felt like a burning aching feeling. My ear felt like it was clogged up and aching. I told the medical site about it and the doctor on site said that more likely they hit a nerve. My blood pressure was very elevated. They had me stay to be observed for 45 minutes. I went back to work. I still felt it at night. The next day, I started feeling up my neck and my collarbone and my left side of my face and my head - my face felt tight and my lip felt numb on the left side and I had a slight confusion too. I went to Emergency room. They did CAT Scan and exam. After that, I noticed it was going all the way down my arm, all the left side of my body to toes. It felt like numbness - like neuropathy type feeling. It felt like constant pain. I went to the Urgent Care and they gave me Prednisone steroid (5 days of it) 5 mg to help with inflammation.  I took that for the five days. I started noticing a little black bruising on my body. After that,  I went to the Urgent Care again and they gave me Naproxen  and and Dr gave me more Naproxen to take.  He took bloodwork, too. I went to the ER and I was still feeling sick and hot. They said it was anxiety. I am still going through it - I feel it on the spot where I got the shot - and on my neck and on my head and on my left eye and down on my legs a lot - some days are worse than others but not as bad as when I had the first symptoms.

                                                The needle was inserted high up on my left shoulder, which was quit painful.  When the vaccine was injected, it caused additional discomfort.  Within 30 minutes, the left shoulder joint became agonizingly pain with any movement and I had loss of mobility.  Several hours later, the pain continued to worsen and any movement of the arm caused debilitating sharp pain.    During the night I used ice packs and took Advil, however the problem continued to worsen.  Today I am very concerned that the vaccine may have caused an injury to my shoulder.

                                                I had pain at injection site, mild night sweats, and increased tinnitus (I have had tinnitus for many years) the night of / after the first and second shots (03/26/21 and 04/16/21)  After the second shot, I had less pain at the injection site, mild body aches, and increased tinnitus the night of the second injection.  However, the real reason I am reporting this is because after the second dose, the increased tinnitus continued intermittent, usually in the evenings. The tinnitus became especially pronounced on day 2 or 3, 4,  5 and day 8 - the ringing became so loud on the evening of day 2 that it seemed I was having trouble hearing the television. And on the evening of day 8 after the second dose, the tinnitus again became quite loud, with the additional symptom that external noises were annoying / irritated me.  I have had constant tinnitus for at least 20 years, and it almost never bothers me (or is even noticeable.) However, the tinnitus symptoms after the second Pfizer shot were pronounced enough that I thought I would report it. Of course, I can&#39;t be sure the tinnitus symptoms - especially those at days 4, 5 and 8 - are indeed side effects of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, but since I had increased tinnitus symptoms the night after both the first and second Pfizer doses, it would seem to me to probably not be a coincidence.

I noticed it about 24 hours after the shot.   I also have the totally normal soreness at the injection site that persists to this moment. I did have flu like symptoms (body aches, limb weakness arms and legs, malaise) on  4/28/21 from 1pm till 9pm but has resolved.  The First shot I do not remember which arm, I think it was the left but cannot be certain, but I had no side effects at that time.  I also have a very occasional twitch in my right upper arm that persists to this moment which is similar to the twitch in my left arm but is much much less severe and very infrequent.   Note I have specifically nickel allergy and a number of other minor allergies.   I also used to have benign fastulations that were random though my body which resolved  and has not been an issued since 2017.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic. Glucose 117 mg/dl (79-115 normal range), zinc 54 mcg/dl (60-120 normal range), CMV IGG AB &gt;10 u/mL (positive is &gt; or = 0.7 range). The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I received my first COVID dose on March 31, 2021, exactly 40 days ago. The evening of this first dose, my arm became very sore, particularly the muscle exactly where the injection was given (left arm). No redness or rash or any visible issue. I know a sore arm could be expected for a couple or few days, but this has continued to linger; the muscle has continued to ache every day since, specifically when I exert it such as lifting an object like a book or water bottle, or extending my arm straight out away from my body. It feels like somebody has punched me in the arm there or a pulled muscle of sorts. (My second injection April 22 was same arm.) There is no pain when my arm is at rest, but even a slight exertion causes discomfort, and lifting anything more than a few ounces or stretching it far from my body causes pain, as does trying to do a single push up. My arm was 100 percent prior to the injection and I could do 50 pushups no problem; now my left arm doing a single push up.

This 55-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in his left arm on 05Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Arthritis, Sinus problem, Asthma, Bipolar disorder. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date at age of 55 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced injection site pain, severe pain in his left shoulder after that second dose. Some major pain up around his shoulders and around the back of neck, his left side was worst. He said that the pain was shooting down to his heart. So he went to the hospital because he thought it was something to the heart. They tested him, they evaluated him but they ruled out anything that has to do with the heart. They checked his heart, he had a cardiac catheterization, and was ruled out, everything came out negative.  So, he just got out of hospital and was still developing the pain and it&#39;s on his left side, it&#39;s on his right side (as reported). He called all his doctors, they had no answers for him, now he was still in a lot of pain in both of shoulders like he was saying his left side was still the worst, and it has not gone away and the pain is still shooting down around his heart and shooting down around the back of neck and now it&#39;s going on the top of his legs.  He went to the bone doctor and he was getting an MRI done, because the doctors said nothing was torn in his arms or tissues. He stated the pain was around his arms, back and wraps down to the heart. He was in dire pain, 8.5/10 and had a feeling of it was related to the vaccine. He clarified the pain was in both shoulders and the left side was worse and that was the side he had his shot on.  Patient stated he had stomach problems, he was collapsed stomach. The outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He has heard that the vaccine would still be effective if delayed for up to 60 days and would like to confirm that. He confirmed that he had cellulitis and chills but said none of that was from the shot. He said that if he got the second shot he was worried about them double teaming his immune system.

He says any doctor who knows about cellulitis knows to check these things. He also says they checked his blood pressure and other things: see formal field. He said after the emergency room they sent him home and told him to follow up with his primary care provider and a podiatrist, which he has done. He says he saw his primary care provider the following Monday 03MAY2021 and the podiatrist he didn&#39;t see until Wednesday 05MAY2021.

                                                After first dose of Pfizer vaccine, I had a skin rash on the backs of both hands; small &#34;bumps&#34; in various isolated patches.  These went on for about a week and a half but had gone away by the second dose.  I used no product to control the itch for the first dose.  The second dose was on 5/1/21, lot # EW0173, same provider.  The rash is considerably worse after this dose.  Now I am getting large &#34;bumps&#34;  of various shapes that crop up all over my body, but usually disappear over the course of the day only to crop up at some other location.  These are irregular shaped raised areas, itchy, sometimes in lines, sometimes clusters.  Occasionally they are the tiny bumps like I got after the first dose.  The larger &#34;welts&#34; are usually about the diameter of a dime, but irregular in shape.  One of the more unique ones was like a worm shaped line, about 7 cm long but only 5mm wide or so.  At any given moment I usually have 4 or so areas on my body, usually hands, arms, trunk or neck area, that last about 6-12 hours before disappearing and a new batch crops up somewhere else.  I am using a topical Benydryl gel to control the itchiness and that is working very well, and makes any given spot disappear more quickly.  It&#39;s nearly 4 weeks after dose #2 but it&#39;s not occurring less often like it did after the first dose yet.  I am hoping this whole body reaction will eventually run its course and the rash goes away.  One other detail:  the Lisinopril I had been taking was new-- this could be a reaction to it as well.  I started my first course of it at 10mg one week before the first dose.  I saw no adverse reaction of any kind during that week.  Then I got the first dose of vaccine and the hand rash began 2 days later.   On April 30, I was switched to the final regular dose of Lisinopril of 20mg and the very next day got dose #2 of the vaccine.  The new rash once again started a few days later and got worse over time.   So could be associated with the Lisinopril but my sense it more likely the vaccine given the first week of the med had no reaction of any kind,

There is no confirmed linkage to my COVID vaccinations but I thought I should report this as a possible vaccine reaction given the close proximity of shingles onset to my last COVID shot.

                                                I did not experience any adverse symptoms with the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with the exception of injection site pain after the first dose that began on day 2 through day 5 or for 3 days.  The first Pfizer-BioNTech dose was received on December 30, 2020, LOT EK5730. I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS on 12/31/20.  Please note that I completed the same pretreatment protocol 1.5 hours prior to dosing with Pfizer-BioNTech of Diphenhydramine 25 mg plus Pepcid 20 mg for both COVID-19 doses.  I elected to complete a self-administered pretreatment protocol due to a shellfish allergy and literature reports of anaphylaxis with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in food allergy recipients.  I did not experience any adverse symptoms on Saturday afternoon after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at 4:45pm on 1/23/21.  On Sunday morning 1/24/21, I awoke feeling &#34;cold.&#34;  I dressed warmly, but the feeling progressed to chills by 3pm.  Malaise ensued around 1pm.  I also experienced injection site pain on the morning of 1/24/21 beginning at 7am.  The pain lasted until 1/25/21.  I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS ON 1/24/21.   I began to feel uncomfortable with malaise and chills at 6:15pm on 1/24/21 and self-administered one dose of OTC Aleve, Naproxen sodium 220mg plus one dose of Benadryl 25 mg.  I began to feel better by 9pm on 1/24/21.  I awoke on 1/25/21 without any symptoms or discomfort with the exception of some injection site pain (2 out of 10 on VAS).  I have been asymptomatic since 1/26/21.

After 30 minutes post administration patient said he felt he was ok to go and he said he could feel the Benadryl helping. About 7:15p pharmacist called patient cell number and patient said he could feel the Benadryl working and felt sleepy but better than before. He said he thought that maybe he just got nervous.

                                                I was symptom free when I went to bed four hours after vaccination.  In the middle of that first night (03/02/21), I awoke with an overall body ache, which persisted through the next day.  In the morning of the next day (03/03/21), I awoke with soreness at the vaccination site, tightness in my chest, and a swollen, red left ankle.  The overall achiness and sore arm were understandable, but the chest tightness made we wonder if inflammation in the region persisted from my cardiac ablation in May 2020 and was aggravated by the covid vaccine.  I have a Kardia home-test ECG monitor, and the results of the test continue to be &#34;normal.&#34;  As far as the ankle, an MRI in August 2020 determined that I had torn my peroneal brevis tendon.  After six weeks in a walking boot, I began physical therapy and noticed that if I exerted myself too much that I would get swelling and soreness.  Everything in my ankle was healed by October 2020, and I have been hiking / running four times a week since without incident.  I did not injure myself before the vaccination, so it seems to much of a coincidence that inflammation returned to my previously injured ankle just hours after receiving the covid vaccine.

                                                First injection - only a sore right deltoid (injection site).  Fairly intense but only lasted 24 hours and easily alleviated by Tylenol. Second injection - Ringing in my ears - noticeable starting about 9pm the day of the second injection (3/11/21) and it&#39;s still going strong.  Intensity of ringing has remained constant to date unfortunately.  Headache was minor and on &amp; off starting the night of the injection date and appear to still encounter them but intensity has been low.  Taken Tylenol to alleviate symptom with success.  Soreness at injection site - less intense on second shot than first but it lasted about 48 hours.  The Tylenol I took for the headache seemed to help with the arm pain.  On the day after the injection, my right latissimus dorsi (same side as shot) became sore but only for about 24 hours. Tiredness - didn&#39;t feel the exhaustion until about 9pm on the day of the injection.  Exhaustion/tiredness set in more than expected so very low activity the day after and went to bed several hours earlier than normal.  Still feeling tired but emerging from that as i&#39;m starting to feel more energy come back.

At first I thought it might be scratches/irritation from sharp edges on a torn leather sofa, but more red welts appeared in unrelated locations: chest and back.  I have had childhood chickenpox, and have also considered stress as a possible trigger for shingles, but that seems remote to me.

Patient reported prior to the start of the session he received his first COVID vaccine on 03/16/2021 and the proceeding 24-48 hours following had nausea, diarrhea, fever, and increased redness, swelling, and warmth of the right arm.  Patient had a recent right shoulder surgery and received his injection in the surgical arm.  Comparing his arm from Monday&#39;s visit to when he presented on Friday there was a significant change around his incision with increased redness, warmth, and firmness of his arm tissue.  Call was placed immediately to patient&#39;s surgeon office and patient was seen later in the day by his surgeon for further follow-up.  Therapy was put on hold for the day.   Patient seen by surgeon 3/19/2021, arm warm to the touch so oral antibiotics started. Unsure if related to covid vaccine. Patient seen again 3/19/2021, still some warmth to mid humerus area and swelling that has been present since surgery. No active infection noted.

                                                On Thursday April 1, 10 days after the vaccine (1st shot)  I began to experience itch hives all over my body.  I took Benadryl at 2 pm and 8 pm to relieve the symptoms. It helped. At 7 am,  morning of Friday April 2,  I took Claritin to relieve symptoms but it was not effective. At 9:15 am,  morning of Friday April 2,  my lips and cheeks began to go numb, and it felt as if my throat and tongue were swelling.  At 9:30 am. I checked in to the ER.  They monitored my condition and indicated my blood pressure and oxygen levels were normal. At approximately 10:15 am, my mouth began to feel normal again. While at the ER, the  doctor checked out my hives and gave me Prednisone. She also gave me a prescription for 4 days of Prednisone, 50 mg tablets,  and advised to continue taking Benadryl to relieve symptoms. I have taken Prednisone once a day for past couple days and Benadryl 3 times a day. Hives are still present today Sunday April 4, 2021 but milder than previous days.[Not certain if this is important, but on  day 3 and 4 after the vaccine, I reported dizziness on mobile app check-in. The dizziness went away by day 5. I had no other symptoms appear until day 10 reported here.

My arms, chest, back, and legs. As the day went on and I moved around, the hives disappeared. Before going to bed, I noticed that my left eye was mildly swollen. The next morning, I woke up and the hives returned. Again, after moving around, the hives went away. Later in the late afternoon and into the evening, I noticed that both of my eyes were swollen and so was my upper lip. I woke up and the hives returned, only one eye was swollen and my lip was swollen. By later in the afternoon, the hives and swelling had just about disappeared. The following morning, I was back to normal with no hives and no swelling around my eyes or lips.

                                                Within 30 minutes of receiving vaccination  started having minor nerve sensations at random places throughout body. The sensations (pins &amp; needles, itching, crawling, tingling and minor energy zaps well below skin)  continued regularly  but were never severe.    On April 10th I started taking. 1 tsp of L-glutamine Supplement which I have previously taken with no issues.  Neurological paresthesia increased once I?ve started taking supplements. After about one week I made the connection and stopped. Symptoms decreased but have not ceased. Rather they went back to levels they were before taking the L glutamine.

He was 2 or 3 and almost died but came out of it; His mom had cancer from smoking, he got the worse flu sick of his life. His stomach was sensitive all of the time. If he was too happy or too nervous get upset. He can eat spicy food, not super hot, but he can eat anything and it doesn&#39;t go crazy. He has a little bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes. He can&#39;t take a multivitamin or supplements because he would get sick to his stomach, this was before the vaccine. He was getting that same sick feeling now that he would get if he was taking a multivitamin. He had his blood drawn a week before he had the vaccine to check his kidneys with the pills he is on. It was perfect and normal, and he has had nothing since then. In his 20s he had the flu vaccine, and he had never had the flu in his life. That year he got the worse flu sick of his life. He never got the flu vaccine or other vaccines after that. That was probably between 1987 to 1990. His folks passed away. He had been in the hospital when he was little.Concomitant medications included acetaminophen taken for back pain, sciatica from an unspecified start date and ongoing; nabumetone taken for sciatica, back pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient experienced he passed out for 2 days (medically significant) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, been sick pretty much everyday (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 22:00 with outcome of not recovered, not feeling good in his stomach (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, slept all day for several days (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, responding strangely to people/but is still there and is so weird (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his whole torso hurt and his stomach (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, diarrhea (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really irritable (non-serious) on 09Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, he had no energy (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of recovering, he was lethargic/weakness (asthenia) (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, dizzy (non-serious) on 10Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast (non-serious) on 17Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, breathing hard (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, wouldn&#39;t feel good (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, arm started hurting where he got the shot (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, headache (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, his arm was a little sore (non-serious) on 13Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, a fast heartbeat (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, chills (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown. Patient got sick around 10:00 at night. He was supposed to get his second dose but he was so sick and they said lets give it a week. Then he talked to his doctor and he said to wait 2-3 weeks to make sure he is back to normal. So he is scheduled for the second dose next week at 6 weeks. He asked if it was okay that the shot was given in the sunlight. He stated that he saw that it was in an ice chest but the person had to walk it over to him 20 feet and deal with his sleeve for a second or two so it was in the sun. He said all that walking it was 100% in the sun and he has read that it should not be in the sun. He asked if this could have caused bacteria and caused his symptoms. He stated his doctor was only concerned about giving him antibiotics for bacteria if it was in the sun and if that was a problem. He just read from CDC, once mixed the vaccine can be left at room temp for 6 hours and mixed vaccine does not need to be protected from light. So it sounds like his first shot was good. He had gotten the shot at about 1430 in the afternoon. He was like he is going to get the shot and everything will be great. He didn&#39;t think there would be an effect. Then strangely enough at about 2200 he was about to eat dinner and he got to not feeling good in his stomach. It had been close to 8 hours. The next day he slept all day, got up and had coffee, and Saturday he was in the chair in the living room. He is never in the chair during the day because he works. He slept all day and all night and the next day. He was responding strangely to people, and he was in and out of it. He had the shot on Wednesday and then his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting. He has back pain anyway and bone spurs on his spine. He was telling his wife whatever pain he is normally in was enhanced. His whole torso hurt and his stomach. The following Monday he had diarrhea. Then he started getting really irritable and didn&#39;t want to talk and was impatient. He was lethargic and had no energy. That was the second week. By the end of the second week he had a couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast. He thought it was a heart attack, then thought it was just pain not a heart attack. Every time he wouldn&#39;t feel good he would start breathing hard. Once in a while he gets pain through his chest area. His stomach would start and he would breath hard every time he didn&#39;t feel good. The third week he was supposed to get the second shot. He called the department of health for New Mexico. The nurse called back and said not to do the shot that week but to wait a week. He rescheduled for a week later. By the third week he was still not feeling good and called the doctor. He asked about the pain in his chest 3 times and he said it seemed to be okay. His arm started hurting where he got the shot in the second week. He still had no energy and he told the doctor this. Patient started taking 2 extra Tylenol during the day for pain. Lately he has been good until one little thing and then all of a sudden his stomach is hurting and he is holding his stomach. He was good today, all he did was eat a cookie and he didn&#39;t get sick. He was worse for a little while in the first or second week, he was really bad. It came and went over the next 2 weeks and now it is coming and going less frequently. He slept through 2 or 3 days. Thursday, Friday, and then Saturday he was in and out. He woke up to take the garbage out on Friday then saw he already took it out and forgot it was out there. And it was Saturday. He was kind of out of it. When he would respond strangely he would respond with a question he just asked and someone answered. It is like brain fog or like he is on something. It started after the weekend, more on 12Apr2021. Once in a while he will forget a little something still, but just once in a while. He would walk and hold his rib cage with both arms when he was hurting. He wrote down that it felt like somebody had hit him in the back with a bat in the lower back. One day it was that bad. His back pain was on Thursday 15Apr2021. The pain now is not like where it hit him with the back. He has back pain every day but more than he used to. The sore like he was hit in the back pain was just the one day. He had diarrhea 12Apr2021, 13Apr2021, and 14Apr2021 then it left for probably a week. Then it came back last week one day. Instead of every day it was every 3 or 4 days. He has not had it in the last 4 days. He hopes it is done. He noticed any time he has salad or lettuce he feels bad in the morning so he stopped eating those. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. The irritable feeling started right away the Friday of the week he got the shot. He is still struggling some, it will come and go. Yesterday he was zonked. With having no energy it is a big thing. He has to do something instead of what he would be doing. He works all day and takes long orders and stuff. Now he does like one order when normally he did 10. One for him is a huge little sore so he will lay on his right side. His left arm still hurts like a pulling hurt from his neck to his arm. It has been every day from 13Apr2021. It is much better and he will move and it will relax a little bit. It was really weird. The whole time he held the phone with his left hand up until one second he moved his phone and it was the same pain. At night the left side where he had the injection pulls on his neck muscle coming from his arm. He was actually taking two Tylenol in the morning and two at night when he went to bed. With the pain he takes 2 during the day, 650mg each. He was just taking 500mg and then his wife said take these. It seems to have gotten a little better. He always took them 2 times a day and now he takes them 3 times a day. After the first dose he experienced difficulty breathing dizziness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, chills, nausea, headache, he passed out for 2 days and has been sick for 5 weeks. He started having some dizziness a couple of days later and reports, it&#39;s like I would stand up too quickly and get a head rush, that kind of dizzy feeling. He confirmed that his dizziness did not start until a couple of days after he received his first dose.

A 56-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 11:15 (at the age of 56-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Penicillin allergy, pain, arthritis, was hospitalized when the patient was small for 15 days in a bubble following an allergic reaction, and had knee surgery. Concomitant medications included ongoing vitamin c [ascorbic acid] taken to make sure he doesn&#39;t catch a cold; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN BAYER) taken for pain, arthritis, and as a preventative to make sure he doesn&#39;t get any clogs; and ongoing ascorbic acid, betacarotene, biotin, boron, calcium, calcium pantothenate, chloride, chromium, colecalciferol, copper, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, iodine, iron, lycopene, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, nicotinamide, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, silicon dioxide, thiamine, tin, tocopheryl acetate, vanadium, vitamin k nos, zinc (CENTRUM MEN) taken for multi-vitamins, after a certain age you need to take a multi vitamin. On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t move his body, wasn&#39;t feeling like himself, he started having chills, shivering, and fever yesterday (29Mar2021) then had a rapid test and he came positive, and butt cheeks hurt; on an unspecified date, scalp hurt, and everything hurts. Brushing his teeth hurts. It was further reported that they went to take a rapid test in the morning of 30Mar2021 and he came positive. The patient didn&#39;t have problems Friday/Saturday/Sunday. Yesterday (29Mar2021), he woke up and he felt like he&#39;s been having aches and pains and when he took a shower, washing his head hurt. And his butt cheeks hurt from sitting down. He&#39;s allergic to penicillin and they kept them there for 30 minutes. Everything was fine. No side effects from Friday through Sunday. But yesterday (29Mar2021), he started having chills, shivering, and fever. Additionally, it was reported that the patient was tested for Covid-19 prior to getting vaccinated and the results were negative. The wife also clarified that last night, 29Mar2021, the patient had chills, couldn&#39;t move his body, and had a temperature of 101-102. Therefore, they both made an appointment to get tested at 09:30 this morning (30Mar2021) to get tested. The patient&#39;s test came back positive. The wife again states they are going back tomorrow for a rapid and mouth Covid-19 test. Furthermore, it was reported that yesterday (29Mar2021), her husband woke up and wasn&#39;t feeling like himself. In the night, he was hot, shivering, and his temperature got up to 101. The patient&#39;s temperature was not so high this morning but that he still wasn&#39;t feeling himself. He began not feeling like himself yesterday morning, 29Mar2021. The patient confirmed that he still feels unlike himself today. The wife also reported that every time her husband would move he said that everything hurts. Brushing his teeth hurts. He even said his butt cheeks hurt. When her husband was taking a bath and passed the soap over his head, his scalp hurt. The wife makes the comment that this isn&#39;t like her husband. The patient works like a mule and doesn&#39;t complain about anything. That&#39;s why the wife got worried. For example, the patient had knee surgery and walked out limping but did not use a cane because that was the kind of man he is. He was not whiner so when he tells you something&#39;s wrong, something&#39;s wrong. The patient&#39;s second dose was scheduled 16Apr2021. The patient was allergic to the penicillin class in generalized. When the patient was small, he was hospitalized for 15 days in a bubble following an allergic reaction. The wife reported that the patient drinks (takes) every day religiously one Centrum for men, one Vitamin c, and an aspirin. She clarified all the medications that her husband drinks (takes) he has been on for at least 10 years, since he was 35 or 40 years old, tops. All of these medications are approved by the doctor. She mentions when she try and give her husband a pill, he just looks at it. He won&#39;t even drink (take) a Tylenol. Her husband works construction and was around a lot of dust. Sometimes, he will work with Clorox and stuff like that cleaning towers, so he just takes Vitamin C to stay safe. Their son was a vet and when her husband helps their son with the animals, he takes it to make sure he was clean. She also clarified that her husband drinks (takes) the aspirin that was for arthritis because he&#39;s 57 and has worked very hard. She believes the dose was 325 or 500, she was not sure. She clarified further it&#39;s the aspirin that&#39;s for body and aches. His doctor doesn&#39;t let him take any more than one tablet daily in case he gets cut, he could bleed. The patient takes the aspirin daily because both his dad and mom died of aneurysms so he was told to take an aspirin daily to make sure his arteries and everything are clean. It&#39;s a preventative to make sure he doesn&#39;t get any clogs and for the pain. She makes the comment unfortunately, their son that&#39;s 35 had to have 2 open heart surgeries. She and her husband have not been in contact with anyone. They have 3 small grandkids and a son with a history of open heart surgery. The wife reported that she and her husband live in a bubble. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101-102 on 29Mar2021 and COVID-19 test which was negative on an unspecified date in Mar2021 and then became positive   on 30Mar2021. On an unspecified date, the patient recovered from COVID-19 while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

                                                About 16 days after the 2nd shot, I began feeling very tired, fatigued, nauseous, and had a headache.  About 18 days after the shot, I still had the same symptoms but also developed a red rash on my left upper bac, left arm, and left shin.  The rash was painful and burned.  When touched, I could feel the pain shoot through my nerves.  I was seen by the PA referenced above, who treated it as shingles, but diagnosed it as a plant based reaction, as he could not be sure it was shingles.  I was prescribed Mupirocin and valACYclovir HCI.  I still had the fatigue and nausea for several days after starting the medication.  Despite receiving my 2 shingles vaccinations in September and December of 2020, it appears the Pfizer vaccine may have triggered a mild case of shingles.

                                                After my first shot I developed a red lump on my chest which grew slowly. Then another appeared on the back of head.  After my second shot the number of red bumps continued to increase on my chest and back of my head.  The existing lumps or bumps stopped growing outward and sort of flatten and they are now increasing in diameter.  In the past week I now have two lumps on my neck under my chin and several red bumps are beginning to appear on right arm.

I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

It looked very similar to a mild case of psoriasis. I have never had anything like this in the past. It resolved after a week.

This is the second of two reports. The reporter describes events following both vaccinations in a vaccine series. This report is for those events which occurred following the second vaccination.      A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3249), intramuscularly on 01Feb2021  (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s historical vaccinations included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 after which he experienced inflammation, joint pain and burning sensation in the joints. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The vaccination was administered at a hospital. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), tamulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) all from unspecified dates and for unknown indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Per the reporting physician, he got his first vaccine on 22Dec2020.  His MCP and PIP joints and SI joints started burning close to 3rd week in Jan2021. He had some minor SI pains intermittently before but none with hands. Continued hurting enough that he started taking Osteobiflex and fish oil and more tylenol for inflammation. After second vaccine on 01Feb2021 the symptoms he experienced after the first dose have been getting worse.  He mentioned that his hands burn all the time, at times like tonight bad enough that they keep him awake.  He has red nodular areas on some of his knuckles and a distinct nodule at the proximal ulnar aspect of my left 4th finger PIP that is uniformly erythematous. Not all knuckles have the same degree of burning, but all including thumbs have it. The SI joint pain is more variable and at time does not bother him, but the hands get swollen and tight to close everyday. He plans to start some prednisone tomorrow due to the progression of the burning. The clinical outcomes of the events burning sensation in joints worsened, swelling of hands, stiffness joints, inflammation, condition worsended, erythema, nodule on extremity were reported as not recovered. The outcomes of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administration and off label use were unknown.  It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021154881 Same patient, same drug, different AE, different dose of vaccine.

                                                One week after the vaccine the arm was very red and looked infected. He went to the doctor and was given Amoxicillin. But two days later he was feeling so ill he was in bed all day and had a horrible headache. He went back to the doctor 3-26. The doctor cut his arm open, drained it, flushed it and gave him an antibiotic shot in the rear end. He also prescribed Doxycycline and Linezolid because he believes its a MRSA infection. He did swab it but we don&#39;t have the results back yet. The wound is not as red today and my husband is feeling better. Should he get the second vaccine? the doctor said this was the second patient he saw that day with the same infection at the vaccine site. I received my vaccine the same time and had zero issues. The doctor thought maybe his arm was not sufficiently alcohol swabbed but I know he was swabbed as was I as we were in the same room. He has severe asthma so we wanted the protection from the Covid vaccine but want to know if it is safe to get the second vaccine? I have taken photos each day so I can share what his arm has looked like

                                                Evening of the second vaccine, I started developing flu like symptoms. By 2 o?clock in the morning I had a 103 fever and a rash all over my torso. Over the course of the next week, I developed fever blisters and swollen lymph nodes in my armpit on the side of the injection. I have some presently undiagnosed Nuro immune disease that may be transverse myelitis. The Covid vaccine exacerbated all of the symptoms of the Neuro immune condition.

Next morning, &#34;pinching feeling&#34; in left underarm. After continuing to feel this, I finally went and looked and found a &#34;red spot&#34; at the point of the greatest soreness and also noted swelling of the general area. This soreness has continued on through to today (3/29/2021).

My forehead and upper cheeks also developed small red spots. The spots and redness reduced to close to normal after approx 90 mins. I did not report this reaction to anyone. I was also extremely tired most of the day of the vaccine. I felt fine the next day and had no redness on my face.

A 57-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 57-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included joint pain and ongoing 45-packs per year smoker. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), hydroxyzine (manufacturer unknown) and diclofenac sodium (manufacturer unknown). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The physician reported, &#34;patient had anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema on separate hospitalization (I was not involved for this but reviewed photos and this was reportedly attributed to the vaccine; I&#39;m uncertain if that event was reported). On hospitalization, the patient was with small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism on a CT PE (CT scan for Pulmonary Embolus). Patient is an active smoker. No other obvious cause.&#34; As a result of the adverse events (unspecified), the patient was hospitalized for one day. The start date of the events was on 29Mar2021. The patient was treated with apixaban (for pulmonary embolism). The clinical outcome of &#34;anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema&#34; and &#34;small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism&#34; was resolving.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for events pulmonary embolism, anaphylactic reaction and associated generalized rash and generalized erythema. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

On 06Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 6 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalized due to pneumonia and remained hospitalized at the time of reporting. The patient was also hospitalized in 23Mar2021 for COVID. Since 06Apr2021, the patient remained hospitalized due to COVID. On 16Apr2021, the patient had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID, AHRF secondary to Influenza B exacerbating PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (acute respiratory failure, hospitalized, medically significant), pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) exacerbation, AHRF (acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, pHTN treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hospitalized and medically significant), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (influenza, hospitalized), volume overload (fluid overload, hospitalized). On 16Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 16 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalised due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID and for AHRF secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, then transferred to the other hospital with volume overload and diuresis. The patient was presented with volume overload and needed oxygen requirement (none needed at home prior to both hospitalizations). The patient&#39;s breathing and oxygen were improved with diuresis. Patient&#39;s pulmonary hypertension was treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus. Patient was given intravenous (IV) solumedrol (25 mg in AM and 16 mg in PM) as per the discussion with rheumatology and pulmonary hypertension cardiology with improvement in oxygen status. On 24Apr2021, the patient relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included: complete blood count (CBC) WBC (white blood count) 4.79, RBC (Red blood cell count) 3.31, Hgb (hemoglobin) 8.4, Plt (Platelet count) 146. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) Na (sodium) 141, K (potassium) 4.1, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 39, Creatinine 1.68, glucose 90.

On 26Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.41, RBC 3.30, hgb 8.3, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 37, creatinine 1.54, and glucose 90. The patient was discharged on 26Apr2021. Patient&#39;s physical exam at the time of discharge showed pulse 65 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, blood pressure (BP) 138/78 mmHg, temperature 36.5 °C and weight was 90.9 kg. The patient was breathing comfortably in no distress on 2 Litre nasal cannula (NC). Minimal crackles appreciated in the morning posteriorly. The patient had 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs and edema unchanged but overall leg size decreased. Continues to be pitting but improved on the day of discharge. Patient&#39;s discharge diagnosis pulmonary hypertension exacerbation. Patient&#39;s diuretics were increased from 40 mg daily to 60 mg daily and may needed more diuretics. Discharge medications included: Protonix (pantoprazole), Demadex (torsemide), Medrol (methylprednisolone), Citracal &#43; d (calcium citrate, ergocalciferol), Lanoxin (digoxin), Epipen (epinephrine), Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Folvite (folic acid), Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate). Patient&#39;s medications of Pepcid, Lasix, and Aldactone were stopped after discharge from the hospital. The patient was instructed to take pantoprazole 40 mg daily while on steroids and when steroids tapered, he had to discontinue it in future and would stop pantoprazole and resume taking home dose of famotidine. Patient was on nifedipine at home and physician thought to be the contributing factor to lower extremity edema so stopped taking the nifedipine in house. It was reported that steroid induced the diabetes. It was reported that the patient needs transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) due to had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) but not agreeable at that time. The patient tried ethacrynic acid 50 mg daily but felt it was not making a difference with his weight. The patient went back on the Bumex (bumetanide) on Friday. Patient&#39;s weight slowly coming down to see doing good later on Bumex, his rash subsiding and leg was healing. Patient&#39;s weight was stable at 155 lbs and had multifactorial stable shortness of breath (SOB). Patient&#39;s weight was above baseline and needed more diuretics. Patient had been in touch with his COVID positive brother who was symptomatic and refused to be covid testing quarantining at that time. On 24Feb2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 °F. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, CI 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight since discharge from the hospital. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose due to the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was updated to dose decreased and for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with nifedipine, and Medrol dose for the events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with COVID-19 Vaccine was not applicable. The outcome of the events of rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events of pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unreported date in 2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect products was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.   Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia, and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available,The casual association between the reported events and suspected vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities. Information on the batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known safety profile, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of drug ineffective, COVID-19, pneumonia, rash, pyrexia and diarrhoea cannot be excluded. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was secondary to COVID-19, therefore was also considered as related to BNT162B2. The other events were considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2. Steroid diabetes was considered as related to methylprednisolone and other events were unrelated to methylprednisolone. Oedema peripheral and limb discomfort were considered as related to nifedipine and other events were unrelated to nifedipine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ambrisentan (LETAIRIS), sildenafil citrate (REVATIO), calcium citrate, ergocalciferol (CITRACAL &#43; D [CALCIUM CITRATE;ERGOCALCIFEROL]), digoxin (LANOXIN), epinephrine (EPIPEN), escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), folic acid (FOLVITE [FOLIC ACID]), hydroxychloroquine sulfate (PLAQUENIL [HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE]); all ongoing, famotidine (PEPCID [FAMOTIDINE]) from an unspecified start date to Apr2021, furosemide (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]) from an unspecified start date to Apr2021, spironolactone (ALDACTONE [SPIRONOLACTONE from an unspecified start date to Apr2021, and apixaban (ELIQUIS).  On 23Mar2021, the patient experienced COVID-19 and pneumonia (COVID-19 pneumonia). The patient was hospitalized on 23Mar2021.  The patient was on oxygen at the time of reporting. On 06Apr2021, the patient had pneumonia. The patient was hospitalized due to pneumonia and remained hospitalized at the time of reporting. The patient clarified it as COVID-19 pneumonia. Since 06Apr2021, the patient remained hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. On 16Apr2021, the patient had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID, AHRF secondary to Influenza B exacerbating PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH,  Pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) exacerbation, AHRF (acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, pHTN treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus, AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH, volume overload. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 16Apr2021 to 26Apr2021. The patient was presented with volume overload and needed oxygen requirement (none needed at home prior to both hospitalizations). The patient&#39;s breathing and oxygen were improved with diuresis.  The patient was treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus. Patient was given intravenous (IV) solumedrol (25 mg in AM and 16 mg in PM) as per the discussion with rheumatology and pulmonary hypertension cardiology with improvement in oxygen status. On 24Apr2021, the patient relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included: WBC (white blood count) 4.79, RBC (Red blood cell count) 3.31, Hgb (hemoglobin) 8.4, Plt (Platelet count) 146. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) Na (sodium) 141, K (potassium) 4.1, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 39, Creatinine 1.68, glucose 90. On 25Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.51, RBC 3.24, Hgb 8.2, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 39, Creatinine 1.59, glucose 117. On 26Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.41, RBC 3.30, hgb 8.3, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 37, creatinine 1.54, and glucose 90. The patient was discharged on 26Apr2021.  Patient&#39;s physical exam at the time of discharge showed pulse 65 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, blood pressure (BP) 138/78 mmHg, temperature 36.5 C and weight was 90.9 kg. The patient was breathing comfortably in no distress on 2 Litre nasal cannula (NC). Minimal crackles appreciated in the morning posteriorly. The patient had 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs and edema unchanged but overall leg size decreased. Continues to be pitting but improved on the day of discharge. Patient&#39;s discharge diagnosis pulmonary hypertension exacerbation. Patient&#39;s diuretics were increased from 40 mg daily to 60 mg daily and may needed more diuretics. Discharge medications included: Protonix (pantoprazole), Demadex (torsemide), Medrol (methylprednisolone), Citracal &#43; d (calcium citrate, ergocalciferol), Lanoxin (digoxin), EpiPen (epinephrine), Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Folvite (folic acid), Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate). Patient&#39;s medications of Pepcid, Lasix, and Aldactone were stopped after discharge from the hospital. The patient was instructed to take pantoprazole 40 mg daily while on steroids and when steroids tapered, he had to discontinue it in future and would stop pantoprazole and resume taking home dose of famotidine. Patient was on nifedipine at home and physician thought to be the contributing factor to lower extremity edema so stopped taking the nifedipine in house. It was reported that steroid induced the diabetes. It was reported that the patient needs transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) due to had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) but not agreeable at that time. The patient tried ethacrynic acid 50 mg daily but felt it was not making a difference with his weight. The patient went back on the Bumex (bumetanide) on Friday. Patient&#39;s weight slowly coming down to see doing good later on Bumex, his rash subsiding and leg was healing. Patient&#39;s weight was stable at 155 lbs and had multifactorial stable shortness of breath (SOB). Patient&#39;s weight was above baseline and needed more diuretics. Patient had been in touch with his COVID positive brother who was symptomatic and refused to be covid testing quarantining at that time. In 2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 F. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, ci 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight since discharge from the hospital. In 2021, the patient experienced had fever, temperature 101.1 F. On an unknown date, the patient experienced had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation), steroid induced diabetes, lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs, weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs, rash, diarrhea, and leg healing (limb discomfort). In 2021, patient weight was up by 4 lbs since discharge from hospital. The action for nifedipine in response to the events was unknown. The action for methylprednisolone in response to the events was unknown. The action for treprostinil diolamin in response to the events was unknown. The outcome of the events COVID-19 pneumonia, drug ineffective, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unknown date in 2021.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia , and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the consistency with the known safety profile of the suspect product BNT162B2, events of COVID-19 pneumonia, Drug ineffective, Fever, Diarrhea could be related to the suspected drug of BNT162B2. All the other events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.  The reported events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Nifedipine.  The events of Diabetes steroid-induced is most likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus. All the other events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Medrol.   Medical history of ongoing Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH/ High BP disorder/ increased pressure of pulmonary circulation), ongoing Systemic lupus erythematosus, and ongoing Dyspnoea may provide explanations for some of the events (such as Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Volume overload, Mitral regurgitation, and Oedema peripheral).   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Heart rate increased; Swelling arm; Arm soreness; soreness at the vaccine injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 13:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) at an unspecified dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was reported as &#34;no pre-existing conditions.&#34; He mentioned that he reviewed his allergies with a pharmacist prior to vaccination but did not specify what his allergies were. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was a tobacco user from an unknown date. The patient also reported a history of pneumonia which was reported to have occurred on seven different occasions following each of seven different vaccinations with the flu vaccine (manufacturers unknown) prior to 2013. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. He stated that after receiving the COVID 19 Vaccine he had side effects. He said the side effects went away at twenty four hours later, but he is still having one side effect, and has a concern. He clarified that he has an elevated heart rate since getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He said he has never had an elevated heart rate before getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He reported his heart rate is normally low, between 62-65. He said when he was at work on 28Dec2020 his heart rate was OK, but prior to going to bed that night his heart rate was 93 - 95. He said he thought at first he was just stressed. He also reported the COVID 19 Vaccine is the only thing he has taken. He mentioned that his heart rate has been down to 93, but then up to 105, and higher. He specified that he first presented with an elevated heart rate between 4:00 5:00PM on Tuesday, 29Dec2020. He said the elevated heart rate subsided enough for him to sleep later that day. He said he then started work around 10:00AM today, 30Dec2020, and felt the elevated heart rate in himself, and didn&#39;t say anything to anyone at work. He said when his heart rate got bad, it was about 12:30PM today and that today (30Dec2020) at work he didn&#39;t feel right at lunch, so he took his oxygen level and heart rate. He said his heart rate was 141. He said he called his primary care doctor, but didn&#39;t go to the emergency room. He said he doesn&#39;t have chest pain. He said he said something about his heart rate to a staff member at work, and the staff member tested his heart rate, and told him it was 141. He said he spoke to the nurse at his doctor&#39;s office, and the nurse said the doctor couldn&#39;t do much, and that he could go to emergency room or their practice&#39;s urgent care that is open until 7:00PM.  He said he tried to go to the hospital emergency room, but ended up driving by because the hospital was so busy they were triaging patient&#39;s in the parking lot. The patient also experienced arm swelling and arm soreness following the vaccination on 28Dec2020. He said he could feel the soreness at the vaccine injection site when he moved his left arm. He stated that the swelling was down to his biceps and it resolved within 12- to 14 hours after the vaccination. As treatment, the patient took a generic 81 mg Baby Aspirin (UPC Number: 050428323922, Lot Number: P110657 Expiration Date: May2020) on 30Dec2020 between 3:00 and 3:30. The patient stated that the generic 81mg baby aspirin was an expired product. The clinical outcome of heart rate increased was not recovered and the clinical outcome of arm swelling, arm soreness and vaccination site soreness was recovered on 28Dec2020.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, on 22Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID 19 immunization. Relevant medical history included COVID infection last Apr2020. On the peak of the COVID pandemic he had the COVID infection, he lost the sense of taste and smell, had diarrhea although he did not have fever and did not have coughing. He also has medical history of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome. He was tested for COVID, he was positive 2 times and then they did PET scan, MRI from head to toe. They were looking for tumor, neuroblastoma, what was causing the shaking, the myoclonus, the opsoclonus, the ataxia, they could not find anything. They gave him convalescent plasma and then they gave him immunoglobulin human normal (IVIG) 5 doses and they gave him high dose of steroid to the point that his blood sugar was reaching sky high they have to give him insulin. He was hospitalized 2 times, 3rd time was 2 days and sent home and then it got worst, so he was readmitted for another &#39;3&#39; days. So, he was sent home on clonazepam, it makes him drowsy and he went for physical therapy and slowly after almost after 8 weeks his symptoms disappear, and he was able to go back to work. His symptoms all recovered by the end of May, towards the beginning of Jun2020 he went back for the swab test, it was negative, COVID PCR negative and my antibody was positive. Concomitant medications included clonazepam, metformin and simvastatin. Patient went back to work and have no symptoms until this 07Jan2020. Like almost 3 week or two and half weeks after he received the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Two and half weeks later he started having symptoms like shaking of the hands that I could barely write and yesterday he could barely walk down the stairs. The patient received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Dec2020. Immediately after the vaccination the patient felt that his hands became weak. He ignored it because it went away, like after a minute or so it went away. He went home and nothing happened, except for the soreness of the arm the injection site for 2 days, which really did not bother him. Then this past Thursday, 07Jan2021, he went to the church, he was lightning a candle and his hands started to shake, he can barely light a candle. He was able to do it although his hands were shaking. So, he went home. He ate breakfast, and called his neurologist and he said just to observe and then it went away. On Saturday night (09Jan2021) he noticed that his hands were shaking again when he was typing in the keyboard. He can manage to type but his hands were shaking. He went to sleep and just ignored it. Then yesterday, Sunday he worked again, it became worse, his handwriting was shaking. He was really holding on to the pen to write legibly and then he was in the third floor hospital, elevators did not work. So, he walked down through the stairs, both of his legs were shaking very bad while he was walking down three slides of stairs but he thought he came to the ground so he was able to walk on the flat floor on the street and able to walk home. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Outcome of the event tremor was unknown, while for the other events was unknown. The consumer considered a causal relationship between the events and the vaccine.

                                                upper bicep pain/soreness around upper part of bicep; tendonitis; lymphadenopathy; sore deltoid; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Healthcare Professional (patient).  This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it&#39;s still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it&#39;s lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can&#39;t think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn&#39;t want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn&#39;t know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node&#39;s reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020. His second dose is scheduled tomorrow (14Jan2021) and wants to know if he can still take it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events myalgia and lymphadenopathy were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tendonitis with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Injection site pain; Arm pretty sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician who reported for himself. A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot #: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 at 09:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included a history of anaphylaxis to latex which predated treatment with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, heart rate control, hypertension and high cholesterol; all from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s medical history was &#34;none&#34; and that the patient had no illness at the time of vaccination. Family medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications included ongoing metoprolol taken for heart rate control taken from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for two years&#34;), ongoing telmisartan taken for hypertension orally from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for two years&#34;) at 1x/day (take once daily by mouth) and ongoing rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR; strength: 40mg) taken for high cholesterol from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for 10 years&#34;) at 40mg, 1x/day. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Dec2020 the patient experienced &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34;. It was reported that &#34;a physician called regarding the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he received the second dose of the vaccine on Thursday and was advised by his medical director to call Pfizer to report his symptoms. He reported that he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine three weeks prior to the second dose. The patient first stated that was about 14Dec2020, but then clarified that per his vaccine card, he received the first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at 0900AM in the left arm. The patient stated that he noticed injection site pain that lasted about two days and his arm was pretty sore. Both events completely resolved before the second dose.&#34; It was reported that the events did not require a visit to the physician or to the ER. It was reported that there were no relevant tests. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34; were both recovered/resolved on 15Jan2021.  The reporter considered that there was reasonable possibility (method of assessment: Global introspection) that the events &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34; were related to BNT162B2.

                                                No initial symptoms other than sore arm at injection site which lasted for about 23 hours. On January 28 in the middle of the night woke up with pain in left hand. Could not move left hand. Was sleeping on back - not on arm or hand.  No restricted blood-flow.  Massaged hand and it became responsive.  This was followed by burning and tingling sensation in hand.  Hand was cold to touch first day. Burning and tingling and muscle tension increased for first couple days.  Would be intermittent and location varied. Hands and feet most common. Left back scapular area and left pectoral muscle common.  Muscle tightness would cause joint pain without signs of any redness. No temperature. No discoloration. Not as bad in middle of the day. After a few days. When second shot was administered on February 9 at 12:10 AM went home and all sensations stopped for about 12 hours. Took Tylenol with some benefit to diminish but not end symptoms. In past few days have read about taking antihistamines which has often helped.  Symptoms are not as intense as they started out to be, but they continue to linger.  Muscle tightness has largely given way to fluttering sensation or paresthesia and burning is mostly in bottom of left foot only. Any muscle tightness can be rubbed out (massage) for the most part. Occasional joint tightness continues in fingers - crack knuckles and it improves.

Pt returned to work 03/01/2021 then checked into urgent care the following day d/t worsening symptoms. Patient Plan written by PAC: &#34;At this time the nature of your pain is not clear. Your cardiac enzymes are within normal limits except for myoglobin which often goes up with skeletal muscle pain. Your BNP test which can come up with congestive heart failure is elevated slightly from your normal.  We will want to recheck this in a week or so. Differential diagnoses could be skeletal muscle pain/injury, herpes zoster or shingles. (This can sometimes have sharp nerve type pain that will develop into a rash within the first 7 days.) Your rapid COVID test was negative.  We are sending a PCR test out just to confirm.  While awaiting test results please isolate at home. We will call you soon as results are back. Refer to Mendocino County&#39;s packet/isolation order. Your potassium level is low at 3.2.  It should be 3.6. We gave you some potassium to take in the clinic.  I am going to give you some to take for an additional few days. When you follow-up next week plan to have your labs redrawn.&#34; Plan Orders: SARS-CoV-2 RNA (COVID-19), QUALITATIVE NAAT to be performed. URIC ACID to be performed. The patient had the following medication order(s) completed today: Potassium Chloride 40meq PO; Toradol 15mg IVP.

                                                I had a single red blotch on my right ankle appear the day after my first vaccination. I did not complete an adverse reaction form for it because I was not sure it was related. When I got my second dose, I did not experience any reaction other than a sore arm until three days later. I developed red blotches/hives on my arms, legs, and torso (front and back).  I took two Benadryl on Sunday morning and two more that night.  They tended to go away and then others would pop up in other locations of my body. The Benadryl did not seem to have any significant affect. I was very itchy for several days. i went to see my doctor on the 5th day since it occurred over the weekend and I had an epi pen if I needed it. It was getting better when I saw her so I didn&#39;t want anything other than a topical, which didn&#39;t come in to the pharmacy until they cleared up. I stopped itching by Monday and they were pretty well gone by Wednesday, which was 7 days later. I took photos of the spots.

                                                Right Foot started hurting the night after the vaccine. The next day, it hurt to  walk on it. Mainly around the base of my 2nd and 3rd toes. The next day it hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t walk on it and saw the doctor. A red area had developed on top of my foot at the base on my toes. Doctor though could be Gout but didn&#39;t really look like it and usually that is in the big toes. Plus the timing of this issue and my vaccine were suspect. Had X-ray on that Friday, two days after vaccine and everything looked fine they said. I was prescribed Celebrex  and over the weekend took two per day due to the pain. I stayed in bed all weekend and pain got worse before taking another dose of medicine which helped for a while.  Swelling continued to be about the same or a bit more and the redness moved over to my big toe and then up my foot around towards the right side. Today my right side of foot is really soar now as well and still can&#39;t walk on it and still swollen. Doctor at a urgent care sports medicine location prescribed me Prednisone steroid to see if that helps. But so far 5 days after vaccine and my foot is still swollen, red across the top and so painful it keeps me up at night and I can&#39;t walk on it. I&#39;m hoping the steroids work.

                                                Approximately 45 minutes after receiving the shot I started experiencing some mild tingling/burning in my right shoulder (at the injection site). Shortly afterwards, I also noticed swelling and numbness in my hands and face. The swelling in my hands increased to the point where my ring finger on my left hand began throbbing. The ring is already tight due to weight gain, but I became concerned that I may need to cut the ring off. Throbbing plateaued and continued for about an hour then subsided. Swelling and numbness also plateaued and subsided, though those took longer (about 2 days). Overall, it felt a bit like the time I discovered that I was allergic to shrimp/lobster/crab but it did not progress to the same level (no trouble breathing with this episode).

On Saturday 3/27,21, almost 4 days later, at about 1:00 PM, felt hives breaking out on my sides.  It traveled up to my lower armpits, but never went into my arm areas.  Later that day, it traveled down side of legs, but then dissipated.  I went to bed about 9:30 PM that night with only slight discomfort. At 1:30 AM on Sunday 3/28/21, I awoke with severely swollen lips and face.  My breathing began to get difficult, so I immediately headed to the ER at  (about 30 minutes away). They at first started to give me a dose of Benedryl, but I explained to them that I am allergic to it.  I then instead received some Prednisone and immediately the swelling subsided.  Dr.  prescribed 15 pills over a 5-day span to totally clear up the reaction.

When I went back for my second dose they gave me my shot in my other arm and with in 12 hours the pain subsided a good bit. Since then there is no pain in my arm where the second dose was injected but my arm (left) is still very sore where the first dose went in. I called my PCP and they told me along with vaccines there may be pain up to 6-8 weeks but this seems highly unusuall and is still very painful at times for me to move my arm and hurts as i type this email.

At 1720 I was at home and started itch all over my, arms legs, and stomach. Broke out in a rash on my stomach and chest. At 1830 my tongue was swelling and had a hard time speaking. I call a friend and told her. She told me to take some Benadryl. I did. I then went to bed. My friend came over at about 2100 because she was worried and found me in bed. My breathing was off and she tried to wake me. She called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.  I am now in rehab with undetermined results as to what happened.

He swallowed a few times but was difficult to do so.  It then eased up and then 30 minutes later when he was getting up to leave he was light headed.  He walked out and got to the car, came home and still felt a little light headed, sat around for a couple of hours and was doing better.  He went outside to do a few things and was stumbling around and went back into the house.  He went to take a shower and still had the bandaide on his arm, took the bandaide off and while driving off he saw that he had a rash the size of a 50 cent piece around 7:30.  He got up the next morning and the rash was gone, the dizziness was gone and everything was fine.  He did not take anything for his reaction.

On the 2nd day, I experienced fatigue, neck/muscle pain, and my wife encouraged me to take my temperature and I found I had a slight fever of 100.2F.  On the 3rd day (4/12), I felt only slightly fatigued with some neck pain but no fever at all.  Today (4/13), I have only neck/muscle stiffness (no soreness/pain) and no fatigue. I still have soreness at the injection site, but consider it mild. I don&#39;t have my 2nd dose scheduled yet, but anticipate it to be around May 6th.

                                                Excruciating pain in ALL o my body.  The vaccine has triggered a Fibromyalgia episode from hell.  Extreme pain in ALL of my body.  It feels like all my nerve endings are on fire.  And when they are not on fire, they itch so bad, and I have scratched them so much, I have sores and scabs on my arms and legs from scratching a itch I can not reach.  Feels like the itching is under my skin.  Not on top.   1) Pain in ALL my body 2) High temperature - my house is 91 degrees and I&#39;m in a blanket and I&#34;m still cold 3) Even though I&#39;m cold - I sweat a lot 4) Have not been able to eat since I got the vaccine 8 days ago - growing very weak and loosing weight 5) I&#39;m dehydrated - Having trouble keeping liquids down 6) Bad stomach pains - sharp pains 7) Real bad gas and lots of it - Not normal for me 8) My kidneys hurt real bad - Probably clogged and overworked      I spend most of my time on the floor n my back.  Hurts too much to stand and walk   NOTE:  I&#39;m growing weak and very dehydrated.                   Something needs to be done soon !

Caller reported that the patient already had an appointment scheduled with his physician for 08Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s physician referred him to an allergist and the allergist prescribed Fexofenadine HCl 180 mg and Famotidine 40 mg. Caller reported that so far, the fexofenadine and famotidine seem to be working. It was also reported that patient had Burning sensation in esophagus on 08Apr2021. Caller reported that the concern of her and the patient is that the patient is scheduled to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine this Friday, 16Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist is recommending that he wait another 2 weeks to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are going to go to the appointment on 16Apr2021 and request for the appointment to be rescheduled for 2 weeks later. Caller reported that she is very concerned if the patient should be getting a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine or not. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist informed the patient that the patient could get Covid-19 and die from that, but that the patient won&#39;t die from the allergic reaction he is experiencing. Caller reported that she questions the allergist&#39;s opinion because of the misery that the patient has been in. Caller stated that she just needs some answers. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist had stated that there was one other person that he was aware of that had a reaction 10 days after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that it was odd that the rash had started 10 days in, and reported that the patient ruled out food and ruled out any changes as the patient hadn&#39;t changed soap or laundry detergent recently. Details were not provided for the other patient the allergist reported had a delayed reaction 10 days after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist thinks the Covid-19 vaccine caused the patient&#39;s reaction. Caller reported that she and the patient are scared about whether he should get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and are unsure of what she and the patient should do at this point. Caller stated that she knows that people don&#39;t like to give advice, but that they say if you have immediate adverse reaction you shouldn&#39;t get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that the patient&#39;s reaction wasn&#39;t immediate, and asked if it the rash should still be considered an adverse reaction and the patient should not go get second the second dose, or should the patient go with what his doctor said as it is recommended that you should listen to physician. Body rash: Caller reported that the patient&#39;s rash has dissipated for the most part. Caller reported that the patient still has some redness in parts, but the itching has subsided at least as of this morning, 12Apr2021, when she spoke to the patient around 6:00 AM. Hands swollen: Caller reported that the swelling the the patient&#39;s hands went down in the emergency room on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, night and began to dissipate on Thursday, 08Apr2021, with 50 mg of prednisone. Caller reported that she believes the patient&#39;s hands have returned to normal at this point, reporting that the patient is at work and as a mechanic, the patient has to work with hands. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s primary care physician did take blood work, but the patient&#39;s allergist said that the results of the bloodwork would probably not be relevant based on fact that the patient was on medication at the point that the labs were drawn. Caller reported that she believed the initial prescription for prednisone was 10 mg tablets. Caller reported that the patient had to take 4 tablets the first day, 3 tablets the second day, 2 tablets the third day, and 1 tablet after that. Caller reported that she and the patient are concerned about the patient getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are trying to anticipate what would happen after the patient received the second dose. Caller stated that she would like to know if someone would recommend or say it&#39;s ok for the patient to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and if the patient has a reaction, that it won&#39;t be as life threatening as getting Covid-19. Prednisone did not help rash, hives, or itching (10 mg tablets, dispensed in pharmacy bottle). Outcome of the events red, itchy rash; body rash; body rash/patient did have pretty much the exact same reaction 30 years ago in 1991 when he had the measles vaccine and was told not to take further measles vaccines after that; and hands swollen was recovering.

A 58-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 06May2021 11:15 am (Lot Number: EW0182; Expiration Date: Aug2021) as UNKNOWN, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included mouth surgery. Concomitant medication included omeprazole (PRILOSEC [OMEPRAZOLE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient stated &#34;I had the Pfizer shot (Covid-19 Shot) yesterday at 11 o&#39;clock (06May2021) and then I woke up this morning with a rash on my neck and my head and my shoulders (on 07May2021). So, I was wondering if that is something that I need to go to (sentence incomplete), I tried to take a Benadryl, but it didn&#39;t help. So, is it something that is going to pass?&#34;. Patient stated &#34;I got the shot at 11 o&#39; clock like 11.15 in the morning and then I started feeling it about 5:00 or 6:00.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                For many years, when I was younger, I must have had an over-active immune system, because I had those chronic red itchy rashes that wouldn&#39;t heal, on my knees, and elbows - the only places I got them.  For years, though - many years - I have not had this.  After my first injection of the Covid-19 shot I got a few patches - on my right side (knee and elbow) - the shot was on the left side.   I am reporting this because I read that in a few countries only give ONE of these shots to people that have already had Covid-19 (I had the virus almost a year ago) - and was wondering if taking the 2nd shot (since this first one overstimulated my immune system a bit) was a good idea.  Please email me about this concern.

It has increased subsequent to my second dose on 3/4/2021. I had no other significant symptoms after my first dose, but did have sufficient pain at the injection site in my left upper arm the day following my shot to wake me up at night. That went away within 48 hours, but the tinnitus effects have not decreased to date.

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 06Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pain, high cholesterol, and testosterone low, joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, any place in his body had pain, and doesn&#39;t have good memory, all ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrocodone for pain, ongoing atorvastatin for high cholesterol, ongoing clomiphene citrate for testosterone medication because it was low because of his age, ongoing colecalciferol (Vitamin D), ongoing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), ongoing oxycodone for pain, and unspecified eye medication. He had many different medications that he was taking. Historical vaccines included chicken pox vaccine for immunization and shingles vaccine in Jan2020 for immunization and experienced pain all over. The patient stated that he was a torture survivor and he has been taking pain medication because of him being tortured previously. He was taking medications for the pain, clarified to be hydrocodone and oxycodone. These medications kept his body stable. He was able to sleep and relax. One day after he received his Pfizer COVID vaccine (07Mar2021), he started feeling the pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse but the pain used to be stable with the way he was using his medicines. But now his body was not stable. Any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously because of the damage of torture but now it all came up after the COVID vaccine. Every piece of his body hurt even if he takes his medications. He still had the pain and his body was so weak for about 4 to 5 hours. He used to be able to do his business all day but now after about 3 to 4 hours on his feet he got so tired and he needed to sit. He didn&#39;t know why this happened. He has talked to others that have received COVID vaccines and none have had this kind of reaction like him. He has asked them about it. It was very frustrating to him on an unspecified date. Every month he sees a physician. He would like for Pfizer to contact him with further questions, he can&#39;t understand the pain. This was really killing him especially when the pain goes to his bones. He will keep him up until 3 in the morning and he stays awake on an unspecified date. He then took medicine and he had to wait for 30 minutes for it to start working and then he will be able to sleep. But other than that, the pain jumped. He has had the chicken pox and the shingles vaccines and none did like that. The pain was not going away in his muscles or joints. And now he was getting a headache on an unspecified date, it was really frustrating. He didn&#39;t have good memory from the torture. This morning, when he woke up, he had the pain in his joints and his bones. He didn&#39;t like to use too much medication. He liked to use it only as he needs it. Pain medications are strong. But this COVID vaccine somehow made him need to use more medication and then that caused him to have a headache. His pain should get better with his medications but today, he had pain all over him and he didn&#39;t have any energy to move. He didn&#39;t know how to explain it. The COVID vaccine had really kind of made him weak. Sometimes he drinks a lot of cranberry juice to try and take the vaccine out of his system and it was frustrating because he hasn&#39;t ever been like this. When he had pain like this it reminded him of his torturing and what had happened to him. When the pain came on strong was when it reminded him of that. The medications he was taking were supposed to kill the pain. That was the reason he got so pissed and was trying to ask what was going on. This COVID vaccine is not safe he believed because it has been almost 10 days and it was not helping him. He was still not good. After he got his COVID vaccine on 06Mar2021, he had a little bit of small itching, not much, just a little bit that made him feel not comfortable with it. That was why they kept him for 20 minutes after his vaccine. When he got back home, he was okay, it was nothing serious. But then the day after his COVID vaccine on 07Mar2021, his joints, his muscles and his bones had pain. On 06Mar2021 the itching lasted about 20 minutes. He felt like he was chewing his lip, he was a little uncomfortable and he felt his ribs moving quicker. Nothing happened but he could feel it. He tried to chew his lips a couple of times, but not that much. But after that, he had pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine, 07Mar2021. By the time this vaccine started getting into his body, it was really hurting and getting worse. He had the shingles vaccine and for 1 1/2 to 2 days, he had pain all over and then 2 days after it was all gone, he was back to normal life. The pain was gone. With this COVID vaccine he thought that maybe it was going to be the same but it was not the same and it was hurting. The shingles vaccine was last year in 2020, 3 months before people knew about the coronavirus that was when he got the vaccine for shingles, so maybe Jan2020 was when he had the shingles vaccine. He had no medical conditions or heart and chest problems. No other vaccine he has taken has ever had this type of side effect to him. He took his shingles vaccine in his right arm and the COVID vaccine was in his left. With both he had the same start of having the bad pain. This COVID vaccine goes deeply to the body. The vaccines job is to wake the body. The vaccine&#39;s job is to wake up the body for the virus. The body has to make some kind of soldiers to stand up on the virus and this COVID vaccine had actually made his body weak. After the vaccine is supposed to wake the body, little by little the side effects are supposed to go away. His body was not learning this vaccine. It kept fighting to learn whatever was in this COVID vaccine, his body can&#39;t learn it and fight it. That was the reason his body got weak and the pain has not gone away. His body is still in alert and that&#39;s why the pain was still there. His body was still fighting. Somehow it didn&#39;t match the inside of the body. Maybe for some people that this will happen to, they will be okay but for some they will not be okay. It is not because some people have nothing wrong with them. The patient recovered from itching and discomfort on 06Mar2021; not recovered from any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously/ pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse/ pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine; while outcome of other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

It then went up to 101.4 that evening, but he felt very hot.  He felt very hot, face was red.  Somebody brought him over a thermometer and checked it again and it was 101.7, felt terrible and he took Tylenol.  The next day he felt achy like he had the flu, a headache, body aches and weakness, nauseous as well.  Then the next morning it was 102.3.  It fluctuated throughout the day.  Then later it went to 102.7 at 9:00 PM.  Then about 2 hours later before he went to bed it came down to 101.  Then he woke up on Sunday morning 3/28/21 his temperature was normal, he was exhausted from the fever.   He felt run down for a few days after that, knocked out and the nausea came back on 4/3/21.  No reaction at the injection site, just standard arm soreness, rash below the area of injection that lasted for about a week and went away.   He is still more tired than usual this week, but doesn&#39;t know if that&#39;s related to the vaccine or not.    The right arm 8 days later he got a rash at the injection site and a little bump that felt swollen.  That also ended up going away after a day or so.

                                                About 2 days after my second shot of the Pfizer Vaccine, I experienced a rash on the back of my left shoulder and arm, not far from the injection site. It was around the back side of my upper arm and shoulder/arm pit area.  Rash had a hives like look (red bumps) and only on my left side. I also experienced a similar, but smaller rash on the back side of my right knee on day 3 after my second dose. These rashes were very itchy. It is now day 4 post second shot and the rash is still present but appears to be lessening a bit.

A 59-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EN6207, Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (at the age of 59 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lupus from 2020 and ongoing, ongoing High Blood Pressure, Spinal Surgeries from 1999, Chronic Pain,Retention water, blood clot issue. The patient previously had tetanus shot. Concomitant medications included losartan potassium; allopurinol; hydroxychloroquine; methocarbamol; morphine sulfate (MS CONTIN); oxycodone; furosemide.  Caller states he is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. Seven days later the dose of vaccine (18Mar2021), patient developed Bell&#39;s Palsy which he has never had before and has never had any other problem with. He has seen an ENT, his pain doctor, and his medical doctor and they all say the Covid vaccine has caused the problem he is having. He was told by his ENT this is very possibly permanent. Emergency Doctors are who he went to because he thought he was having a stroke, because half of his face went numb. He has been to the doctor 10 times in the last 7 days, it has not been fun at all. He didn&#39;t put it together until he saw the ENT, who said Bell&#39;s Palsy is caused from a virus. States he had no idea until he said that, that it could possibly be from the injection. States he has never had Bells Palsy before and it started 8 days after the initial shot. His right eyelid was sticking on his eye and wouldn&#39;t shut and he couldn&#39;t move his face on the left side and he can&#39;t control it at all. Clarifies he couldn&#39;t shut his right eye all of the way. Since then they have told him he needs to tape his eye shut for 12 hours a day to keep from going blind. The thing that bothers him is his eye sight in that eye is getting worse every day even though he uses the cream and tapes it shut. His wife told him even with both eyes shut, it will not completely shut because his lower eyelid is hanging down too far. The ENT told him he needs a hearing test today at 2:00p.m. to see if this is going to be a permanent problem. He is getting ready to go to the ear doctor to find out more. At the same time he developed the Bells Palsy, his blood got really thin and wouldn&#39;t clot which seems really weird. Also on 18MAR2021, his left hand got really swollen and the entire arm bruised and they said the edema in his hand got to the point where his skin was cracking because his blood got so thin that it couldn&#39;t clot at all. He had a blood clot issue in the past. States his arm and hand have improved, he can move his hand again finally. The ENT said that since he has been on Prednisone, for recovery for Bells Palsy, for over a week and gotten worse instead of better, it may be permanent. Prednisone is not working, it has actually gotten worse. Prednisone 10mg for 7 days and to decrease by one tablet every day until gone but states he has gotten worse. Treatments (assessed as for all events): Prednisone. States that it has been two weeks since this happened and the doctor told him the only other option is skull surgery. The bones in his head would be drilled out to make room for the nerves in hopes he would be able to work his mouth again, so not a good thing. Eye cream. He is on disability and his house payment is 3/4 of what he makes, so he can&#39;t take care of the medical bills himself otherwise he wouldn&#39;t worry about it. It is very depressing. His medical doctor said he hadn&#39;t seen any cases of Bell&#39;s Palsy for 2 years, and he has seen 4 in the last week so that doesn&#39;t give him a lot of confidence even though he is still encouraging people to get the vaccine because it is safer than not.He has multiple visits to the ER 3 times between 18MAR2021 and 19MAR2021 within 24 hours; states he was in the ER for hours and hours but no admission. States they did a CT Scan, MRI, CT with contrast and then after that ended up 22 saw ENT who confirmed the fact that Covid Vaccine that gave Bells Palsy and on 22-23 saw his GM again. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None within 4 weeks; states 9 months ago he had a Tetanus Shot. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy, Visual acuity decreased, Eyelid disorder, Orofacial dyskinesia, numbness in face was not recovered; other events was recovering. All events happened on 18Mar2021.

No c/o fever, headache, body aches.   Patient went to the urgent care for the first time and they prescribed him Acyclovir &#43; Prednisone and symptoms subsided. Then he went to the beach and symptoms came back and then he went back to the urgent care for the 2nd time when the symptoms came back and they prescribed him Valcyclovir 1gm BID &#43; Vaseline for the dryness around mouth. PCP informed patient to go see a dermatologist- he is scheduled to see the dermatologist in 6 weeks.  As of 4/12/21 patient does sees improvement in symptoms. I advised him to continue with the Valcyclovir and  Vaseline and stay out of the sun. Informed him if he gets worse then contact PCP or Dermatologist.

Took aspirin and went to bed at 7pm.  Woke at 8am Friday with mild headache an very tired, by 10am was back in bed, slept 4 hours, Repeated the Friday pattern for 2 more days. Monday the extreme tiredness and arm pain abated. Tuesday, the paranoia abated. Now just Brain Fogged.

                                                Left arm, shoulder, and upper body severe pain. I couldn&#39;t lift my left arm. It felt as if I had the flu. Body aches, disorientation, difficulty breathing, severe body weakness, nose running. I used 8hr Tylenol for the pain. I was restless and couldn&#39;t sleep Friday and Saturday night. On Sunday, the symptoms began to subside, but the general weakness and disorientation remained.

I told him it could potentially be but I have never had anyone report such adverse event. I told him I would report it and recommended he follow up with a prescribing doctor since his pain was so severe. VAERS report completed 05/05/21 on same patient  but patient called back 05/06/21 for update so new VAERS submitted.   update:   reported he had a shingles type reaction over his back and whole torso.

I have been using conservative treatments  at home, everyday for 2 weeks.  ice, heat, over the counter anti-inflammatory meds. The adverse condition persists. To date, I have not sought medical attention from a orthopedic specialist but have an upcoming appointment scheduled. I do not know for sure if the covid vaccine has caused a flare-up of inflammation in an old Achilles? tendon injury but it does seem quite coincidental that having had no pain or problems with my old injury from 12 years ago, that two day after receiving the covid-19 vaccine, I have swollen inflammation in my tendon causing great difficulty in walking.
