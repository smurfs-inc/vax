                                                Starting 2-3 days after the day I got the Pfizer vaccine, I had itchiness on my upper chest as well as my neck and upper back. On December, 26th, I looked in a mirror and realized I had red dots on my upper chest, upper back, and neck. Over the next two days (the 27th and 28th) the red dots extended to my stomach, lower back, and shoulders. Up until today, the dots have extended to my upper arms, forearms, hands, and legs. I went to employee health to speak to two nurses who agreed I should report this as a potential allergy to Pfizer&#39;s vaccine. I am nervous about taking the second dose but am planning on doing so. I have taken Benadryl and applied hydrocortisone cream on the affected areas. I have a medrol dose pack prescription that I will fill if my symptoms get worse. I do not have trouble breathing, but I am constantly itchy each day.

This rash appeared within a week or so of getting the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Over the next few weeks the rash slowly faded (not completely, though). When I woke up the morning after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the rash doubled in coverage in the same areas of my body.   Around the time the rash showed up, I also began experiencing lower to mid-back pain, which grew more severe over time. The back pain is worst in the morning after sleeping, or after sitting/resting for longer periods of time. I&#39;ve been taking Ibuprofen and Aleve, which helps, as does being active. The back pain did not noticeably worsen after the second dose, but it is just as severe.   Currently, the rash has faded (not completely), and my back pain is still quite bothersome.

A 26-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9266) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 21Feb2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 26-years-old) as a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, weakened immune system, and allergy to loratadine (CLARITIN). Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) as needed and fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR 500/50). On 21Feb2021 at 14:15, the patient experienced headache, tiredness and was feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine. The next day, on 22Feb2021, the patient experienced significant soreness at injection site. The patient was not treated for headache, tiredness, feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine, and significant soreness at injection site. The clinical outcome of headache, tiredness, feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine, and significant soreness at injection site was recovering.

                                                Approximately 57 hours after receiving 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine, I developed hive patches throughout my body. I took 50 mg Benadryl and went to bed. Work up the next morning to observe some res spots, but minimal itching. I reported to work, where I am an EMT for an ambulance service. During shift, at approximately 1500 hours, I had a patient who was cold, so I cranked up the heat in the back of the ambulance. I started to sweat. My hive then came back with a vengeance all over my body. I immediately took 50 mg Benadryl and went to the urgent care center. The doctor told me to continue with the Benadryl and to pick up a prescription of Prednisone if symptoms worsen. Symptoms where mostly cleared up at that point. I got off shift at 1900. Hive worsened at approximately 2000. I picked up the prednisone and intend to begin taking it in the morning if symptoms are not much improved.

                                                Pt. was vaccinated by another pharmacist at our remote clinic at an elementary school at 11:35am 3/11/21. Within less than 3 minutes the patient informed a student  that he did not feel well. He reported: itching, feeling hot, shortness of breath, dizziness, loss of vision, and thirst. The student alerted me and I assessed the pt. He was responsive, but felt &#34;tired&#34;. He was sitting on the floor. I told the student to call 911. I continued talking with the pt. as I was preparing the epinephrine and placing a blood pressure cuff on his arm. He became less responsive and asked me for the epinephrine. I injected him with an EpiPen 0.3mg in his outer left thigh through his pants (at 11:43am). Within approximately 30s-1min the pt. became more responsive. I then took his pulse and BP shortly before EMS arrived (11:52am) . They performed the second blood pressure reading and the pt. was transferred to their care at that point.

Nothing serious until I fell asleep, which is when I developed a fever, uncontrollable chills, and aches all over my body, so much that I could not sleep until I took some ibuprofen. In the morning, the chills were gone, but a slight fever and body aches remained all day. They were gone by the next day.

A 28-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EK5730), intramuscularly on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization because he work in a hospital. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported to have been vaccinated last Wednesday and developed symptoms on Thursday (24Dec2020) with a pretty bad chills, body ache, headache, itchiness, then got sort of better and that was on Thursday. He felt better on Friday (25Dec2020) but reported a really bad runny nose and congestion, he started to develop sinus like symptoms like runny nose, like sinus congestion and that&#39;s so something that he was experiencing like 26Dec2020 to Saturday. The patient was asking if these were the typical symptoms/ normal reaction to the vaccine and if he had that reaction were normal and how long would they usually last. The outcome of chills, headache, itchiness was recovering, of the other events was unknown.

I also had back pain, muscle pain, headaches, continued fever (improved with motrin) and chills. My left arm from my shoulder to my wrist was with noted pain/aches, improved with motrin. On the morning of 1/9 I felt much better, did not take any motrin/tylenol and without any fever/chills.  Noted improvement of muscle aches in general and arm felt  the same as 1/7 (much better!).  Noted lymph swelling of my axillary lymph nodes with aching pain.  This has not gone away at current but improved with x1 dose of motrin.

                                                At around 1:30 in the morning, i became really weak, achey, had the chills, some nausea, a minor headache, a slight sore throat, and  minor eye pain like they were dry. Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

A few days later I noticed some red bumps on my stomach and back area only. The bumps seem to be staying the same, they do not itch and are not in any kind of specific pattern. I do not have any other major symptoms. The rash is not painful, not hot, and i do not believe it was due to anything else.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

                                                2 days after the vaccination I developed a rash in the lower back and on the left and right shoulder and was really itchy.  It came and went for a couple hours and the next day it got worse which made me reach out and have a virtual visit and was advised to take benedry which did help.  The rash appeared as a hive.

Dose 2 on 01/05- Sore arm near vaccination site at 12 hours. At 15 hours out woke up in middle of the night with diffuse body aches and chills. These progressively worsened. Fatigue also present in the morning with very mild fever.  Developed nausea the next day as well. At 36 hours out body aches were improving but a headache developed at ~ 30 hours out. Next morning 2 days out the only thing thing that persisted was fatigue. This was gone another 12 hours later.  No persistent symptoms.

Rash extends on anterior arm up to axilla. Rash also present in inguinal area and 100% of buttocks and extends down posterior leg down to knee. Petechiae present bilaterally on ventral hands hand finger tips (likely related to squeezing hands for itch relief)  Rash was present around 60 hours after vaccination starting on buttocks and inguinal area and progressed to hands then armpits over the following day. Rash progressing in severity despite 50 mg oral Benadryl q6h, 40 mg oral prednisone daily, and topical hydrocortisone. Rash still present and progressing and no peak severity has been identified yet.

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

                                                11pm on day of (Sunday) vaccination felt soreness in left arm at injection site and in entire upper arm when trying to hold it up. Soreness subsided by noon the next day, Monday. No symptoms on Tuesday until late evening when tongue began to feel sore. On Wednesday morning around 6am, woke up with severe body fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea, headache. Hands and fingers very cold to the touch. Severe fatigue and weakness all day. Sore tongue persisted. No respiratory symptoms present. By Thursday (today), body is still feverish, joint and muscle aches persist, light headache at times. Still fatigued and weak. All symptoms today Thursday are much weaker except for the muscle and joint pain which remains high.  The reason I am reporting this is that from what I&#39;ve read and been told, the delayed onset of these symptoms (almost 3 days) is very unusual, especially because I had little/no symptoms in the first 2 days of the vaccine.

                                                more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine; Purple splotches; Dizzy and woozy; Nausea; Headache; Feels awful/slow motion; Tired; Sluggish; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22Mar2021 at 12:30 at the age of 30 years-old, (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included dyspepsia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Severe Heartburn , blood pressure measurement from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Blood pressure , migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for blood pressure for 3 years and ongoing; pantoprazole (PANTOPRAZOLE) taken for stomach medication and heartburn for about a year. Patient states he got the first round 3 weeks ago and he is supposed to get the second dose next Monday but was advised by his doctor not to do that.      Patient states he got the shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and Tuesday 23Mar2021 he was tired and sluggish. On Wednesday 24Mar2021, mid afternoon, he had purple splotches all over his body, in arms and legs, like discoloration, his head felt like it had been dipped in cement and he couldn&#39;t think. States he felt cloudy, dizzy and woozy, nauseous, had a headache and feeling awful. States this occurred like 48 hours after the shot. He contacted a life long friend who is a doctor and works in a covid ward and he told him he was having a reaction and to take some Benadryl and Advil or Tylenol, and the friend told the patient to lay down and rest. He still didn&#39;t feel great but splotches went away and head felt a little bit clearer and he didn&#39;t feel like he was in slow motion or dizzy anymore by Wednesday evening, so he went to bed. On Thursday, the patient went into work but didn&#39;t feel great, not feeling 100%, and about noon on Thursday 25Mar2021, the symptoms started coming back, the purple splotches, his head felt just as bad, he had a headache, slow motion and not himself. The patient called his doctor and his friend and they said he needed to go in and get looked at. The patient tried to go into an urgent care and he states they said nope head to the ER. Patient states he was admitted into the ER and the ER staff said he was having more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave him steroids and an IV but he is not sure what it is and he was given, he thinks, Prednisone over the next couple days to help with side effects, he believes it was Prednisone, he knows it was a steroid. States he is not a fan of it and he doesn&#39;t like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it. Patient states he still gets headaches and maybe it&#39;s something else that is unrelated. States he stopped feeling tired and sluggish maybe the 29Mar2021, a week afterwards. Patient states that he has recovered with lasting effects as he&#39;s been getting migraines since then, states maybe it&#39;s unrelated but didn&#39;t happen a whole lot before. He has severe headaches and nothing he takes seems to help, has to turn lights off and works from home and patient reports that he had one yesterday. Patient states the purple splotches went away after he went to the ER and got on the medicine, the steroids.  P atient states the nausea was pretty constant when a headache comes on, he doesn&#39;t have a headache every day but when he gets a headache he is definitely nauseous.  The outcome of the events was for fatigue and sluggish, recovered with sequela, Purple splotches, dizzy and woozy slow motion, recovered, nausea and headache not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Woke up at 1:00 am with severe chills.  Lasted 2 hours.  -Threw on sweats and another blanket, went back to sleep. 3. Woke up at 6:30 am with intense body and head pain.  &#34;was a cant get comfortable in any position type of pulsing pain&#34; Something im accustomed to when i get the Flu.  I rolled around in pain for 4 hours while trying to go back to sleep; it even hurt to breathe deeply. - took Tylenol at 11am and the symptoms never came back.  *Note.  I think i suffered so much pain in the 4 hours that it lasted with me until even now as i write this.  Hard to describe, but my entire body has had this tiny ache that has not gone away.  Not a big deal to me, but just wanted it documented.  I am selecting recovered even with that tiny ache still apparent because physical pain usually takes time to heal.  Assuming that&#39;s all it is.

A 31-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730 and expiry date: 31Mar2021), Subcutaneously on 29Dec2020 at 16:40 at single dose at Left Deltoid at Hospital for Prevention. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history, and no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient wanted to know what the recommendations are if the COVID Vaccine was administered subcutaneously. He clarified he received the COVID Vaccine, but he believed it was administered via sub cutaneous with a half inch needle on 29Dec2020 at 16:40. He knew with other vaccines such as the Flu Vaccine, if it is not given intramuscularly, a patient is subject to revaccination. The patient wanted to know if he needs to be revaccinated with the COVID Vaccine since it wasn&#39;t an intramuscular injection. Relevant Tests were None. On 01Jan2021, the patient stated that he had started developing a red bruise like the bubbles on his arm; it seemed more like under the skin there was a bubble and not like inflammatory muscles. The patient reported that the shot was given with the half inch of needle because it was only recommended with the one inch or larger; so actually, he was trying to find it on the mail. The question he wanted to ask was if it went to the deep muscle enough or possibly into the tissue. But over the last, like 24 hours, he has started developing a red bruise like the bubbles on his arm. It didn&#39;t feel like he ever had any muscle pain or anything and it seemed more like under the skin there was a bubble and not like inflammatory muscles. The patient&#39;s weight was reported as 104.33 kg or 230 pounds. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown. Causality between the event &#34;I have start developing a red bruise like the bubbles on my arm; it seems more like under skin there is a bubble and not like inflammatory muscles&#34; and BNT162B2 was reported as related.  Follow-up (01Jan2021): New information received from a contactable pharmacist includes additional events (contusion, blister), an additional laboratory data, and the clinical course of the events.

                                                I had soreness around my arm of injection site for about 3  days.    I also wanted to let you all know that I had a sore throat that started the day after my first dose.  Sore throat started off as mild but later got worse by the 2nd day.  I also experienced a mild grade fever, headaches, and chills which went away in a couple of days.  HOWEVER, today (1-14-2021) I decided to rule out the possibility of me having COVID.  So I got tested for covid and I was tested positive via the RT-PCR at a local urgent care facility.    So with that being said I am not quite sure if the sore throat, mild grade fever, headaches, and chills were part because of the vaccine dose (first dose)  or it could have been from  experiencing covid symptoms.    Treatment I used were drinking LOTS of water, Tylenolol and Advil, Cephacol lozenges,  and sleep.

                                                Within 2-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy.  I signaled for help while in my car  and help arrived. Within the next few minutes the severity seemed to go from ?0-100? and I began to feel a deep impending sense of doom and panic/fear. I also felt extremely tense in my muscles and felt itchy in the chest area. That continued for 15 minutes or so before subsiding slowly. Staff surrounded my car and were very supportive and great about the situation.   It was one of the most frightening experiences to date I have had. No EpiPen type intervention was done. Once the event was on the downswing I was kept for additional observation and release on my own accord.  Everyone there was great. I am reporting for my own records in case further testing reveals I have an allergy to this vaccine for employment purposes should the vaccine become mandated prior to me having alternative means of vaccination or allergy testing competed to determine if it was an true reaction or not so I can get vaccinated safely.

Probably a total of eight small red dots size of a little bigger of a pen tip. Appear to be blood pooling. They were in a straight line that seemed to outline the Band-Aid so it really stood out as strange. No pain nothing else going on. Just kind of a weird sight.

I waited a few days and then on Feb 24th went to an clinic to receive a steroid cream which mostly resolved that. However, the rash/hives continued to spread across my body and are now on my sides, chest, back, arms and neck. I went to the clinic and received a steroid pack. The consensus from my clinic was that this was likely a reaction to the vaccine -

Woke up the next day with mild to severe body aches, muscle soreness, joint pain and pain in my stomach/abdomen. Developed a 101 fever 24 hrs after receiving the vaccine, and continued until this morning (3/16). Vomiting multiple times in the middle of the night on 3/14. The vomiting was only a one night deal, but every other symptom that I experienced has been persistent until this morning. I feel about 80% back at the moment. Symptoms were very similar, maybe even a little more extreme, than the ones I experienced when I contracted Covid months ago, but they didn?t last as long.

A 31-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID VACCINE; lot number: EL9262; expiration date: unknown) at 31-year-old vaccination age via an unspecified route of administration in the right deltoid on 18Feb2021 9:00 AM as a single dose to protect self (covid-19 immunization). Medical history included chicken pox virus as a kid and shingles. The patient has no family medical history. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccination included varicella zoster vaccine (CHICKENPOX VACCINE) for vaccination for chicken pox and received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID VACCINE; lot number: EL3246) at unknown vaccination age via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on an unspecified date as a single dose to protect self (covid-19 immunization). The patient received the vaccine in a hospital and did not receive other vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported that he just got a flare up of shingles on 28Feb2021 and doesn&#39;t know if it is related or not to the covid vaccination he took. The patient reported that he did nothing unusual in the last 14 days. Doesn&#39;t know if that is something to report to see if there was any trending. The patient inquired if a shingles flare-up has happened before after the COVID vaccine. He got the vaccine ten days before (18Feb2021) the shingles flare up started. He added that it is on right side of torso in the thorax area and goes from midline abdomen all the way to midline on his back on the right side. The adverse event required urgent care visit (emergency room visit). The nurse considered the event serious. The patient did not have relevant tests and was only clinically diagnosed with a shingles flare up. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug to the reported event &#34;Shingles flare up&#34; cannot be completely excluded based on temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identifies as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notifies to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                When the needle entered my arm, that felt normal. But I felt extreme pressure and immediate pain as soon as the plunger got depressed. After the needle was removed, I continued to feel pain within my shoulder, not at the injection site.  On my ride home, the pain started to worsen and was very painful when I got home, throughout my shoulder joint.  I took Advil when I got home, and have taken it very 6 hours since, along with lots of water.  I have used a heating pad with some immediate relief but no improvement in the pain.  I am trying to stretch and move the arm, but am requiring assistance with even that because of how much pain is involved with simple movements.  It does not seem nerve related as it does not radiate down my arm.  The pain is isolated to my shoulder joint.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

                                                In addition to achiness, I have experienced a numb sensation at the injection site and the entire deltoid muscle that extended towards the elbow. The numbness lasted at least an hour after the injection and a couple of times over the past three days. I have experienced a mild fever (99.8 F) each day since the vaccination, but only in the mornings or late at night. I treated this by taking Tylenol.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes; Developed Shingles on his face; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional. This other healthcare professional reported for a 32-year-old male patient (her fiance). A 32-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

There were no investigation assessment. The patient had not recovered from the events at the time of the report.    Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the Company considers the event swollen lymph nodes is possibly related to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. Other than a temporal association, there is no evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the event shingles, which is likely an intercurrent condition. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About two weeks after first shot, I got shingles. It could be unrelated, but since I&#39;m young, perfectly healthy, not abnormally stressed, and haven&#39;t ever had singles before, I thought there might be a chance it is related. I&#39;ve seen online other young people who are saying that they got shingles after the first shot of Moderna or Pfizer.  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I figured it was worth reporting. It is overall a pretty mild case because I got on the antiviral drugs pretty quickly. Wondering if I should still get my second shot on schedule or wait until my shingles is all cleared. I have asked my doctor and am awaiting a response. I first noticed the symptoms on Saturday (3/20) exactly two weeks after my first shot.

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

A 33-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose on right arm, mid bicep for COVID-19 immunization. There were no patient history. Concomitant medications included hepatitis b vaccine on 14Dec2020, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]), calcium and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number:EK5730) on 18Dec2020 (left arm) and he experienced little pain around the injection site, some nausea and some bouts of dizziness. The patient received the Covid 19 Vaccine 4 days after receiving the Hepatitis B vaccination, so he identified this as an error in administration. So the Hepatitis B vaccination was given on 14Dec2020 and the first Covid 19 Vaccine was given on 18Dec2020. He received the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that originally the prescriber who administered it the first two doses had scheduled him to receive the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine as the same day as his second Hepatitis B Vaccination and he identified this error last Wednesday and stated &#34;I believe or potentially today, I&#39;m not sure which one I&#39;m sorry I had to check with that&#34;. So, he was trying to get this all cleared up. He did report symptoms for both Covid Vaccines as little pain around the injection site, some nausea, some bouts of dizziness. So, patient had already discussed the common adverse reactions with him. Patient was told that co-administration has not been studied yet and referred him to his HCP for continued guidance on how and when to space out the additional Hepatitis B vaccination that he will need. Patient was &#34;32&#34; back in December when this happened. He had his birthday and turned 33. Second shot for the Covid was scheduled the same day the Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) but due to inveigle in-charge of the vaccine, he had lost his paper work and he had been on vacation and stated &#34;had been vaccine was not found they just gave me the second Covid Vaccine and told me to come back by Thursday and I should have found it and have everything cleared up by then but then Wednesday they called me and told me that they have realized that they are not supposed to give vaccine co-administered with 14 days window before or after. I haven&#39;t got my second Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) just the first one was administered within the 4 days period of the first shot&#34;. Patient work at Dietary Providence. The patient had his blood drawn this morning (20Jan2021). Patient does not have product details for hepatitis B vaccine. Patient stated that the nurse on duty had said that the vaccine they had stocks was &#34;Engerix-B hepatitis B recombinant&#34; but that was not verified as far as definitively is just what she had stocked when he was going on his incident report. Patient further stated, &#34;As far as all things are concerned you know I went to a doctor got checked he said breathing was great, heart rate was great, oxygen level 98 percent, he has drawn blood by then is there anything that I should be doing at this point cataloging thing any other test any other people to contact. What should I do going forward specially what can I do to be helpful for you guys to get this situation clear.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 33-year-old patient (husband) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 05Apr2021 15:40 (Lot Number: ER8734) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atopic dermatitis. Concomitant medication included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), an injection that patient takes every other week to control his atopic dermatitis, he has been using this for 3 years at least. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER6207) in left shoulder on 15Mar2021 15:40, at the age of 32 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, and experienced arm sore and body aches. The patient experienced vomiting blood in Apr2021, blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up / spitting up blood in Apr2021, he feels like his throat is so raw on 05Apr2021, sore arm on 05Apr2021, feeling achy/ her husband is still sore/achy today on 05Apr2021, nauseous on 05Apr2021, vomiting/ throwing up on 05Apr2021, diarrhea on 05Apr2021, chilly in Apr2021, redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids; his pores looked red in Apr2021, fatigue on 05Apr2021. No treatment received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events pain in arm, ache, nauseous, erythema, fatigue was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Clinical course as reported: Her husband got their second dose of the vaccine on 05Apr2021. Her husband was having a more severe reaction than the first time. The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller&#39;s husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o&#39;clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn&#39;t like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid. Wife added what she was trying to see was if she should take her husband to the hospital or not. She did not want to wait too long, but if this was something that was a side effect that was expected, then her husband could just sleep it off.

The Tylenol didn&#39;t help at all, ibuprofen 200mg didn&#39;t do much. Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot.

                                                At onset, rash covering upper portion of chest, mildly itchy. Over the following approximately 48 hours, the rash spread progressively down torso to waist. After reaching waist on front of body, it continued at top of back and moved down progressively to shoulder blades. When it reached this point, it was still present everywhere it had already appeared. After the approximately 48 hours of spreading, it retreated in the reverse progression over the course of about 72 hours. So it gradually cleared on the back, then cleared on front of torso starting at waist and cleared gradually moving up the torso.  No medication was taken at any time to treat the rash or any other condition/illness.  Waited until 2nd vaccine dose to ask vaccine clinic if I could treat it if it reoccurs. They suggested Benadryl unless it becomes more serious than what was described to them.

                                                Left arm was incapacitated for nearly a week after the initial injection. Arm could not be lifted more than a few inches away from torso, and pain felt like severe deep cramping constantly. No bruising or mark at the site of the injection just severe muscle pain that affected all movement and sleep.  After one week I regained more mobility but still had severe pain in the shoulder muscles around injection site. At the 3 week mark I have more mobility but still struggle with a full range of motion and lifting anything more than a few pounds.

                                                I started noticing itching a week after the vaccine. I had painful lesions on my armpit, on my back underneath my shoulder blade and on my buttock. The lesions were very painful. I was diagnosed with Shingles two weeks after the first dose of the vaccine. I had to delay the second dose because I was taking the medicine for the Shingles. The Shingles cleared up a week after I started the medication. I was also exposed to Covid-19 during that time but tested negative. I also have a lingering achy feeling in the back of my throat over the last couple of months. It is an uncomfortable feeling.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

No associated fever or systemic symptoms.  My daughter did have a febrile illness 2 days prior to the development of my rash.

                                                Employee got COVID vaccine to right arm 12/21/2020. He noticed a rash to his right arm on the night of 12/27/2020. The rash was red and raised, he didn&#39;t think anything of it at the time. The rash persisted and was growing in a linear fashion and seemed to have an unusual appearance. He scheduled a telehealth visit with a Hospital Urgent Care on 12/31/2020. At this time he was diagnosed with Shingles and started on an antiviral. Multiple providers on the telehealth visit think that Shingles is a reaction to the Covid vaccine, as he is otherwise healthy and young and had recently gotten the vaccine. His symptoms are improving and he will be on antivirals for a week total. He denies other symptoms or concerns at this time.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

                                                Started with tingling of the tongue and itchiness of the arms. I took 50mg of Benadryl immediately, but then progressed to hives all over on my, arms, trunk, eyes, ears, and scalp, and legs. Went to the emergency room in case it got worse or obstructed my breathing. In the ER continued to have itching and extreme redness of my arms, with some swelling of my arms as well. About an hour later the Benadryl began working and received prednisone and Pepcid. Stayed in the ER for another hour and my symptoms mostly resolved. Was prescribed 3 days of 40mg prednisone and given an epipen. Have not had issues since then.

He went to the emergency room and was treated with Benadryl and steroids. The following morning he continued to have skin pruritus and developed a few skin lesions. He was also fatigued and had some shortness of breath with exertion. He had Allegra in the home so he was encouraged to take it and  also had been prescribed Benadryl which he could take as needed.

On 1/14 the right half of my lower lip swelled up and would continue to do so until 1/15 around about 0730 after taking a benadryl.   Symptoms and issues seem to happen sporadically without a pattern or warning.

                                                24 hr after vaccine, I had fatigue and generalized body aches and left arm pain at site of injection. I took tylenol.  Those stopped by the second day morning (day after vaccine). However, in the second morning ( day after vaccine) I started having pain on left side of neck and on Trapezius muscle on left shoulder blade - and had that pain for three more days. Range of motion for neck restricted for three days. All symptoms improved after four days. I took Lidocaine patch and Tylenol for neck and shoulder blade pain.

For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

A 35-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via intramuscular on the left arm, on 21Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. No history of allergic reactions to any meds (medication) in the past or other vaccines in childhood. Otherwise young healthy male with no history of hypertension. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1686) via intramuscular on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 16:00 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe elevation of blood pressure. On 22Jan2021, at 12:00 AM, after the 2nd dose in left arm, after about 24 to 48 hours, the patient experienced vesicular pruritic erythematous patches in multiple locations of my left arm, left arm pit, left upper back, left chest occurred, peaking on day three and still remain after one week. The blisters have opened leaving behind painful ulcers. This is not a rash that disappears in a few days. It will take much longer than that to heal. No rash with the first dose. Also, with both doses, had severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100 within 2 to 5 hours on 22Jan2021, requiring about 3 doses of clonidine over 7 days where bp would cycle up and down. The seriousness of the events was reported as non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has been not tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events and included Benadryl, mometasone cream and clonidine. The outcome of the events was reported as recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Couldn&#39;t abduct arm for about 24 hours due to pain.  Very faint red rash a few inches below injection site that goes across arm.  Arm is moderately itchy and has been since Monday 1/18/21.

Everything is in the middle of the upper arm.  The itchiness and prolonged soreness are my concerns, considering I still need a 2nd dose.

                                                Day after injection I developed 99.9 elevated temp, headache, nausea, chills, and aches.  That mostly disapated after about fours hours sleep that evening.  The headache lasted most the following week, but was tolerable and minor.  I noticed near end of the week following injection that my injection site began to swell a little and turn red, very similar to a white head.  This has continued to be present now still two weeks following.

Also on my feet and under my armpit.  There are also random hives appearing on different parts of my body.  These symptoms have been happening during daytime hours on 3 separate days so far, starting two days after my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  After taking a cetirizine tablet the rash and hives subside after a couple hours.  Then it starts up again in the morning upon arrival at work.

Woke up morning of 2/19 and observed extensive petechiae and bloody nose consistent with low platelet count and ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). I was previously diagnosed with ITP and platelet count was 262k confirmed by blood work a couple days before 2nd vaccine. Morning after got blood draw confirming platelets dropped to below 1k. Medical emergency and sent to ER. Admitted and received emergency treatment to increase platelet counts. Ended up requiring splenectomy on 2/22/21. Just discharged from hospital. Multiple medical providers advised me to submit report to VAERS.

                                                Stronger pain in area of shot (compared to first dose) Soreness About 14-15 hours after the 2nd dose, I began feeling extremely fatigue. Also developed a slight chills feeling.  At the 21 hour mark, I was exhausted. Felt very weak and stared feeling a little warm. Around hour 22/23, body/bone aches developed.  By 24hrs after the 2nd vaccine, I took 800mg of ibuprofen (to help with the body aches and slight fever) and a Zyrtec for my allergies.  I&#39;m awake and getting ready for work again (I worked through the symptoms yesterday, somehow) approx 34hrs after the 2nd dose. I feel &#34;normal&#34; considering my arm is still sore from the shot. But all other symptoms appear to have subsided; my only tiredness is from waking up early for work.

First night, it was very difficult to sleep - I did not get much. Dizziness was like being very drunk. Now every night laying down in bed looking up is dizzying, some nights worse than others but not as bad as first night of symptoms. This has been persistent for about a week. Some temporary dizziness when reorienting head quickly during the day, particularly looking up or down, but mainly worse at night in the dark, not debilitating. Sleeping with some low lights on helps reduce spinning feeling. Mild headache and tight neck/shoulders starting 9 days after injection but may be unrelated.

A 36-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06Apr2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm from 16Mar2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not diagnose with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was very sick for 4 days: fevers which came and went, chills, sweats, nausea, loss of appetite, light headedness, lack of energy. As a result of his immune system being weakened, he wound up with Cellulitis which he was still fighting over 3 weeks after the shot. As the patient was normally a healthy male, it was strange that he would wind up with a bacterial infection. The patient also stated that after the second dose he experienced cellulitis in his left leg to thigh area. He went to emergency room for scan and to rule out clot. He thought he was immunocompromised and that was why he got the cellulitis in the leg. Caller wanted to get the compensation information to help with the bills. The events onset date was 06Apr2021 17:00. 2 rounds of antibiotics was received for the events. The events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ultrasound with unknown result. The outcome of the events was recovering.

While I was changing, I noticed a diffuse maculopapular rash on my torso back thighs and upper arms.  The rash was very pruritic.  I took some Benadryl which did not seem to help the itchiness and made me sleepy.  By Thursday, most of the rash on the torso was gone, but the rash had spread more to my forearms, lower legs, feet and hands.  There was some mild edema of the hands, I had some mild fatigue, and temperature check was slightly elevated around 99 degrees F.   By Friday, most of the rash was gone and I had some remaining itchiness of feet and hands.  Saturday I was back to normal.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

                                                My son had the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday February 27th. Today, 6 days later, he woke up with a rash all over his body. I suspect the vaccine. I gave him a Xyzal this morning, but did not do anything to diminish the rash. I am not sure if he should get the second dose due March 20th. Have you heard of a delayed rash happening days later and how long this might last? Please let me know or forward to someone who knows.

                                                Patient received first dose of 2-dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  Approximately 24 hours after injection, patient experienced headaches.  Approximately 48-72 hours after injection, patient experienced left eye pain and developed a non-itch-inducing rash in left temple.  Following after this period, eye pain worsened, as did the size of rash (stretching from temple to back of left ear - along the V1 nerve).  Patient was diagnosed with Shingles and is now receiving treatment for that virus.  It is theorized that the vaccine induced an immune response to attack the novel virus, and left its guard down for the dormant Herpes Zoster virus.

He became conscious again quickly in less than about 1 minute.  He was then aware of where he was, date and his name.  EMS responded and took over.

I have never experience this before and the only change in my history was the vaccine. Today I was out in the sun again for 30 minutes with 30SPF on and my entire body got sunburnt today and sun poisoning again after only the 30 minutes in the sun. The only places that are red and itchy are places exposed to the sun.

The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol.

When I came back around 4pm I was feeling okay, no sore on the injection site, unlike my regularly flu vaccines that I mostly feel sore at injection site which lasts about few hours immediately after the flu shot, so it was sort of surprising to see that but later that night, my body starts feeling weak, aches and a tangling on my feet, as the night progresses up to the early morning, I was unusually fatigued and lightheaded with the regression of the muscle aches and subsequently other symptoms started disappearing, notably, I started feeling soreness on the injection site, which lingered to the next day.

A 38-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, lot no. EH9899, expiration date not reported) intramuscular on left arm on 28Dec2020 at a single dose, then second dose (lot no. EK9231, expiry date not reported), intramuscular on right arm on 18Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: penicillin. (no major history of allergic reactions except penicillin as a baby). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that on 11Jan2021 15:00 (03:00 PM) &#34;exactly two weeks after taking the first shot, my body broke out in systematic rash and welts with swelling of face. My doctor thought two weeks was two long of a delay for the reaction to be from the vaccine. My doctor thought it might have been some antibiotics I had been on and they gave me prednisone. The prednisone cleared up the reaction before the second shot. I received the second shot (on 18Jan2021 with lot no. EK9231, intramuscular on right arm) and within two hours I had an even worse systematic allergic reaction that is still on going as of today 04Feb2021. The Prednisone is not clearing up the reaction. I am going to have to take short term disability.&#34; The adverse events resulted to patient had clinic visit, disability or permanent damage. Patient took prednisone, famotidine, hydroxyzine, and XANAX (because of the prednisone) as treatments. The vaccine was given in the hospital. No other vaccines were given in four weeks.  Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported allergic reaction manifested with &#34;systematic rash and welts with swelling of face&#34; and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Next day the muscle aches were all over but not as bad, but a severe headache all day. Treated with tylenol all day along with ibuprofen &#43; tylenol at night. The next day I felt fine, however noticed a baseball sized lump under my left armpit about 60 hours after the shot in my left shoulder. Internet says it&#39;s a swollen lymph node and known side effect. The next morning the swelling went down significantly and after another day it seems to be getting better.

Very big and itchy. I took some Claritin. Those welts continued to grow and spread;  Upper inner arms, flanks, inner thighs.  Continued throughout the night  *took pictures of welts Took some Benadryl at night. Woke up; symptoms still there and extended even more to include hands. I went to work. I wasn&#39;t feeling ill but uncomfortable. Took some more antihistamines. It got worse thru the day. No SOB.  1/12 noon Different kind of rash, petechia in appearance.; shins. My knees, ankles, feet were starting to swell.  Hives had gone from the thighs and up, But below, shins to feet, were swelling.  1/13 I woke up to a lacy rash over all extremities. Bruising on shins. Knees, hands and feet still swollen.  Started Oral steroid. By noon that day, pretty much everything had cleared up. Six day course treatment, no symptoms came back. No fever. No SOB. I did miss work the 1/13 as it was at its worse.

The primary reason i am reporting an adverse effect is that I am still experiencing mild soreness in the shoulder muscle into which the vaccine was injected.  Occasionally, this soreness seems to be present in the other muscles of my upper arm as well.  This mild soreness has persisted and been very consistent ever since the initial moderate soreness from the first injection subsided about 2 months ago.  I have not experienced this type of lingering soreness following any previous vaccination.

                                                I woke up just after midnight scratching furiously my entire body though mostly from the waist down. I noticed breaking out in hives on my legs. I had scratched so hard while sleeping that I broke the skin and was bleeding. Through a combination of benadryl and topical otc lotions the hives went down after 8 hours and gone within 24 hours. I still have moderate itching from the waist down which I never experienced prior to my second shot. I use otc lotion throughout the day and still continue to itch. I will at times use benadryl is the itching gets uncontrolled.

A 38-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP6955, expiration date: 30Jun2021) via an unspecified route of administration in the arm right on 05Apr2021 11:16 AM as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

The patient received his second Covid 19 vaccine on 05Apr2021 and the hives started on 08Apr2021. The patient had hives all over. The hives did get worse overnight. The patient had gotten hives when he was younger but it was a reaction to a plant. The hives he had currently have not gone away even with a shower or taking Benadryl. He took 2 25mg tablets of Benadryl within an hour of each other yesterday, 08Apr2021. Then about 9 hours later he took 2 more 25mg tablets. He was going to sleep so he thought the Benadryl (lot number: SEF004, expiry date: Dec2021) would help with that. The patient had no questions except if her husband needed to go to the doctor. The AEs did not required a visit to Emergency Room, no physician office. The patient had no Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Outcome of the events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

                                                rash on his arm/has grown and was now a little bit itchy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician (patient). A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK5730, expiry date unknown) intramuscular at right arm on 20Dec2020 around 09:30 at single dose for Covid-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient received Covid 19 vaccine 8 days ago (20Dec2020 around 09:30) and 5 days ago (Dec2020) he noticed a rash on his arm. The patient informed that he was not even sure if this was about the COVID-19 vaccine or if he has just associated it with it, but the rash has grown and was now a little bit itchy (Dec2020). The patient clarified that his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine was on 20Dec2020 and he had onset of rash about 23Dec2020 or 24Dec2020, he was not exactly sure. The outcome of the event rash on his arm/has grown and was now a little bit itchy was not recovered. The reporter causality was unknown, with the information he has obtained and the conversation he just had with the inbound transfer agent it seemed a very low, slight likelihood that there was a causality relationship.

                                                A few hours after injection, I began having discomfort in my left shoulder, the location of the injection.  Over the following next few hours I began to have overall body aches and pains in my joints.  My skin became extremely sensitive to the touch, a very strange hard to describe sensation.  I then began to get the chills, and running a fever.  Ultimately my fever spiked at 104 degrees.   I took a cold bath to bring the fever down, and for the rest of the night seesawed back and forth with fever using cold compresses and no sheets on my bed to keep my fever down.  I also took one 200 Mg Ib-Profen.  At roughly 26 hours after the injection, I no longer have a fever, but the body aches persist.

It feels very similar to when a limb falls asleep. There is numbness and tingling feeling .  So far there is no pain or weakness. There has been no treatment.  This started on 1/14/2021 and has continued through today.
