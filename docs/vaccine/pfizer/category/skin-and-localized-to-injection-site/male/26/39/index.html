                                                Starting 2-3 days after the day I got the Pfizer vaccine, I had itchiness on my upper chest as well as my neck and upper back. On December, 26th, I looked in a mirror and realized I had red dots on my upper chest, upper back, and neck. Over the next two days (the 27th and 28th) the red dots extended to my stomach, lower back, and shoulders. Up until today, the dots have extended to my upper arms, forearms, hands, and legs. I went to employee health to speak to two nurses who agreed I should report this as a potential allergy to Pfizer&#39;s vaccine. I am nervous about taking the second dose but am planning on doing so. I have taken Benadryl and applied hydrocortisone cream on the affected areas. I have a medrol dose pack prescription that I will fill if my symptoms get worse. I do not have trouble breathing, but I am constantly itchy each day.

This rash appeared within a week or so of getting the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Over the next few weeks the rash slowly faded (not completely, though). When I woke up the morning after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, the rash doubled in coverage in the same areas of my body.   Around the time the rash showed up, I also began experiencing lower to mid-back pain, which grew more severe over time. The back pain is worst in the morning after sleeping, or after sitting/resting for longer periods of time. I&#39;ve been taking Ibuprofen and Aleve, which helps, as does being active. The back pain did not noticeably worsen after the second dose, but it is just as severe.   Currently, the rash has faded (not completely), and my back pain is still quite bothersome.

A 26-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9266) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 21Feb2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 26-years-old) as a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, weakened immune system, and allergy to loratadine (CLARITIN). Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) as needed and fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR 500/50). On 21Feb2021 at 14:15, the patient experienced headache, tiredness and was feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine. The next day, on 22Feb2021, the patient experienced significant soreness at injection site. The patient was not treated for headache, tiredness, feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine, and significant soreness at injection site. The clinical outcome of headache, tiredness, feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine, and significant soreness at injection site was recovering.

The Pharmacy intern noticed that the color of his skin was like a purple and he was passed out. When she started to approach him he started slowly moving his head and adjusting his eyes. He said he felt really dizzy and we had him lay down. He was very sweaty and was shaking a little bit. I took his blood pressure at 11:53 and it was approximately 124/93. He was responsive but feeling dizzy and warm and I stayed with him until the paramedics arrived at about 11:54

                                                A few days after my vaccine i was sitting in a chair and touched my calf and noticed that it was numb. It wasnt pins and needles as if it had fallen asleep. It just had significantly decreased sensitivity. I stood up and walked around to try to fix this but the symptoms persisted for at least 36 hours before subsiding to a much lesser but still present degree of numbness. I went to my doctor and they told me that it was not an emergency aince there was no pain and it caused no weakness. This is localized to the skin on my outer left calf. He said this can be caused by crossing your legs too much but i dont ever do that. 3 weeks later and i still have muted sensations in my left calf. It mostly goes unnoticed until i go to scrub my leg in the shower or something and notice that the scrubber feels significantly different on each leg. The left side feels like &#34;static&#34;.

                                                Initial event was hives that didn&#39;t itch appearing on elbows, they continued to spread for about a day. The doctor said to start Zyrtec, pepcid and ibuprofen. Hours later vomiting, diarrhea, and a blackout followed along with a fever of 102. This time ER gave IV fluids, acetaminophen, ketorolac, ondansetron, and sodium chloride .9%. At this time no mention or notice was made of the hives previously looked at. After this Zyrtec, Pepcid and acetaminophen were being taken regularly. Throughout the rest of that day the hives got worse along with pretty severe angioedema. Also, a feeling of swollowing around a lump in my throat. No change through the night into next day (Friday) for the hives,swelling and lump feeling in throat. Went to walk in clinic where I was prescribed prednisone tapered for 16 days. After the first day of steroids not much change. After 2 there was some improvement. As of today one week after receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine approximately 90% of the hives are gone, only mild swelling and some muscle fatigue and pain left.

Before getting the covid shot, I had had poision ivy for about 10 days. On the second day after receiving second shot of pfizer, I had a secondary rash occur that surrounded the poison ivy rash. There was a noticeable difference in that the covid rash appeared to come from within the body rather than the poison ivy rash that looked and felt as a more external rash.   The symptoms aside from additional rash was when I would move around and generated any type of body heat the &#34;covid rash&#34; would begin to severely itch and irritate. Additionally, If I would go for walks, the area on my leg that still had the poison ivy rash along with the covid rash would not only itch but burn. It created the sensation that a lighter was being held to my skin. It was quite painful.  The other small areas that had the mix of poison ivy and covid rash were not as painful when I was moving around/ walking like the bigger afflicted area.

I still see a few bumps, but it seems to be healing. I didn&#39;t do anything differently in my daily routine; nothing changed (ie: same soap, same detergent, no contact with dust or etcetera). The tattoo also contains phosphorus, which might be related to the reaction.  The muscle aches and cramps are still ongoing; which is weird considering how I never get either and my daily activities haven&#39;t changed.

Chief complaints on admission included excessive fatigue, nuchal rigidty, fevers, and, headache, and some confusion. He also had a rash on his L forehead 2 weeks prior to admission that resolved after taking ibuprofen, however this is unlikely to have treated this rash.   With the working diagnosis of meningitis/enecephalitis, the patient received Acyclovir (4/18?4/21), ampicillin (4/19), ceftriaxone (4/18?4/22), and vancomycin (4/18?4/19) initiated. All labs (will document below) and patient was discharged on a 14 days course of doxycycline 100mg PO BID to cover empirically for possible Lyme meningitis vs. Leptospirosis.   On outpatient follow-up visits, patient reported appropriate adherence to doxycycline, no sick contacts, no further rashes, no fevers, chills, headaches, photophobia/phonophobia, etc.  Does not seem to have any lasting sequelae from &#34;meningitis-like illness.&#34;

                                                Approximately 57 hours after receiving 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine, I developed hive patches throughout my body. I took 50 mg Benadryl and went to bed. Work up the next morning to observe some res spots, but minimal itching. I reported to work, where I am an EMT for an ambulance service. During shift, at approximately 1500 hours, I had a patient who was cold, so I cranked up the heat in the back of the ambulance. I started to sweat. My hive then came back with a vengeance all over my body. I immediately took 50 mg Benadryl and went to the urgent care center. The doctor told me to continue with the Benadryl and to pick up a prescription of Prednisone if symptoms worsen. Symptoms where mostly cleared up at that point. I got off shift at 1900. Hive worsened at approximately 2000. I picked up the prednisone and intend to begin taking it in the morning if symptoms are not much improved.

                                                1-2 hours following vaccine administration, I experienced moderate injection site pain that limited my mobility with that arm (i.e. pain on shoulder abduction). 18 hours following vaccine administration, I experienced a fever and chills (beginning at 0530 the morning after the vaccine). For the rest of the day, I had mild myalgia, a mild to moderate headache and general malaise that resolved by the following morning (within 48 hours of vaccine administration)

                                                Pt. was vaccinated by another pharmacist at our remote clinic at an elementary school at 11:35am 3/11/21. Within less than 3 minutes the patient informed a student  that he did not feel well. He reported: itching, feeling hot, shortness of breath, dizziness, loss of vision, and thirst. The student alerted me and I assessed the pt. He was responsive, but felt &#34;tired&#34;. He was sitting on the floor. I told the student to call 911. I continued talking with the pt. as I was preparing the epinephrine and placing a blood pressure cuff on his arm. He became less responsive and asked me for the epinephrine. I injected him with an EpiPen 0.3mg in his outer left thigh through his pants (at 11:43am). Within approximately 30s-1min the pt. became more responsive. I then took his pulse and BP shortly before EMS arrived (11:52am) . They performed the second blood pressure reading and the pt. was transferred to their care at that point.

The largest patch was on my right shoulder. I took a dose of Cetirizne, and went to the Emergency Room, as the hives were still spreading. I was examined and given 25 mg Benadryl and 60 mg Prednisone. I was told to take 25mg Benadryl every 8 hours, and 40 mg Prednisone every morning for the next three days. By midnight the hives were less itchy and a more dull red color. On 4/4/2021 the hives were reduced, and significantly less itchy. On 4/5/2021 at 10:00 AM the Hives had spread to bright red patches on the lower legs/tops of feet. Still have on more day of Prednisone to take.

Patient was tended to by the NP on duty, instructed to lie down and drink water while she tended to his cut. Patient mentioned it &#34;tasted like he threw up&#34; and still felt lightheaded after 15 minutes after the event. Patient was insistent that we should not call the squad as he does not have insurance. Patient in the meantime was trying to get ahold of a friend or family member to pick him up as we advised him that he could not leave in this state. We elected to call the squad as he had not recovered yet. Before the squad could come, the patients brother showed up and quickly whisked him away. Squad did show up but there was nothing to attend to so left without intervention.

I then got itchy eyes, had some wheezing, and sneezed/got a runny nose. About a half hour after getting these symptoms, I took 10mg of children?s Benadryl (Diphenhydramine). I then found two hives/itchy bumps. One on my right arm near my elbow and one on the left side of my abdomen. About 20 minutes after taking the Benadryl, the symptoms mostly went away and I felt very tired. I still have some wheezing.

I have been on birth control on and off for many years due to irregular and heavy periods. As such, I have not had a period in years. There was significant clotting and heavy flow associated with the period which lasted about 4 days before subsiding. No other adverse effects aside from muscle pain at injection site.

A 28-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EK5730), intramuscularly on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization because he work in a hospital. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported to have been vaccinated last Wednesday and developed symptoms on Thursday (24Dec2020) with a pretty bad chills, body ache, headache, itchiness, then got sort of better and that was on Thursday. He felt better on Friday (25Dec2020) but reported a really bad runny nose and congestion, he started to develop sinus like symptoms like runny nose, like sinus congestion and that&#39;s so something that he was experiencing like 26Dec2020 to Saturday. The patient was asking if these were the typical symptoms/ normal reaction to the vaccine and if he had that reaction were normal and how long would they usually last. The outcome of chills, headache, itchiness was recovering, of the other events was unknown.

I also had back pain, muscle pain, headaches, continued fever (improved with motrin) and chills. My left arm from my shoulder to my wrist was with noted pain/aches, improved with motrin. On the morning of 1/9 I felt much better, did not take any motrin/tylenol and without any fever/chills.  Noted improvement of muscle aches in general and arm felt  the same as 1/7 (much better!).  Noted lymph swelling of my axillary lymph nodes with aching pain.  This has not gone away at current but improved with x1 dose of motrin.

Upon review of his lab results yesterday, I called the hematology fellow, Dr. through program at hospital and he recommended the labs to be obtained and rechecking labs in one week. He felt the student was not exhibiting any emergent symptoms requiring emergent evaluation. Patient and I spoke on phone after this call with fell at 1557 4/6 and I advised him to seek emergent medical eval in ED for any CP, SOB, HA or any neurologic symptoms. Patient has not had any of those symptoms. He exercised this morning without difficulty.   He notes raised papules on legs which he has had in past. They have currently been present for a few days. He believes it to be related to biking in sweatpants. He has been in a hot tub recently, but after the bumps were present. They do not itch. He has had them in past, more in winter months with heavier clothing.    He also notices slight left arm pain today. This was site of his vaccine. He denies any swollen lymph nodes. He is notices only with arm movement.   He denies any FH of blood disorder/ blood cancers/MDS. He denies bruising, bleeding or dark stools.

                                                I started with significant pain in my left arm at the site of injection the day after injection. The day after I had significant swelling and pain in the lymph nodes in my axilla. This pain last for 3 days. After the pain in axilla resolved I started with significant post nasal drainage. So, 4 days after my shot I developed cold/flu like symptoms. These were very similar to the symptoms I had after actually contracting covid 19. These symptoms have now been present for 4 days. I have no chills or fever. I have had aches, severe sore throat, sinus pressure, nasal congestion.

                                                I woke up the day after my first shot with severe eczema covering both hands, with particular intensity on the fingers. The eczema appeared to get worse over the next day or so, but receded around day 3 or 4, leaving completely about a week after the shot. A few days after the shot, I also began developing a light full body rash, particularly on the sides of my torso. Eventually, after everything faded, I began getting some peeling skin on my fingers, which I assume were caused by the eczema.  I went to urgent care when this rash appeared. Here were her notes:  With patient having a recent diagnosis of strep, opted to order a group A strep test that was negative. Patient did not have any exudate noted in the OP. Patient&#39;s rash did start after having the COVID-19 vaccine. We will have patient continue to monitor for any increasing symptoms. If symptoms fail to improve or worsen over the next week, will have patient return to the urgent care or follow-up with his primary care provider for further evaluation and treatment. Patient may apply lubricating lotion over the areas. He stated that it was not itchy except for on the hands. He may apply calamine ointment or Benadryl cream to the areas of irritation.

Then I felt nerve pain on the same side of leg.  May 14 I couldn&#39;t sit down as I felt occasional lumbar pain. I even went to orthopedics and they said no trouble found. Skin pain spread through the whole body.  May 15 I had second shot of pfizer, still back pain and thigh pain. Skin pain spread through whole body. May 16 I saw red spots begin to surface on the thigh.  Skin pain spread through whole body. May 17 red spot became bigger I thought it was rash, pain persists.  May 18 the red spots looks out of control, I scheduled the next available appointment for primary care (2days later!)   May 19 Just bigger red spots every time I take off my pants.  May 20 black bubbles appeared in the morning, and I got to finally go to appointment at noon, diagnosed as shingles.

                                                At around 1:30 in the morning, i became really weak, achey, had the chills, some nausea, a minor headache, a slight sore throat, and  minor eye pain like they were dry. Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

                                                9 days after the vaccination, the area of my arm where the vaccine was injected became red, swollen and inflamed in a circular area slightly larger than a quarter. There is mild pain and moderate itching. The area feels firmer than the surround areas and is warm to the touch. It is clearly visible from a distance of around 10 ft. I just began experiencing symptoms approximately 2 hours ago, an am monitoring the situation.

He came back to the pharmacy reported the event to the pharmacy, Upon evaluating him he had a small cut on the back of the head.  One of our techs noticed a person from fire rescue in the store shopping she called him over he initially evaluated the patient and called for his emts to come and assess the pt.  I know the took the pt out of the store on a gurney.  they just wanted to assess him in a more private area (in the ambulance), we were in the middle of a clinicwith lots of people around.  Unkown what transpired past that.

Rashes began as patches of dry skin about a week after vaccination, and then progressed into itchy rashes over the course of three weeks. Rashes eventually faded and left areas scared and chronically dry.  Appendix also became inflamed approximately three weeks after vaccination and an emergency appendectomy was required to remove the organ after patient went to urgent care for intense stomach pains. Not known if this is related to vaccination.

He lost all color to his face. Blood pressure was taken and it was 92/60. We gave him a cold pack on the back of his neck and had him lay down and elevate his feet  and legs. Also got him some cold water to drink. He started to feel better in about 15 minutes after that. We continued to monitor blood pressure about every 5 to 10 minutes and it got to 99/72 and last check was 120/65. He did not want the ambulance or to go to urgent care. We told him to take it easy the rest of day and to have somebody with him til next morning. And then he and his friend left to go to his parents house.

He then was standing waiting for his wife to receive her vaccine.  He became dizzy and diaphorectic.  He passed out for a moment.  I kept him in the chair and monitored his breathing and tried to keep him alert and responding  to my questions.

Patient does not have history or drug, vaccine, or food allergies. In particular, no known allergy to polyethylene glycol.

All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

Visited dermatologist on 2/16/21 and was prescribed prednisone, prescription cortisol and hydroxyzin. Some improvement seem in 24 hours since then. Dermatologist was unable to determine source of rash and reaction, thought could be related to vaccine.  Follow up phone call scheduled for 2/19/21

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

                                                11pm on day of (Sunday) vaccination felt soreness in left arm at injection site and in entire upper arm when trying to hold it up. Soreness subsided by noon the next day, Monday. No symptoms on Tuesday until late evening when tongue began to feel sore. On Wednesday morning around 6am, woke up with severe body fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea, headache. Hands and fingers very cold to the touch. Severe fatigue and weakness all day. Sore tongue persisted. No respiratory symptoms present. By Thursday (today), body is still feverish, joint and muscle aches persist, light headache at times. Still fatigued and weak. All symptoms today Thursday are much weaker except for the muscle and joint pain which remains high.  The reason I am reporting this is that from what I&#39;ve read and been told, the delayed onset of these symptoms (almost 3 days) is very unusual, especially because I had little/no symptoms in the first 2 days of the vaccine.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22Mar2021 at 12:30 at the age of 30 years-old, (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included dyspepsia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Severe Heartburn , blood pressure measurement from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Blood pressure , migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for blood pressure for 3 years and ongoing; pantoprazole (PANTOPRAZOLE) taken for stomach medication and heartburn for about a year. Patient states he got the first round 3 weeks ago and he is supposed to get the second dose next Monday but was advised by his doctor not to do that.      Patient states he got the shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and Tuesday 23Mar2021 he was tired and sluggish. On Wednesday 24Mar2021, mid afternoon, he had purple splotches all over his body, in arms and legs, like discoloration, his head felt like it had been dipped in cement and he couldn&#39;t think. States he felt cloudy, dizzy and woozy, nauseous, had a headache and feeling awful. States this occurred like 48 hours after the shot. He contacted a life long friend who is a doctor and works in a covid ward and he told him he was having a reaction and to take some Benadryl and Advil or Tylenol, and the friend told the patient to lay down and rest. He still didn&#39;t feel great but splotches went away and head felt a little bit clearer and he didn&#39;t feel like he was in slow motion or dizzy anymore by Wednesday evening, so he went to bed. On Thursday, the patient went into work but didn&#39;t feel great, not feeling 100%, and about noon on Thursday 25Mar2021, the symptoms started coming back, the purple splotches, his head felt just as bad, he had a headache, slow motion and not himself. The patient called his doctor and his friend and they said he needed to go in and get looked at. The patient tried to go into an urgent care and he states they said nope head to the ER. Patient states he was admitted into the ER and the ER staff said he was having more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave him steroids and an IV but he is not sure what it is and he was given, he thinks, Prednisone over the next couple days to help with side effects, he believes it was Prednisone, he knows it was a steroid. States he is not a fan of it and he doesn&#39;t like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it. Patient states he still gets headaches and maybe it&#39;s something else that is unrelated. States he stopped feeling tired and sluggish maybe the 29Mar2021, a week afterwards. Patient states that he has recovered with lasting effects as he&#39;s been getting migraines since then, states maybe it&#39;s unrelated but didn&#39;t happen a whole lot before. He has severe headaches and nothing he takes seems to help, has to turn lights off and works from home and patient reports that he had one yesterday. Patient states the purple splotches went away after he went to the ER and got on the medicine, the steroids.  P atient states the nausea was pretty constant when a headache comes on, he doesn&#39;t have a headache every day but when he gets a headache he is definitely nauseous.  The outcome of the events was for fatigue and sluggish, recovered with sequela, Purple splotches, dizzy and woozy slow motion, recovered, nausea and headache not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Small cluster of hives appeared on back of neck just around 24 hours after first dose of vaccine. It has been six days since getting the vaccine and still no signs of them disappearing.  Followed the guideline of taking 50mg of diphenhydramine as suggested with minimal success in getting the hives to go down completely.  They will subside slightly sometimes but not at all entirely and are currently still present. There is occasional itchiness which comes and goes as well as  a slight itchy burning sensation in the right hand seemingly random at times.  A small hive also developed on the right hand that does not originate from where the itch on the hand comes from.

                                                Adverse event 4/17/2021: severe chills, high fever (max = 102.7 F) that persisted on and off until 4/22/2021. Worst fevers were at night. Required support from spouse to do every day tasks. Stayed in seated or prone positions the majority of the time from 4/17/2021 to 4/19/2021. Treated with Tylenol. I would take 500 mg every 4 hours or 1000 mg every 6 hours and as I got further into the week I tried not to take Tylenol to avoid masking symptoms, but I would take it if temperature spiked which would happen randomly. Adverse event 4/19/2021: Hives developed on scalp and forehead following approximately 30 minutes of exposure to sunlight. These hives began to spread through 4/20/2021 and into 4/21/2021 to eventually cover entire upper torso including stomach, back, chest, neck, face and head. Treated with Singulair and Zyzol starting 04/21/2021 and stopped treatment once hives were gone on 4/23/2021.

Problems fixed with acetaminophen (650 mg, PO, ADMINISTERED ONCE).  After the first shot (Lot# ER8732), there was immediate soreness at injection site and hives/itchiness (localized in left shoulder (injection site), left armpit and on right side of rib cage) that started 12 days after injection. Diphenhydramine (50 mg, PO q 4 h for 2 days) resulted in no itchiness.

Very dizzy and light-headed. My hearing went away. I closed my eyes for a second and passed out. I awoke about ten minutes later covered in sweat. Felt better at this point and it was my time to leave, so I felt well enough to drive home at that moment. I should have reported the adverse event at the site.

Began to spread along the arm, but nowhere else on the body and develop blisters and redness. Along with rash was constant pain through the whole arm and pain in armpit where lymph node is located.  Went to a healthcare clinic one week later who said it was a possible case of shingles. Took a sample to send to lab. Was prescribed valacyclovir.

                                                Developed tenderness and sensitivity under left arm on rib cage / upper torso area approximately 2 weeks after 2nd dose. It was initially suspected to be a rash or allergic reaction, however there was no redness or visible signs of a rash in the area. Approximately 20 days after 2nd vaccine dose, severe migraine headache occurred which lasted for approximately 6 days. After about 3 days of headaches, COVID-19 test was taken and confirmed negative. This was followed by a visit to urgent care facility. Shot of Toradol was given for the headaches and an anti-inflammatory  prescription was provided. Also mentioned to the nurse practitioner the sensitivity at left rib cage / upper torso area. It was confirmed by a nurse practitioner to be early signs of shingles. Prednisone and anti-viral were prescribed for the shingles outbreak. Thankfully the shingles were caught early enough to be treated immediately and I only missed 5 days of work (Mar 24- Mar 30) and the shingles did not develop into large blisters or boils.

A 31-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730 and expiry date: 31Mar2021), Subcutaneously on 29Dec2020 at 16:40 at single dose at Left Deltoid at Hospital for Prevention. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history, and no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient wanted to know what the recommendations are if the COVID Vaccine was administered subcutaneously. He clarified he received the COVID Vaccine, but he believed it was administered via sub cutaneous with a half inch needle on 29Dec2020 at 16:40. He knew with other vaccines such as the Flu Vaccine, if it is not given intramuscularly, a patient is subject to revaccination. The patient wanted to know if he needs to be revaccinated with the COVID Vaccine since it wasn&#39;t an intramuscular injection. Relevant Tests were None. On 01Jan2021, the patient stated that he had started developing a red bruise like the bubbles on his arm; it seemed more like under the skin there was a bubble and not like inflammatory muscles. The patient reported that the shot was given with the half inch of needle because it was only recommended with the one inch or larger; so actually, he was trying to find it on the mail. The question he wanted to ask was if it went to the deep muscle enough or possibly into the tissue. But over the last, like 24 hours, he has started developing a red bruise like the bubbles on his arm. It didn&#39;t feel like he ever had any muscle pain or anything and it seemed more like under the skin there was a bubble and not like inflammatory muscles. The patient&#39;s weight was reported as 104.33 kg or 230 pounds. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown. Causality between the event &#34;I have start developing a red bruise like the bubbles on my arm; it seems more like under skin there is a bubble and not like inflammatory muscles&#34; and BNT162B2 was reported as related.  Follow-up (01Jan2021): New information received from a contactable pharmacist includes additional events (contusion, blister), an additional laboratory data, and the clinical course of the events.

Woke up at 6:30 am with intense body and head pain.  &#34;was a cant get comfortable in any position type of pulsing pain&#34; Something im accustomed to when i get the Flu.  I rolled around in pain for 4 hours while trying to go back to sleep; it even hurt to breathe deeply. - took Tylenol at 11am and the symptoms never came back.  *Note.  I think i suffered so much pain in the 4 hours that it lasted with me until even now as i write this.  Hard to describe, but my entire body has had this tiny ache that has not gone away.  Not a big deal to me, but just wanted it documented.  I am selecting recovered even with that tiny ache still apparent because physical pain usually takes time to heal.  Assuming that&#39;s all it is.

                                                I had soreness around my arm of injection site for about 3  days.    I also wanted to let you all know that I had a sore throat that started the day after my first dose.  Sore throat started off as mild but later got worse by the 2nd day.  I also experienced a mild grade fever, headaches, and chills which went away in a couple of days.  HOWEVER, today (1-14-2021) I decided to rule out the possibility of me having COVID.  So I got tested for covid and I was tested positive via the RT-PCR at a local urgent care facility.    So with that being said I am not quite sure if the sore throat, mild grade fever, headaches, and chills were part because of the vaccine dose (first dose)  or it could have been from  experiencing covid symptoms.    Treatment I used were drinking LOTS of water, Tylenolol and Advil, Cephacol lozenges,  and sleep.

                                                Within 2-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy.  I signaled for help while in my car  and help arrived. Within the next few minutes the severity seemed to go from ?0-100? and I began to feel a deep impending sense of doom and panic/fear. I also felt extremely tense in my muscles and felt itchy in the chest area. That continued for 15 minutes or so before subsiding slowly. Staff surrounded my car and were very supportive and great about the situation.   It was one of the most frightening experiences to date I have had. No EpiPen type intervention was done. Once the event was on the downswing I was kept for additional observation and release on my own accord.  Everyone there was great. I am reporting for my own records in case further testing reveals I have an allergy to this vaccine for employment purposes should the vaccine become mandated prior to me having alternative means of vaccination or allergy testing competed to determine if it was an true reaction or not so I can get vaccinated safely.

                                                I had some minor bruising but the most particular thing was these small red dots that appeared on my arm at the injection site. Probably a total of eight small red dots size of a little bigger of a pen tip. Appear to be blood pooling. They were in a straight line that seemed to outline the Band-Aid so it really stood out as strange. No pain nothing else going on. Just kind of a weird sight.

                                                7 days after receiving my first shot, I developed rashes/hives under both of my arms in my armpit and down my arm a bit. I waited a few days and then on Feb 24th went to an clinic to receive a steroid cream which mostly resolved that. However, the rash/hives continued to spread across my body and are now on my sides, chest, back, arms and neck. I went to the clinic and received a steroid pack. The consensus from my clinic was that this was likely a reaction to the vaccine -

He experienced fatigue, malaise, ear pain, head congestion, fever day 1-3, followed by general improvement but development of a diffuse erythematous maculopapular pruritic exanthem, loss of taste and smell day 4, and episodic bloody diarrhea day 6 or 7. The exanthem has had limited (if any) response to steroid (day 5-9) and he has continued to self treat with Benadryl and atarax at home. He has just been released from quarantine. The dermatitis is improved but not resolved. CBC and CMP were normal.

Woke up the next day with mild to severe body aches, muscle soreness, joint pain and pain in my stomach/abdomen. Developed a 101 fever 24 hrs after receiving the vaccine, and continued until this morning (3/16). Vomiting multiple times in the middle of the night on 3/14. The vomiting was only a one night deal, but every other symptom that I experienced has been persistent until this morning. I feel about 80% back at the moment. Symptoms were very similar, maybe even a little more extreme, than the ones I experienced when I contracted Covid months ago, but they didn?t last as long.

                                                Shingles flare up; Shingles flare up; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 31-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID VACCINE; lot number: EL9262; expiration date: unknown) at 31-year-old vaccination age via an unspecified route of administration in the right deltoid on 18Feb2021 9:00 AM as a single dose to protect self (covid-19 immunization). Medical history included chicken pox virus as a kid and shingles. The patient has no family medical history. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccination included varicella zoster vaccine (CHICKENPOX VACCINE) for vaccination for chicken pox and received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID VACCINE; lot number: EL3246) at unknown vaccination age via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on an unspecified date as a single dose to protect self (covid-19 immunization). The patient received the vaccine in a hospital and did not receive other vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported that he just got a flare up of shingles on 28Feb2021 and doesn&#39;t know if it is related or not to the covid vaccination he took. The patient reported that he did nothing unusual in the last 14 days. Doesn&#39;t know if that is something to report to see if there was any trending. The patient inquired if a shingles flare-up has happened before after the COVID vaccine. He got the vaccine ten days before (18Feb2021) the shingles flare up started. He added that it is on right side of torso in the thorax area and goes from midline abdomen all the way to midline on his back on the right side. The adverse event required urgent care visit (emergency room visit). The nurse considered the event serious. The patient did not have relevant tests and was only clinically diagnosed with a shingles flare up. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug to the reported event &#34;Shingles flare up&#34; cannot be completely excluded based on temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identifies as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notifies to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I don&#39;t know if this is related to the Pfizer vaccine I received, but I started having symptoms about a week and half after taking the vaccine.  I had chicken pox as a kid, and the case has been really mild, but I thought this was important to report, because I have read where other people reported similar things happening.

                                                5 days after vaccination, left arm got progressively more sensitive to the tough. Rash appeared along spinal column, on chest, and on left shoulder blade by day 6 after vaccination. Rash turned more pustular, with increased sensitivity and needling feeling. On day 9, diagnosed with herpes zoster reactivation (shingles).

                                                When the needle entered my arm, that felt normal. But I felt extreme pressure and immediate pain as soon as the plunger got depressed. After the needle was removed, I continued to feel pain within my shoulder, not at the injection site.  On my ride home, the pain started to worsen and was very painful when I got home, throughout my shoulder joint.  I took Advil when I got home, and have taken it very 6 hours since, along with lots of water.  I have used a heating pad with some immediate relief but no improvement in the pain.  I am trying to stretch and move the arm, but am requiring assistance with even that because of how much pain is involved with simple movements.  It does not seem nerve related as it does not radiate down my arm.  The pain is isolated to my shoulder joint.

The next day he noticed sore shoulder at 3 PM on 4/20 he noted he had upper wrist pain that progressed to his right thumb as well as redness with a shiny quality that was consistent with previous gout flares so he took 2 doses of colchicine and 2 doses of Advil which did not relieve his symptoms.  A couple hours later he noted hand numbness and tingling as well as feet numbness and tingling bilaterally.  The numbness progressed to his extremities with the left arm more affected than the right arm (he received vaccine in his left arm).  He had accompanied pain of his extremities and wrists that was described as 10 out of 10.  He then felt 2 episodes of chest tightness and difficulty breathing prompting him to present to the strong ED.  In the ED his exam was notable for hypertension (240/90), tachycardia, wrist flexion in distress and yelling in pain.  His exam also showed bilateral hyperflexion of bilateral wrist with mild swelling and diminished sensation and motor function throughout.  He was administered IV hydromorphone, and Benadryl with dramatic improvement in his symptoms.  His labs are notable for abnormal electrolytes including magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium and he was repleted with magnesium potassium and phosphorus.  He is admitted to ED OBS. overall felt his symptoms were most likely due to gout flare and hyperventilation, not likely related to vaccine.

                                                24-48 hours post injection, pt experienced a sore arm consistent with other immunizations which resolved shortly thereafter.   9 days post immunization, pt experienced pain and inflammation in the area of the injection. Symptoms included radiating pain into the scapular area, mimicking that of a labral tear. Pt continues to experience pain/inflammation at the site of the injection that continues to radiate and feels like a fatigued arm with excessive movement (as of today (Day 14)).

                                                7-8 Days after 2nd dose of COVID Vaccine, the skin on my fingers started to peel like they would after a sunburn.  There was no prior rash.  I can only remember around 4 days after the vaccine, my fingers felt warm as if they had a sunburn, but I had no exposure to sun, UV, or any heat source that might explain the heat/peeling.  This did not occur to my wife, who received the same vaccine at the exact same times from the exact same batch from the exact same CVS.  The only side-effect she had was a swollen thumb on the hand belonging to the arm which received the vaccine.  This last form day 2 till about day 6 after the 2nd dose.  Did not occur during 1st dose, so we don&#39;t know if its related to the vaccine.  Again, we found no other cause for the potential swollen Thumb.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

                                                Upon receiving the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I immediately felt tingling or chills in the arm where the shot was administered.  This developed into muscle soreness as I sat through the waiting period before leaving the facility.  (For this reason, I had taken acetaminophen at about 8:30 that morning.)  I experienced both of these symptoms after my first shot of this COVID-19 vaccine, so these did not concern me.  After taking a nap back at my house, I woke up about 3:30 p.m. experiencing some partial numbness in my left arm, which received the injection.  It was not inhibitive, but I can somewhat relate it to the neuropathy my mother experienced before being diagnosed with diabetes in 2005.  It was a bit like the tingling I first experienced after the injection, but throughout the injected arm.  As I continued through that afternoon and evening, my arm kept getting stiffer and stiffer.  This prompted me to take my temperature at about 8 p.m. and then again at 10 p.m. Both of these tests resulted in a normal temperature of 98.3 or 98.4 degrees.  By the time I was about to climb into bed at midnight, the stiffness had spread to my shoulder joint -- such that almost any movement of that arm elicited some mild discomfort, especially if I leaned against the wall with that shoulder or raised my arm above my head.  I took a third dose of acetaminophen.  My normal prone sleeping position was not comfortable with this stiffness, so I did my best to sleep on my back.  Next, I woke up too hot about 3:30 a.m. (Wednesday, May 26) and could not get back to sleep.  Full-body chills set in soon after, prompting me to turn off my ceiling fan.  I faced some mild nausea as I attempted to get comfortable in bed again.  I suspected I was feverish by at least 4 a.m., but I did not get up to check my temperature until 5 a.m. The thermometer gave a reading of 100.3 degrees, so I took another dose of acetaminophen (my fourth in 24 hours) and tried to go back to sleep.

I came close to losing consciousness and was instructed to lay down with my knees bent to increase blood flow. I slowly came to over the course of probably 10 minutes while laying on the ground, but my hands and especially my fingers remained numb for 30-45 minutes while I experienced chills. My left hand and fingers were extremely pale and bluish during this time. I also had minor pains on the left side of my neck and left shoulder blade. Color came back to my left hand and chills subsided around an hour after my shot.

                                                After first shot there was minimal effects, just a sore arm and fatigue.  These went away within a day or so.   Second shot had immedate fatigue, body aches, and headache within 12 hours.  Again these subsided within 48 hours.  However within the week I developed a mild red rash across my body from my chest down to my knees, and an ache in my left ankle.  I assumed I had twisted the ankle without realizing and the rash had to do with my seasonal allergies.  I began taking Benadryl for the rash and rested the ankle, but the rash only slightly faded and while the ankle got slightly better, the ache moved to my right shoulder, then my  left elbow, then the left knee, then right knee, then to the joints in fingers on my right hand.   Finally mos recently the ache has moved to joints in the left hand.  Each time the aches move the previous location feels slightly better but isn&#39;t back up to 100 percent.  And aches seem to move every 4/5 days.   It has now been over a month since the second shot and the joints of my body still feels abnormal and strained.  And in the last few days I have developed a terrible headache that doesn&#39;t seem to go away.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 31-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot number: EW0167, Expiration Date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12May2021 at 08:30 (at the age of 31 years old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation in a hospital. Medical history included overactive bladder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has known allergies with beeswax. Prior to vaccine the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included tolterodine, xantofyl (LUTEIN), fish oil and vitamin d, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines in 4 weeks. When the patient got his shot of BNT162B2, the patient  felt no pain when the nurse administered the shot. On 12May2021 at 21:00, the patient started to feel numbness occasionally in the thenar muscle on the radial side of the patient&#39;s left hand. The numbness was most obvious during complex hand movements such as hand washing and but it wasn&#39;t persistent. It was further described that it felt like the sudden numbness the patient gets when he accidentally hit his elbow against the wall but less intense. The patient woke up the next day with persistent numbness in his entire left hand, affecting the wrist, palm, and all 5 fingers. This persistent numbness the patient had felt was like the numbness he gets when he was sleeping on his side with his hands under his head. It extended to the patient&#39;s distal forearm on 15May2021. At the day of the report ,the 5th day after vaccination (as reported), the soreness of the injection site had subsided but both types of numbness in the patient&#39;s left hand remained. They&#39;re were not as bad as &#34;pins and needles&#34; and there was no tingling sensation but it was concerning the patient. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of all events was not recovered.

This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

                                                Swollen lymph nodes; Developed Shingles on his face; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional. This other healthcare professional reported for a 32-year-old male patient (her fiance). A 32-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2  on 08Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient developed shingles on his face on 31Jan2021 and swollen lymph nodes on 01Feb2021. The events were reported as serious (medically significant) and worsened. There were no investigation assessment. The patient had not recovered from the events at the time of the report.    Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the Company considers the event swollen lymph nodes is possibly related to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. Other than a temporal association, there is no evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the event shingles, which is likely an intercurrent condition. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Muscle soreness, weakness, and limited mobility in the area of the injection, peaked in intensity 10 hours after the dose was administered. Soreness is still ongoing as of this form submission, but isn&#39;t as intense.  Insomnia, occurred 12 hours after the dose was administered, it took me about 2.5 hours to fall asleep after going to bed (12:00AM - 2:30 AM)

                                                About two weeks after first shot, I got shingles. It could be unrelated, but since I&#39;m young, perfectly healthy, not abnormally stressed, and haven&#39;t ever had singles before, I thought there might be a chance it is related. I&#39;ve seen online other young people who are saying that they got shingles after the first shot of Moderna or Pfizer.  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I figured it was worth reporting. It is overall a pretty mild case because I got on the antiviral drugs pretty quickly. Wondering if I should still get my second shot on schedule or wait until my shingles is all cleared. I have asked my doctor and am awaiting a response. I first noticed the symptoms on Saturday (3/20) exactly two weeks after my first shot.

                                                Approximately 9 days after injection in left arm, started experiencing symptoms in right armpit consistent with swollen lymph nodes including: intermittent sharp stinging pain similar to ingrown hair or inflamed hair follicle, as well redness and dull pain upon palpation. Over several days, swelling has increased significantly and pain has increased a little as well. Today, 14 days after injection in left arm, starting to experience onset of lymph node swelling in left armpit as well. Additionally, starting 9 days after injection, concomitant with lymph node swelling, I believe I have felt slightly fatigued and have felt 1 degree warmer than usual, though not actually feverish. I confirmed a temperature of 98.9F today around 5:45PM, whereas my normal temperature is about 97.7F when measured by the same method.

Then also developed the same thing up on my collar bone area (may be a lymph node) that is more sensitive to the touch than my arm.  Makes me arm feel somewhat numb and harder to grip at times.

He states that by the afternoon of the next day he developed severe headache, nausea, and feeling feverish. He states in the middle of the night he started vomiting red-colored vomit which he felt was from blood. He vomited approximately six times over an hour. The vomiting stopped after that. He also complained of soreness at the injection site which spread to shoulder. He rated his pain at that time as a ?7? on the ?1-10? pain scale. As of 4/9/21, he now feels better with no further symptoms other than muscle soreness. RN encouraged patient to follow up with his PCP to let them know about his symptoms including his complaint of bloody vomiting. Patient agreed to follow up with his PCP.

                                                Felt mild itchiness at various parts of my body, starting a few hours after the shot was given. I&#39;m not positive if the itchy feelings began within the first 4 hours after the shot, but I think so. I took an antihistamine before bed that night. The next day I occasionally felt very minor tingling, which I believe was the itchiness diminishing. By the third day the itchiness/tingling was gone. I never developed a rash, hives, or swelling. I spoke with my primary care physician during an unrelated annual physical exam that took place a couple days after the vaccination, and he said it&#39;s possible it was a very mild allergic reaction, but in his determination it was nothing to be concerned about or to prevent me from getting the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine 21 days later.

                                                First day was just soreness at and around the injection site. The next day on the other hand. I woke up from what felt like hitting the exhaustion wall. Along the lines of being so worn out you can&#39;t even sleep. Along with heavy lethargy, soreness, a mental fuzziness, and a general feeling of unwell. To the point of forgoing water and food while famished as it meant having to move and stand in front of the stove. By about 1700ish I started to notice chill&#39;s/fever (I think, I did not grab a thermometer and check)  As of the time of writing this some of the lethargy has subsided. Though the rest has stuck around. Given that the second dose is more known to cause adverse effects. I am not looking forward to it. Which is to no way state that i won&#39;t go back and get my second dose. Just that at least for me are pretty rough.

They would be red and raised, almost like a small mosquito bite. Then they would dissipate, although some would leave a tiny red dot.   Almost seemed that there was a bug in my clothing, so I showered, changed my clothes, and searched thoroughly in bed, closet, clothes for, bugs but there were none. My wife also did not get any of these itchy bumps in spite of sharing a bed.   It may be worth noting that my wife got shingles 10 days after receiving the 1st Pfizer dose.

A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered on the left arm on 04Mar2021 09:45 (also reported as 12:00) (Batch/Lot Number: EN6199) at the age of 32 years old as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seasonal allergies (had it his whole life), sore arm and a family history of shingles (he&#39;s had an uncle or something that had shingles before but nothing with his parents). The patient had no allergies to medications, food or other products. Concomitant medication included loratadine (CLARITINE) from Feb2021 for seasonal allergies. The patient wanted to know on what he should expect after receiving the second dose of the vaccine and if he was eligible to receive the vaccine. The patient reported side effects on v-safe. He heard from other doctors that shingles had been reported from the first dose of the vaccine. He wanted to know if shingles would impact the antibodies that he may develop post vaccination. The patient stated that the fact sheet indicated that the second dose should be administered 3 weeks after the first dose, he was scheduled to receive the second dose 4 weeks later and wanted to know if it was safe to receive the vaccine outside the of the recommended time frame. The patient stated that he should be trying to take loratadine everyday (usually takes at night before bed) 1 since he does get kind of bad allergies sometimes. On 12Mar2021 (8 days later after the vaccination), the patient was diagnosed with shingles after breaking out in a rash on his scalp, chest and neck. The patient met his doctor and was recommended to report the adverse event. The patient went through CDC V safe and was provided with an information sheet that from Walgreens that listed the number for Pfizer to call if he needed further information. The patient reported that the noticed the rash (present on his scalp, chin, neck and up around his neck on his right side) on 06Mar2021 or 07Mar2021. The patient stated that the rash onset was &#34;two fold&#34;. He noticed it when the back of his head on the right side started to become agitated in Mar2021.  He stated that he sleeps with an eye mask on due to block out the lights from the baby monitor for his 6-month-old and originally thought that it was the sleep mask that was bothering him. He mentioned that on 06Mar2021 or 07Mar2021, he felt like he had a scratch on his scalp and his wife told him that it looked a little swollen. He then reported that the rash on his scalp started to get more and more uncomfortable. When the patient came home on 10Mar2021 around 17:00 or 17:30, he removed his shirt and his wife looked at him and asked what it was. He then reported that the rash appeared on his neck and chin and showed up overnight or that morning. He then stated that the rash on his chin and neck was not painful or anything. The patient then stated that the rash on his head was getting pretty agitated as of 10Mar2021. The patient thought that the rash on his chin, neck, and chest was eczema or heat rash, but thought it was odd because heat rash is normally flat. When he woke up on Wednesday (10Mar2021), the rash was looking worse but was still not bothering him except for the rash on his head. He considered going to urgent care on Thursday (11Mar2021) but didn&#39;t follow through. On Thursday night to Friday night (11Mar2021 to 12Mar2021), he couldn&#39;t sleep. His rash felt like a sunburn or if like he was hit with a cactus, and the rash on his neck started to bother him. The patient went to urgent care on 12Mar2021, and when the nurse practitioner walked in, looked at him and said that it was shingles. The patient saw 3 people at the urgent care, a nurse, nurse practitioner and a resident doctor as a doctor was needed to confirm the diagnosis. All three of the staff members said that the rash was shingles where the rash was following a nerve pattern. The patient used a cream to treat the rash, he mentioned that he tried diphenhydramine HCl 2%, zinc acetate 0.1% (Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream, Topical Analgesic Skin Protectant; Lot 1790LZ/3, Exp: May2022) briefly on the back of his scalp for 1 night as it was starting to itch and feel weird. He mentioned that it did sting some but didn&#39;t think anything of it as sometimes the cream will sting when put over a scab. He also used Aquaphor Healing Ointment Baby Advanced Therapy (Exp: Aug2022, UPC: 0 7214063386 8; NART number 63386), taking slabs of it and putting it over the rash. He then stated that neither did anything. After going to the urgent care, he was put on antibiotics (late described as an antiviral that should clear up in 7 to 10 days since he was young and healthy) that day and essentially said there was not much he could do. The staff also recommended that because he had 6-month-old he should call his son&#39;s pediatrician but that his infant son should be okay. He followed up with his son&#39;s pediatrician and his doctor, who stated that it should be fine, just to minimize contact with his son. The rash was still visible on his chin, neck and chest. On his scalp was harder to see because of his hair. He stated that going on feel, outside of one spot it felt significantly better. He can now wash his hair and lay on that side of his head without pain. The rash on his neck looks like some are starting to scab over.  He reported that not one patch has disappeared yet, but his wife said that it was looking less red and inflamed. His doctor scheduled a routine blood draw for 08Mar2021 during his physical and stated that he was willing to go through test results as he was unsure what would be helpful, but there were numerous results for each lab test (CBC with auto differential, Lipid panel with reflex to direct LDL, Comprehensive metabolic panel, PSA, total, Urinalysis, and Vitamin D (25-hydroxy) total).  He reported that his doctor had sent him a message in the evening on 08Mar2021 that said &#34;results all normal&#34;. The patient didn&#39;t require a visit to the emergency room but required a visit to physician office. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He stated that there was no history of his parents experiencing an adverse event with vaccines, just the usual sore arm, stuff like that. On 19Mar2021, the pharmacist reported that the events were non-serious. The pharmacist reported that the treatment used for the event was famciclovir. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events pruritic rash and erythematous rash was recovering, for shingles was recovered, while unknown for the other events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                I received the COVID-19 vaccine at 9:30 am from vaccination clinic. I had just recovered from COVID-19 about two and a half weeks prior. I had no immediate reaction. I worked the entire day with no adverse effects other than a sore arm, which I expected. Later in the day at about 7:45 pm I went for a 6 mile run and got home at approximately 8:49 pm. Within half an hour of getting home, I quickly became feverish. The fever continued to rise until I was extremely hot, and hotter than I can ever remember as an adult or child. I did not have access to a thermometer so I cannot reliably report what the temperature was but I am estimating 103. It felt like every part of my body, including my legs, was hot to the touch. By 1 am I had serious chills and was shivering under winter blankets despite an outdoor temperature of 70-80. In addition, I had an extremely elevated heart rate and chest pain. I also had generalized muscle aches all over my body.  I did not sleep at all that night. The fever began to slowly dissipate early in the morning but the elevated heart rate continued for approximately 24 hours. The discomfort resulting from my elevated heart rate was substantial and alarming enough that I sought advice from my primary care physician after a nurse at my Occupational Health clinic suggested potentially getting an ECG. Ultimately, by Thursday morning, the symptoms had decreased and I declined any follow up. However, this was the single worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to any vaccine and the single worst fever I&#39;ve ever experienced as an adult or in my memory as a child. Although I am aware that people who have already had COVID-19 tend to have worse reactions to the first COVID vaccine, I am filing this report primarily because of my concern that exercise may trigger an especially severe reaction.

This week the pain got much more noticeable. My right arm by inside bicep has a pain of burning and itching. My right leg has burning nerve pain in multiple spots. I know my body and this is 100% because of the vaccine. The pain itself is not very bad, but it?s very noticeable. Burning sensation in different parts of my right limbs. Will this go away? I fear getting my second shot and this getting worse. Any advice?

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

A 33-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose on right arm, mid bicep for COVID-19 immunization. There were no patient history. Concomitant medications included hepatitis b vaccine on 14Dec2020, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]), calcium and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number:EK5730) on 18Dec2020 (left arm) and he experienced little pain around the injection site, some nausea and some bouts of dizziness. The patient received the Covid 19 Vaccine 4 days after receiving the Hepatitis B vaccination, so he identified this as an error in administration. So the Hepatitis B vaccination was given on 14Dec2020 and the first Covid 19 Vaccine was given on 18Dec2020. He received the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that originally the prescriber who administered it the first two doses had scheduled him to receive the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine as the same day as his second Hepatitis B Vaccination and he identified this error last Wednesday and stated &#34;I believe or potentially today, I&#39;m not sure which one I&#39;m sorry I had to check with that&#34;. So, he was trying to get this all cleared up. He did report symptoms for both Covid Vaccines as little pain around the injection site, some nausea, some bouts of dizziness. So, patient had already discussed the common adverse reactions with him. Patient was told that co-administration has not been studied yet and referred him to his HCP for continued guidance on how and when to space out the additional Hepatitis B vaccination that he will need. Patient was &#34;32&#34; back in December when this happened. He had his birthday and turned 33. Second shot for the Covid was scheduled the same day the Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) but due to inveigle in-charge of the vaccine, he had lost his paper work and he had been on vacation and stated &#34;had been vaccine was not found they just gave me the second Covid Vaccine and told me to come back by Thursday and I should have found it and have everything cleared up by then but then Wednesday they called me and told me that they have realized that they are not supposed to give vaccine co-administered with 14 days window before or after. I haven&#39;t got my second Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) just the first one was administered within the 4 days period of the first shot&#34;. Patient work at Dietary Providence. The patient had his blood drawn this morning (20Jan2021). Patient does not have product details for hepatitis B vaccine. Patient stated that the nurse on duty had said that the vaccine they had stocks was &#34;Engerix-B hepatitis B recombinant&#34; but that was not verified as far as definitively is just what she had stocked when he was going on his incident report. Patient further stated, &#34;As far as all things are concerned you know I went to a doctor got checked he said breathing was great, heart rate was great, oxygen level 98 percent, he has drawn blood by then is there anything that I should be doing at this point cataloging thing any other test any other people to contact. What should I do going forward specially what can I do to be helpful for you guys to get this situation clear.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 19Jan2021 04:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines in 4 weeks. The patient experienced pain at the injection site on 10Feb2021, after receiving the second dose and would compare the feeling to a bad bruise approximately after 17 hours the patient had chills and approximately after 19 hours the patient started to develop aches, particularly in lower back. The aches were not severe and were more of a nuisance. Approximately after 21 hours the patient, developed a headache and felt warm in the head. The headache slowed her down and was bothersome for the remainder of the day. The headache was almost completely gone when she woke up the next day. My head no longer felt warm when I woke up. Events were not treated. All the events were recovered when she wok up next day.

A 33-year-old patient (husband) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 05Apr2021 15:40 (Lot Number: ER8734) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atopic dermatitis. Concomitant medication included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), an injection that patient takes every other week to control his atopic dermatitis, he has been using this for 3 years at least. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER6207) in left shoulder on 15Mar2021 15:40, at the age of 32 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, and experienced arm sore and body aches. The patient experienced vomiting blood in Apr2021, blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up / spitting up blood in Apr2021, he feels like his throat is so raw on 05Apr2021, sore arm on 05Apr2021, feeling achy/ her husband is still sore/achy today on 05Apr2021, nauseous on 05Apr2021, vomiting/ throwing up on 05Apr2021, diarrhea on 05Apr2021, chilly in Apr2021, redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids; his pores looked red in Apr2021, fatigue on 05Apr2021. No treatment received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events pain in arm, ache, nauseous, erythema, fatigue was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Clinical course as reported: Her husband got their second dose of the vaccine on 05Apr2021. Her husband was having a more severe reaction than the first time. The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller&#39;s husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o&#39;clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn&#39;t like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid. Wife added what she was trying to see was if she should take her husband to the hospital or not. She did not want to wait too long, but if this was something that was a side effect that was expected, then her husband could just sleep it off.

                                                I got shingles about one month after the second dose. I had severe pain around my spine and back on Friday (4/23/2021) and by the next morning developed red bumps on the left side of my nose that I at first mistook for acne. They produced a very tiny amount of white liquid secretion. The bumps turned darker and I got a red rash on the left side of my nose. The left side of my face as well as the lymph nodes around my collar area swelled up. By Tuesday morning, it spread to my left eye, so I went to the ER where they started me on two new antibiotics. After none of the antibiotics worked, I started an antiviral (acyclovir) and antiviral eye drops and started to improve. The rash and swelling reduced and no new blisters have formed. The doctor and I both thought it likely I had shingles.

After a large dose of Benadryl it finally stopped swelling after 15 min-30min after taking them. The rash, hives and swelling went away after 3 hours.  I have never experienced any kind of swelling or rash to beestings of any kind, especially not honeybees.

I got a severe reaction from the Pfizer vaccine. I got the normal chills the next day and flu symptoms. From the next day to day 5 I got severe headaches, strong pain in my head, my left arm and left eye. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen within those days. The Tylenol didn&#39;t help at all, ibuprofen 200mg didn&#39;t do much. Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot. I heard the first dose 80-90 percent immunity or even more. With my body I never had this reaction. Today I&#39;m a whole lot better (day 6).

                                                After getting my second shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine, I waited for 30 minutes according to the protocol and I left for home after the wait. While on the way home, I developed rash on my both arms and felt dizzy. I pulled over to a parking lot but before I could park my car, I passed out. I couldn&#39;t control my car and I bumped into another parked car. All this happened in a matter of 15 seconds. My wife and my daughter was with me. When I regained consciousness, my wife was doing CPR on. A bystander in the parking lot called EMS for me.

A 33-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6205, Expiration date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 09:30 AM (left arm) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included obesity, sleep apnea, acid reflux, and triglycerides high. Concomitant medications included fenofibrate, omeprazole ongoing for acid reflux, fish oil (FISH OIL OMEGA 3) at 300 mg twice a day, and multivitamin. The patient previously took clindamycin and cyclobenzaprine and had allergy. The patient stated, &#34;I ended up getting hives 10 or 11 hours after I received Pfizer-COVID-19 Vaccine (first dose at 9:30 am 04Mar2021)&#34;. It was reported that, about 10 hours after he received the injection, he had hives breakout on his back. They seem to reappear everyday around 4:00 PM or 5:00 PM since this past Thursday. They don&#39;t show up in the same spot. He felt that the vaccine was working in his body because he had hives on his back, chest, legs, and arms. On 04Mar2021, he got it at approximately 9:30 AM. He noticed everything starting to itch around 8 PM. On day 1 his entire back was covered. On day 2 it was more about 50 % and then 25 % on the arms and chest. It was better from the first day, but it still hadn&#39;t gone away. He did have reactions to two things a while back. They were both listed on the form he gave the person administering the vaccine. It was not a concern listed online. The reaction he had was jitteriness from a muscle relaxer. The name of the muscle relaxer started with a C, but he didn&#39;t remember. He didn&#39;t have the lot number for the muscle relaxer. He couldn&#39;t remember what the other medication was he had a reaction to. It had been 10 years or so. He wanted to get the second vaccine and he was not sure if Pfizer would see something that would prevent him from getting it. He went the next day and got a Prednisone shot at his PCP&#39;s office. He did not have the NDC, lot, and expiry for the Prednisone shot. His sister got the same dose somewhere else and had no reaction. His mom didn&#39;t have any reaction. Caller clarified what information he was looking for. The nurse practitioner told him not to get it. His PCP told him he should. He was reading conflicting things online. Some said hives were serious and some said mild reaction. He was trying to understand how severe of a reaction it was and should he get it based on Pfizer&#39;s studies. The outcome of the event was not recovered at the time of report.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Started small on elbows and gradually moved to the legs, face, arms, fingers, hips, torso throughout 6/7.  6/8 still present over most of body.  I would like to note that I have had hive outbreaks in the past through about age 20 while living in state.  No cause was determined if allergy vs viral.  This could just be my body&#39;s way of fighting viruses and not an actual cause of the vaccine itself.  However, I still wanted to report as the hives occurred the day after the 2nd vaccine dose.

                                                At onset, rash covering upper portion of chest, mildly itchy. Over the following approximately 48 hours, the rash spread progressively down torso to waist. After reaching waist on front of body, it continued at top of back and moved down progressively to shoulder blades. When it reached this point, it was still present everywhere it had already appeared. After the approximately 48 hours of spreading, it retreated in the reverse progression over the course of about 72 hours. So it gradually cleared on the back, then cleared on front of torso starting at waist and cleared gradually moving up the torso.  No medication was taken at any time to treat the rash or any other condition/illness.  Waited until 2nd vaccine dose to ask vaccine clinic if I could treat it if it reoccurs. They suggested Benadryl unless it becomes more serious than what was described to them.

                                                Left arm was incapacitated for nearly a week after the initial injection. Arm could not be lifted more than a few inches away from torso, and pain felt like severe deep cramping constantly. No bruising or mark at the site of the injection just severe muscle pain that affected all movement and sleep.  After one week I regained more mobility but still had severe pain in the shoulder muscles around injection site. At the 3 week mark I have more mobility but still struggle with a full range of motion and lifting anything more than a few pounds.

                                                I started noticing itching a week after the vaccine. I had painful lesions on my armpit, on my back underneath my shoulder blade and on my buttock. The lesions were very painful. I was diagnosed with Shingles two weeks after the first dose of the vaccine. I had to delay the second dose because I was taking the medicine for the Shingles. The Shingles cleared up a week after I started the medication. I was also exposed to Covid-19 during that time but tested negative. I also have a lingering achy feeling in the back of my throat over the last couple of months. It is an uncomfortable feeling.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

The soreness went away however after a week I&#39;m still feeling a little bit of a headache and dizziness.  I&#39;m still able to function relatively fine. It&#39;s especially noticeable when I&#39;m just sitting down. When I&#39;m exercising I really don&#39;t notice it. It also tends to be worse in the evening.

The next morning my right arm still hurt, but it was not worst. However my left hand and left elbow felt very stiff. When I tried to bend my left elbow it hurt a bit. When I tried to bend my fingers on my left hand it hurt very much. I couldn&#39;t even make a fist it hurt so much. I kept slowly bending my elbow and bending my fingers until the pain and stiffness would go away. Most of the pain and stiffness went away, but a little still remained. It feels like I have some kind of Arthritis in my left hand and left elbow, but I have never had it before. Since I got the COVID-19 vaccine, every time I wake up I have been experience the same thing.

                                                Vaccine was received  Friday around noon. Friday night i had a headache. By Saturday morning I had muscle aches, chills, and terrible headache. Muscle aches, chills and headache resolved by early Sunday morning. Sunday morning around 9am an itchy rash started on the abdomen. Over the course of 30 minutes it moved from the stomach area to other parts of the body (shoulders, back, head, feed, hands, etc, only the face and neck have avoided seeing rash). It pops up and then dissipates and then moves to another area over the course of 30 minutes to an hour. It has been two weeks since the shot and the rash is still present, coming and going, moving around the body. Allergy medication controls the rash, but when the medication wears off the rash returns.

As the day went on it got worse. By evening it was the worst arm pain I have ever felt in my arm. I could not lift my right arm at all. ( I could lift my hand by bending my elbow but could not use my deltoid muscle). I could not sleep that night due to the pain. I took Tylenol every 4 hours which only slightly helped.  The next day it hurt the same amount - very, very bad. Felt like a truck hit my arm. Had to have my husband help me put my shoes on. I could not drive.  That second night I took more medication. The third day the pain finally subsided for the most part. On day four I was all better.

                                                Within 15 minutes of receiving my first dose of the Phizer vaccine a portion of my arm went numb as if I received Novocain from the Dentist. This only impacted the portion of my arm between my elbow and shoulder. My hand was not numb. My entire head also felt as if I was coming off Novacain. I would also get hot and cold flashes. My upper body was itchy. I also felt like I was having circulation issues (like if you sleep in a weird position). The tips of my fingers and toes would be cold. I believe the Novacain issue was attributable to the shot but some of my other issues might have been the result of a panic attack as a result of my face going numb. I went to the ER but by the time I saw the doctor around 12:00pm most of these symptoms were going away. I went to bed and woke up much better. I can feel my arm now. It just feels sore but what I expected it to feel like after the shot. The Novacain feeling in my head went away now I just have a mild headache. The key symptom I was concerned about was the Novacain feeling given my wife also received the shot and did not have this experience.

                                                I had a nasty zit on the back of my neck, popped it, and my immune response was extreme. Initial: Itching and burning through my neck and shoulders, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and collarbone. I began sweating at night profusely and losing weight. I have had a lot of trouble sleeping. These symptoms continued in 24-48 hour cycles of flare ups until 04/19/2021 but finally seem to be abating. Progression: secondary symptoms appeared over the course of the month such as full body joint soreness, weakness, stiffness, stabbing pains (in the neck, arms, chest, and abdomen), blood pressure spikes, dry/sore throat, dry eyes, difficulty swallowing. Symptoms are similar to arthritis or other autoimmune diseases. Night sweats continue but are lighter. Weight loss continues but slower. Sleeping remains irregular.

He was provided a bottle of water and 2 tablets of Benadryl 25 mg tablets. He seemed to be anxious and walked around the store in an agitated manner. The pharmacy team kept monitoring him for another 15 minutes, he reported that his numbing condition was getting worse. We asked if we could call 911 and he agreed. The 911 team arrived within 15 minutes and checked his health condition. The blood pressure reading 143-85, the oxygen level was 100%, and the heart rate was 96. The 911 team confirmed that he did not have to go to the hospital. Patient confirmed with me that he did talk to his doctor and he was feeling well to go home.

The rash was red and raised, he didn&#39;t think anything of it at the time. The rash persisted and was growing in a linear fashion and seemed to have an unusual appearance. He scheduled a telehealth visit with a Hospital Urgent Care on 12/31/2020. At this time he was diagnosed with Shingles and started on an antiviral. Multiple providers on the telehealth visit think that Shingles is a reaction to the Covid vaccine, as he is otherwise healthy and young and had recently gotten the vaccine. His symptoms are improving and he will be on antivirals for a week total. He denies other symptoms or concerns at this time.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

Rash is red, raised and itchy.  rash appeared approximately 24 hours post vaccine injection. it has now been slightly over a week  and rash is still present. I have been taking Benadryl and Pepcid with some relief. I have also been using Benadryl cream while working.

                                                Started with tingling of the tongue and itchiness of the arms. I took 50mg of Benadryl immediately, but then progressed to hives all over on my, arms, trunk, eyes, ears, and scalp, and legs. Went to the emergency room in case it got worse or obstructed my breathing. In the ER continued to have itching and extreme redness of my arms, with some swelling of my arms as well. About an hour later the Benadryl began working and received prednisone and Pepcid. Stayed in the ER for another hour and my symptoms mostly resolved. Was prescribed 3 days of 40mg prednisone and given an epipen. Have not had issues since then.

He went to the emergency room and was treated with Benadryl and steroids. The following morning he continued to have skin pruritus and developed a few skin lesions. He was also fatigued and had some shortness of breath with exertion. He had Allegra in the home so he was encouraged to take it and  also had been prescribed Benadryl which he could take as needed.

For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

Those stopped by the second day morning (day after vaccine). However, in the second morning ( day after vaccine) I started having pain on left side of neck and on Trapezius muscle on left shoulder blade - and had that pain for three more days. Range of motion for neck restricted for three days. All symptoms improved after four days. I took Lidocaine patch and Tylenol for neck and shoulder blade pain.

The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

A 35-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via intramuscular on the left arm, on 21Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. No history of allergic reactions to any meds (medication) in the past or other vaccines in childhood. Otherwise young healthy male with no history of hypertension. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1686) via intramuscular on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 16:00 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe elevation of blood pressure. On 22Jan2021, at 12:00 AM, after the 2nd dose in left arm, after about 24 to 48 hours, the patient experienced vesicular pruritic erythematous patches in multiple locations of my left arm, left arm pit, left upper back, left chest occurred, peaking on day three and still remain after one week. The blisters have opened leaving behind painful ulcers. This is not a rash that disappears in a few days. It will take much longer than that to heal. No rash with the first dose. Also, with both doses, had severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100 within 2 to 5 hours on 22Jan2021, requiring about 3 doses of clonidine over 7 days where bp would cycle up and down. The seriousness of the events was reported as non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has been not tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events and included Benadryl, mometasone cream and clonidine. The outcome of the events was reported as recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Typical advertised reactions with one exception - Slight numbness/tingling radiating from the inject site - left shoulder. This started about 90 minutes after vaccination. It originated at the injection site and moved down the arm into the left hand. At 120 minutes after injection it moved into the neck, face, ear and scalp - again only on the left side. The following day numbness and tingling sensation is about half as strong. At times it fades and but comes back. Muscle movements were not impacted and sense of touch remained. As of 30 hours after the injection I have not sought out treatment.

At around 11:30pm the night of 4/20/2021, I broke out into hives all over my body but primarily on my legs, hips, arms, armpits, sides, and back of my head.  They were extremely itchy and did not go away while I was awake.  I woke up the next morning, and they had mostly subsided except for some on my arms and around the backs of my knees.  However, shortly after getting out of bed (around 7:30am), they started coming back.  They appeared on my arms and legs, and around the backs of my ears.  It is now 11:30am, and they have mostly subsided again except for a few on my arms and legs.

He states that he has about 30 seconds to know if he is going to pass out. His wife who was right beside the patient said he also he skin turns color as well. I gave him his vaccination. I had him sit in chair to see how he was feeling. He said he was feeling fine. I had him sit about five feet from me in supportive, armed chair. I was preparing to vaccinate his wife. We looked over and his face started turning pale and green. His wife and I immediately went to both his sides to support him and lower his head to his lap. He became conscious about 5-10 seconds later. This all occurred within 3 minutes of the administration of the shot. I gave him a drink. I continued to observe him for 15 minutes until he left. He was alert and fine when leaving the store. I called the patient&#39;s home on April 25, 2021. Patient was at work. I spoke with his wife who said he was feeling fine. I recommended he check in with his doctor regarding second shot.

Second vaccine (04/29/2021), slight headache after about 6 hours?woke up at 2:30am (11 hours after second vaccine) with flush feeling/light sweating but no fever. Triggered my vasovagal syncope (had this happen with other vaccines before so no big deal) to have a heavier heartbeat (about 10-20bpm higher than normal) for about 2 hours. Insomnia until about 6am. Next day 4/30 minor soreness, fatigue, soreness at injection site and ?blah? feeling with headache.  5/1/2021: woke up feeling great, other than soreness in my left arm and armpit area. By noon 5/1 most soreness gone with little to no other symptoms?

                                                First dose: Pain around injection site spread to shoulder. Started within one minute. Kept me awake the first night and lasted 3-4 days on and off. Very intense headache for the first few days. Ears felt funny. Hard to think. Felt like my brain was swollen. It was most intense after the first shot but hasn&#39;t gone away. Head/neck ache; muscle aches; back pain; stomach pain lasted about a week. Wheezing cough has come and gone since the first dose. Brain fog; lightheadedness; dizziness; irritability has not gone away five weeks later. Phantosmia: persistent and distracting olfactory hallucinations. Worst between the first and second doses but hasn&#39;t gone away completely. General inflammation: old injuries hurting, swelling and swollen lymph nodes around my body.  Second dose: Pain in injection arm, lasted only about two days. Flu-like symptoms for the first week. Fatigue; headache; cough; muscle aches; fever; intense nausea. Starting about three days after the second dose, I could barely eat for three or four days. This was similar to when I was on chemotherapy. Fatigue (any physical activity is tiring). Difficult to go to work. If I do, then I have to lie down the entire next day. Any exertion makes all other side effects worse.

                                                Beginning in mid-March, I began to experience psoriasis or eczema like symptoms for the first time in my life. This initially began on my neck, then appeared on my chest and upper eyelids. I?ve seen a dermatologist and they are unsure of the cause only that it?s inflammatory. I was treated with topical tacrolimus, and have had some relief but the itchy, flaking, and redness around my eyes persists most prominently. The chest and neck have mostly cleared up. I?ve also experience significant fatigue.

                                                I began experiencing soreness at injection site and pain in right arm pit approximately 6 hours after vaccination, approximately 4-5PM. Approximately 10 hours after vaccination i felt very fatigued and tired and went to bed early. Approximately 12 hours after vaccination I woke from sleep with fevers (101.8), chills, and headache. I took tylenol, fever subsided,  and was able to return to sleep at approximately  4:00AM. I woke at 6:30AM with headache, dizziness, and fever (99-100).  I took more tylenol and fever and headache subsided. For remainder of day temperature would start in increase, but stayed below 99, and headache would return between doses of tylenol. I slept through the night of 1/9/2021 and woke 1/10/2021 without fever or headache, although I would experience dizziness with exertion above level of walking.  Today, 1/11/2021, I am not experiencing any symptoms.

Couldn&#39;t abduct arm for about 24 hours due to pain.  Very faint red rash a few inches below injection site that goes across arm.  Arm is moderately itchy and has been since Monday 1/18/21.  Arm feels tight and is still pretty sore when reaching out and stretching it above my head.   No redness, itchiness, or discomfort around injection site.  Everything is in the middle of the upper arm.  The itchiness and prolonged soreness are my concerns, considering I still need a 2nd dose.

That mostly disapated after about fours hours sleep that evening.  The headache lasted most the following week, but was tolerable and minor.  I noticed near end of the week following injection that my injection site began to swell a little and turn red, very similar to a white head.  This has continued to be present now still two weeks following.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I started developing  itchy hives and rash on tops of my hands and around my elbows.  Also on my feet and under my armpit.  There are also random hives appearing on different parts of my body.  These symptoms have been happening during daytime hours on 3 separate days so far, starting two days after my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  After taking a cetirizine tablet the rash and hives subside after a couple hours.  Then it starts up again in the morning upon arrival at work.

Woke up morning of 2/19 and observed extensive petechiae and bloody nose consistent with low platelet count and ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). I was previously diagnosed with ITP and platelet count was 262k confirmed by blood work a couple days before 2nd vaccine. Morning after got blood draw confirming platelets dropped to below 1k. Medical emergency and sent to ER. Admitted and received emergency treatment to increase platelet counts. Ended up requiring splenectomy on 2/22/21. Just discharged from hospital. Multiple medical providers advised me to submit report to VAERS.

The rash was very itchy.  Took Benadryl and applied hydro cortisone cream which reduced the rash, but didn&#39;t eliminate in upper groin area.  If it doesn&#39;t subside, I&#39;ll be contacting my primary care.

                                                Stronger pain in area of shot (compared to first dose) Soreness About 14-15 hours after the 2nd dose, I began feeling extremely fatigue. Also developed a slight chills feeling.  At the 21 hour mark, I was exhausted. Felt very weak and stared feeling a little warm. Around hour 22/23, body/bone aches developed.  By 24hrs after the 2nd vaccine, I took 800mg of ibuprofen (to help with the body aches and slight fever) and a Zyrtec for my allergies.  I&#39;m awake and getting ready for work again (I worked through the symptoms yesterday, somehow) approx 34hrs after the 2nd dose. I feel &#34;normal&#34; considering my arm is still sore from the shot. But all other symptoms appear to have subsided; my only tiredness is from waking up early for work.

His eyes started rolling into the back of his head and he was exhibiting shallow breaths. His pupils dilated and he started foaming at the mouth. Pt was lowered to the ground and a full dose of adult epi pen (Lot#0FM406 Exp FEB 2022) was given to the left lateral thigh at 1725. 911 was also called. Pt came to almost immediately. His pupils and breathing returned to baseline. He stayed lying down but was A &amp; O x4. He confirmed that he does not have any allergies, however he has passed out after a vaccine before. Paramedics arrived on scene and took over the encounter. Pt felt much better, however still went with the Paramedics to the ER. Also advised pt to follow up with his PCP in regards to receiving the second vaccine.

Symptoms gradually intensified throughout the day. I started to feel generally fatigued a couple hours following injection. Approximately eight to ten hours post-injection, injection site had fair pain to the touch, but no redness or other discoloration was noted. Moderate soreness in the left arm. I felt very fatigued. No pain medication was taken, I just slept for approximately nine hours. When I woke up before 0700, the arm soreness and pain at the injection site had lessened to mild soreness and minor to light pain at the injection site, but I still felt fatigued. I decided to power through and go to work, and the fatigue had subsided in hours. No further issues.

                                                I was unable to sleep and began to feel significantly overheated by 10 or 11pm the night of my vaccination. To give a sense of the extent of the disturbance, I ended up standing outside for 10 minutes without shoes or socks in the cold night air (~45°F) to cool off, but remained shiftless the rest of the night and was unable to remain asleep for a full sleep cycle until early morning (4 or 5am). I did not take my temperature at any point but did not appear to have a significantly warm forehead. The next morning I woke up with a very sore left shoulder and arm (i.e. the site of my vaccination) and general muscular stiffness in my back. Raising my arm increases the soreness significantly. I have no concerns about my reactions, but they were significant for a first Pfizer COVID shot so I am reporting to provide information to VAERS.

                                                Over the days following my first shot on 3-20-2021, I noticed an increased skin sensitivity to irritants including fragrances and lotions that I normally use. Small hives and mild itchiness on the skin began to develop around 4-1-2021. In the days following the second shot on 4-10-2021, the allergic sensitivity to any substance put on the skin became increasingly severe, especially on the left arm where the shot was administered. The left arm became swollen up to 2 times it&#39;s normal size by 04-14-2021 even after no more cosmetics or foreign substances were being applied to the skin. Hives appeared on other parts of the body but nowhere as severe as the left arm. The left arm skin was inflamed , itchy and painful. Swelling became so severe that doctors found it necessary to presribe topical and oral steroids (prednisone). Oral steroids were effective at reducing inflammation.

I softball size raised red spot surrounded the injection site (slight off center, a bit lower where the injection site is more at the top of the softball sized spot).  The injection site was very itchy, and the large red spot was hard, raised, and itchy.  I looked up what this was and saw that is was extremely similar to &#34;COVID Arm&#34; and saw that is was atypical, but ok and that it should go away in a couple days to weeks.  Which it did, at this point I feel a slight sore tingle around the injection site, but no more red spot or itchiness.

                                                A red rash that is painful to the touch has appeared on a few locations on my skin, each about the size of a silver dollar: (1) on my back at the waist behind my right hip; (2) on the front right upper thigh on the hip joint; (3) upper right groin. They appeared over a week after the first injection so I can&#39;t be completely sure they are related to the vaccine, but it seems like that is possible as I don&#39;t know of any other possible reason for the rash. I&#39;ve had the rash for two days now, so I don&#39;t yet know how long it will last.

After getting out of the shower and laying down my heart was beating 2x as fast throughout the majority of the night and I could feel blood pressure all throughout my body which made my skin unusually warm. Also there was a slight headache nothing too serious. These symptoms lasted for several hours and subsided early morning which contributed to tiredness next day.

Patient reports dizzy spells over the past few days with shortness of breath and then last evening developed a diffuse rash over his chest and extremities associated with itching and burning sensation on 5/1 evening. He denies any nausea,vomiting,abdominal pain,diarrhea.No chest pain or cough.Denies headaches.Denies h/o of prior allergic reaction/concerns to the first dose of the vaccine or any other vaccine.Denies any new exposure other than as stated the 2nd dose of the covid vaccine. Treated with IV steroids, IV Pepcid, and IV Benadryl with improvement. Upon discharge, directed to continue Prednsione 40mg daily for three more days for a total of five days of steroids, and follow-up with PCP. SUBSEQUENTLY, returned to ER  acute onset of decreased visual acuity, diffuse arthralgias, joint pain, myalgias, lightheadedness, palpitations, vertigo, muscle spasms, and difficulty moving both upper extremities. This was accompanied by sharp, 10 out of 10, nonradiating, diffuse anterior chest pressure. Nothing made this better or worse. The patient was driving at that time, and was unable to control his arms, which resulted in his vehicle leaving the roadway.  He was able to bring the vehicle to a stop before crashing. Since then, his symptoms have gradually improved, although they have not completely resolved. The characteristics are identical to the events that led to his previous admission.

                                                After his first dose, my husband told me he had the regular soreness that you get from shots in his arm at the injection site, but ever since tells me that he&#39;s had soreness from the chest up to his head as well as a persistent headache on the right side of his forehead. He&#39;s said rest has helped ease it some, but the symptoms have not dissipated within the &#34;normal&#34; time. There have not been any extreme side effects.

First night, it was very difficult to sleep - I did not get much. Dizziness was like being very drunk. Now every night laying down in bed looking up is dizzying, some nights worse than others but not as bad as first night of symptoms. This has been persistent for about a week. Some temporary dizziness when reorienting head quickly during the day, particularly looking up or down, but mainly worse at night in the dark, not debilitating. Sleeping with some low lights on helps reduce spinning feeling. Mild headache and tight neck/shoulders starting 9 days after injection but may be unrelated.

I could not sleep most of the rest of the night. When I got out of bed at 7:30AM, my neck was sore and I took my temperature and it was 100.7 degrees. I took two Tylenol and by 3PM on May 9 I felt better. By the next day (today) I feel fine - just a little tired from not sleeping much Saturday night.

A 36-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06Apr2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm from 16Mar2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not diagnose with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was very sick for 4 days: fevers which came and went, chills, sweats, nausea, loss of appetite, light headedness, lack of energy. As a result of his immune system being weakened, he wound up with Cellulitis which he was still fighting over 3 weeks after the shot. As the patient was normally a healthy male, it was strange that he would wind up with a bacterial infection. The patient also stated that after the second dose he experienced cellulitis in his left leg to thigh area. He went to emergency room for scan and to rule out clot. He thought he was immunocompromised and that was why he got the cellulitis in the leg. Caller wanted to get the compensation information to help with the bills. The events onset date was 06Apr2021 17:00. 2 rounds of antibiotics was received for the events. The events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ultrasound with unknown result. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                I woke up before normal time to go to the bathroom at about 5:00AM. Part of the way through urination, I started experiencing dizziness, which didn&#39;t feel abnormal for having got out of bed/upright quickly. By the end of urination, the dizziness had come to an uncomfortable level, and faintness began to set in. I leaned on the sink to hold my body up, before trying to return to bed. I blacked out (probably very briefly) and resumed consciousness when my face hit the bathroom  door as I fell. I was almost immediately fully aware of my surroundings and what had happened after I resumed consciousness. Although I felt no further symptoms, I remained on the floor on my back for 3-5 mins before getting up and back to bed. Other than soreness at the injection site, which is gone this morning (May 15), no additional symptoms returned.

While I was changing, I noticed a diffuse maculopapular rash on my torso back thighs and upper arms.  The rash was very pruritic.  I took some Benadryl which did not seem to help the itchiness and made me sleepy.  By Thursday, most of the rash on the torso was gone, but the rash had spread more to my forearms, lower legs, feet and hands.  There was some mild edema of the hands, I had some mild fatigue, and temperature check was slightly elevated around 99 degrees F.   By Friday, most of the rash was gone and I had some remaining itchiness of feet and hands.  Saturday I was back to normal.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

                                                My son had the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday February 27th. Today, 6 days later, he woke up with a rash all over his body. I suspect the vaccine. I gave him a Xyzal this morning, but did not do anything to diminish the rash. I am not sure if he should get the second dose due March 20th. Have you heard of a delayed rash happening days later and how long this might last? Please let me know or forward to someone who knows.

Approximately 48-72 hours after injection, patient experienced left eye pain and developed a non-itch-inducing rash in left temple.  Following after this period, eye pain worsened, as did the size of rash (stretching from temple to back of left ear - along the V1 nerve).  Patient was diagnosed with Shingles and is now receiving treatment for that virus.  It is theorized that the vaccine induced an immune response to attack the novel virus, and left its guard down for the dormant Herpes Zoster virus.

I have never experience this before and the only change in my history was the vaccine. Today I was out in the sun again for 30 minutes with 30SPF on and my entire body got sunburnt today and sun poisoning again after only the 30 minutes in the sun. The only places that are red and itchy are places exposed to the sun.

                                                Only symptom experienced during first ~36 hours after receiving vaccine was soreness near injection area of left arm.   A couple hours after falling as sleep the second night after vaccination shot (Sunday night), I woke up very cold / severe shivering. After several hours I managed to fall asleep for approximately another 1-2 hours. The next day I experienced fever, shivers, general body weakness/fatigue, and muscle aches/discomfort especially in both legs. These symptoms lasted throughout the day.  That night (Monday night), when I got into bed, I was strongly shivering. I managed to fall asleep for 1-2 hours, but woke up uncomfortably warm. I was unable to fall back asleep until 4-5 hours later. I woke up 1-2 hours later, with most of my body dripping with sweat, and the sheets rather damp.  Tuesday and Wednesday: Symptoms came and went, mostly feelings of fever, chills, general fatigue, lost appetite, and mild light headedness. Sleeping remained difficult, able to stay asleep for &lt;4 hours each night.    As of today (Thursday), fever has subsided. Still generally feel fatigued, occasionally lightheaded.

I approached him and asked if he was alright and gently tapped his shoulder. He did not respond. I spoke louder, he did not respond. I shook his shoulder and spoke very loudly, he opened his eyes and rolled his head around and told me that he felt really dizzy. His skin was warm and he was sweating. He reported that he was breathing fine, that he just felt dizzy and hot. Over the next 5 minutes his dizziness decreased. He reported that the site of vaccination felt numb. Vaccination site did not show any redness or signs of local reaction. He reported that he was still breathing fine. His dizziness continued to decrease, and 25 minutes after the vaccine he reported that he did not feel dizzy anymore.  He asked for some water, which I gave him. He stayed sitting in the chair until an hour after the vaccine. He got up and walked around and reported feeling no more dizziness and that he felt fine driving home.

I was prescribed Fexofenadine (1 tablet by mouth every morning for 10 days) and triamcinolone (apply to affected areas for two weeks Monday through Friday). The rash slowly reduced from being severely itchy to mild itchiness, and some hyper pigmentation and reduced swelling after a week of appearing.

There is a photo attached to the message. APRN reviewed the message and picture and feels it is uncommon to develop a rash after the COVID vaccine. He can take benadryl and Pepcid to help. APRN will also send out a new prescription to increase patient&#39;s Acyclovir to 800 mg PO BID. Patient does not have a PCP to evaluate his skin at this time so it was recommended to him to go to the Urgent Care to be evaluated for shingles.  Patient verbalized his understanding.

Symptoms responded well to Excedrin at regular intervals, although never completely went away that day. Woke up the second day feeling mostly better, although still very drowsy, fatigued, and weak for most of the day. Fever came back around 11pm, up to about 99.8 degrees, but after taking Excedrin it went away pretty quickly. Woke up feeling generally ok the third day following the vaccine, but started to get a low fever (98.8 degrees) around 2pm. Took Excedrin and feel much better.

The rash got significantly worse over the next 2 days so I scheduled a tele-doc appointment. He confirmed the rash was Shingles. I had a mild case of chicken pox as a child and I am only 37 so it was surprising to get Shingles. While I cannot say if it is related to the vaccine, I wanted to make sure it was reported.

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Report  May 8th, 2021. Patient, had an appointment for his 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine May 8th 2021 at 10:00am. His first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 was at our Pharmacy on April 16th, 2021. At around 10:15am, patient came in with his fiancé, who is a doctor at pediatric department, shown on her name tag. After processing the paperwork needed for vaccination, Pharmacist on duty, went over the VAR to ensure the provided information was adequate before it was ready for my intern to administer the shot. Patient looked fine as I was able to have a brief conversation with him while waiting for the shot. Due to some insurance issues that needed to be resolved, at 10:40am, pharmacy intern, took the patient to Patient Health Room for immunization. At 10:45am, I was ringing up a prescription at Terminal 42 when hearing the word, Help, coming from the Patient Health Room. Within seconds later, the door was opened as I was running out the pharmacy toward the Patient Health Room to see what happened. The patient was lying on the floor, unconscious, while his fiancé was calling his name asking whether he was okay and rolled him to his side and supported his head. I reached into the cabinet and prepared to administer an EPIPEN to the patient, meanwhile, pharmacy technicians, asked and dialed 911. As his fiancé kept calling his name, the patient gained consciousness. I asked intern what had happened to clarify whether it was a reaction due to the vaccination or not. Meanwhile, the patient&#39;s fiancé stated this event was not unexpected. Patient was able to talk and confirmed he was fine. Unfortunately, it appeared that the patient bruised his nose and forehead with slight blood from a minor cut. We instructed the patient and his fiancé to stay in the room and offered assistance upon request until EMS arrived. Patient&#39;s fiancé requested an ice pack for his bruise. Later on, the patient appeared to be shaking, so I asked the fiancé whether it was okay to give him some GATORADE. His fiancé also requested a glucose meter to check his blood sugar. The EMS arrived within minutes and patient was transported to hospital Before they were leaving, I asked the fiancé if there was anything she would like us to do as well as offered a follow-up. She declined the offer. I also asked briefly if she could share his medical condition, but the fiancé only disclosed that the patient has needle anxiety. The EMS also said that they will take it from here, and there is no additional action needed from our end at this time. Each team members who were involved in the event wrote reports and kept them filed in the pharmacy records.

                                                After almost a week after getting my first shot, I started noticing cold sores in mouth which are still present (Been more than a month now). After my second dose on 4/21/2021, I started seeing weird acne on my nose. Also seeing some acne on my back and some on my stomach. The acne seems to be self healing but causes lot of skin irritation/itching. Also, just one week before 5/17/2021, I started noticing that I have several inflammations/sores under foreskin on my penis and some pus around the back of the penis&#39;s head. This is causing excessive itching on my penis and causing discomfort during sleep. I am uncircumcised adult.

A contactable consumer (mother) and a contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 37-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 07May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0168) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included adult-onset diabetes developed just a few years ago that was controlled with a pill. He was not a insulin diabetic patient and unknown renal disorder Concomitant medication included metformin taken for diabetes; lisinopril taken for diabetes as to protect kidneys. He had his first vaccine on Friday evening of this last week and by Monday he was in the ER, 90% of his body has a rash on it, and it looked out as he poured some hot water on him, it&#39;s over like 45% of his body, his toes and his legs. He went to an urgent care, walk-in and that&#39;s very itchy and so they sent him over to look in hospital and they put him on steroids and Benadryl and anti-itchy cream (Treatment), he was missing work because he had got this rash all over his body. The event was also reported as hives covering over 50% of body that randomly come and go. Events were started from May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood sugar monitor continuously which was tested on machine. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Rash and hives break out.  It started on my arms and spread to my chest, side, back, upper buttocks, and thighs.  It started in the evening the night after I got my 2nd shot.  I had a headache, probably had a fever (didn&#39;t check my temp) and was achey all night long.  That first night into the following morning, the rash got worse and was super itchy.  It was worse that next night (Tuesday night into Wed morning).  I got Benadryl Wed morning and took it that day and Thursday night, which helped reduce the rash.  I didn&#39;t take it Friday as I felt 100% but the rash came back Friday night.  I went to urgent care that Sat and got prescribed some Prednizone for 5 days.   Took that for the following week and it helped as well.  By the next Wednesday, I was 100% and the rash had gone away.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, May 18, 2021 at 1:53pm EDT. Many of the &#34;typical&#34; or &#34;expected&#34; side effects commenced about 12 hours later, including chills, night sweats, a slight fever (99.5), and headache and lethargy the following day.   Nothing was particularly off-putting until the afternoon of Wednesday, May 19, 2021, when I noticed small red spots on my legs and feet. A Google search suggested petechiae and enough cause for me to go to a nearby urgent care clinic. The petechiae were present on both legs and feet (and eventually a few spots on my hands), though a little more pronounced on the left side (with one noteworthy cluster on my left leg). I had no apparent gum bleeding or bruising (maybe one bruise, but the urgent care doctor thought it was there beforehand).  The doctor at the urgent care clinic confirmed petechiae and ran stat blood work for return that night. At ~9pm EDT on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, I received a phone call from the urgent care&#39;s centralized lab informing me that my platelet count was 2 (10^3/uL) -- dangerously low, with risk of spontaneous bleeding and in the worst case scenario brain hemorrhage -- and my PTT was 55.6 seconds. They told me to report to an emergency room immediately, the nearest of Medical Center.  The diagnosis was eventually Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). Every physician I&#39;ve encountered has felt that the occurrence one-day post-vaccination points to the vaccine as the cause. (For what it&#39;s worth, I do not think any of the doctors or nurses I encountered had never seen a platelet count so low. Most of them said as much.) My discharge papers officially note as the diagnoses: petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and adverse effect of vaccine.  I have included details related to my platelet count, treatment course, and other figures below (and am happy to provide corroborating information where appropriate). The doctors did not run any d-dimers, PF4 HIT ELISA, or fibrinogen tests, and no imaging was performed, presumably because I did not present with any signs of simultaneous clotting (e.g., TTP or VITT). They&#39;ve also told me that my haptoglobin and hemoglobin levels were normal (see below), which I am told helps support the notion that there was / is no clotting or &#34;red blood cell breakdown.&#34;  Search terms: decreased platelet count, immune thrombocytopenia, ITP, severely low platelet count, low platelets, petechiae, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia, vaccine-induced ITP

According to the patient&#39;s brother, the person administering the vaccine went in at an angle that is not 90 degrees and therefore did not administer the vaccine correctly and caused injury to the person they vaccinated.

The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol.

When I came back around 4pm I was feeling okay, no sore on the injection site, unlike my regularly flu vaccines that I mostly feel sore at injection site which lasts about few hours immediately after the flu shot, so it was sort of surprising to see that but later that night, my body starts feeling weak, aches and a tangling on my feet, as the night progresses up to the early morning, I was unusually fatigued and lightheaded with the regression of the muscle aches and subsequently other symptoms started disappearing, notably, I started feeling soreness on the injection site, which lingered to the next day.

A 38-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, lot no. EH9899, expiration date not reported) intramuscular on left arm on 28Dec2020 at a single dose, then second dose (lot no. EK9231, expiry date not reported), intramuscular on right arm on 18Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: penicillin. (no major history of allergic reactions except penicillin as a baby). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that on 11Jan2021 15:00 (03:00 PM) &#34;exactly two weeks after taking the first shot, my body broke out in systematic rash and welts with swelling of face. My doctor thought two weeks was two long of a delay for the reaction to be from the vaccine. My doctor thought it might have been some antibiotics I had been on and they gave me prednisone. The prednisone cleared up the reaction before the second shot. I received the second shot (on 18Jan2021 with lot no. EK9231, intramuscular on right arm) and within two hours I had an even worse systematic allergic reaction that is still on going as of today 04Feb2021. The Prednisone is not clearing up the reaction. I am going to have to take short term disability.&#34; The adverse events resulted to patient had clinic visit, disability or permanent damage. Patient took prednisone, famotidine, hydroxyzine, and XANAX (because of the prednisone) as treatments. The vaccine was given in the hospital. No other vaccines were given in four weeks.  Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported allergic reaction manifested with &#34;systematic rash and welts with swelling of face&#34; and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Next day the muscle aches were all over but not as bad, but a severe headache all day. Treated with tylenol all day along with ibuprofen &#43; tylenol at night. The next day I felt fine, however noticed a baseball sized lump under my left armpit about 60 hours after the shot in my left shoulder. Internet says it&#39;s a swollen lymph node and known side effect. The next morning the swelling went down significantly and after another day it seems to be getting better.

                                                I experienced the normal moderate soreness after both injections as well as the expected mild flu like symptoms for about a day after the second injection.  The primary reason i am reporting an adverse effect is that I am still experiencing mild soreness in the shoulder muscle into which the vaccine was injected.  Occasionally, this soreness seems to be present in the other muscles of my upper arm as well.  This mild soreness has persisted and been very consistent ever since the initial moderate soreness from the first injection subsided about 2 months ago.  I have not experienced this type of lingering soreness following any previous vaccination.

                                                I woke up just after midnight scratching furiously my entire body though mostly from the waist down. I noticed breaking out in hives on my legs. I had scratched so hard while sleeping that I broke the skin and was bleeding. Through a combination of benadryl and topical otc lotions the hives went down after 8 hours and gone within 24 hours. I still have moderate itching from the waist down which I never experienced prior to my second shot. I use otc lotion throughout the day and still continue to itch. I will at times use benadryl is the itching gets uncontrolled.

                                                Arm hurt at injection site, upon lifting arm, felt a sensation in arm near injection site and had what appeared to be a seizure that lasted around 10-15 seconds. A few moments later another seizure occurred. Resulted in a hospital visit and a follow-up with a neurologist.

It made it really hard to sleep.  I woke up the next day on 3/28  feeling extremely fatigued with a bit of body ache.  I then took two more Advils that day.  By the 3rd day on 3/29  I was back to normal, with the exception of a tingly sensation on my left-hand (note i received the shot on my left arm/shoulder area).

Heart rate and blood pressure elevated quickly. Rash on chest and neck.   Within two-three minutes of shot I received Epi Shot and Benadryl shot. Sent to ER and received IV, steroid and Pepcid.

                                                Hives on back of left hand approximately 1.5 hours after dosage. Took an over the counter anti-histamine and rash subsided within an hour. Rash never came back. However 2-3 days after the shot I have a non-spreading rash around my knees. Not hives, but raises red bumps aligned with hair follicles. Rash is itchy randomly through the day.

                                                After the first dose, I experienced only mild fatigue and a mild headache within a couple hours of the injection. Later within 10 hours, I developed strong injection site direness that affected my sleep but abated within 12 hours. Therefore, I was expecting more or less similar symptoms with the second dose. Instead, I felt absolutely nothing for nearly twelve hours until I fondly felt mild injection site soreness. I went to bed around 1 am. At around 2 am I awoke with such strong chills that they were almost like convulsions. I was sweating and had a headache.  More concerning though was the tachypnea and wheezing. I was wheezing as if I had asthma to the point that my lunch?s were whistling and I found it difficult to take sufficient breaths. This lasted 30 minutes to one hour before a sting enough that I fell asleep again, still with mild left arm soreness, sweating, mild fever, headache and wheezing. When I awoke a few hours later at around 8 am, I was so fatigued that I could not move. I had a mild headache still but the breathing was better without wheezing and now only hampered by frequent belching (passing off the CO2 buildup from the tachypnea most likely). However, I was so exhausted that I lay in bed for another four hours. When I forced myself up to shower and move, I had a sudden severe depressive attack of uncontrollable crying in the shower. I also had body aches throughout the morning. These symptoms are the same or similar to those felt when I had COVID, so I knew them and that they should pass, yet I did not expect them to be so strong  and the tachypnea with wheezing was initially very disconcerting until it began to ease.  By approximately 11 hours later,  all symptoms had passed.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine last Thursday (4/8) at 9am. I did not have any immediate side effects -- just mild soreness at the injection site in my right arm approximately 8 hours later (I&#39;m left-handed), which subsided by the next morning. However, at approximately 3am on Friday (4/9), I woke up with a fair amount of discomfort in all of the fingers in my left (dominant) hand. It felt like what I would imagine someone suffering from arthritis might feel; I got up to take some ibuprofen and I had difficulty grasping the doorknob, for example. The pain mostly subsided by the time I woke back up, although there was some very minor continued stiffness in my left index finger, which also eventually seemed to go away after a few days.  Fast forward to this morning (4/13) and I woke up around 5am with renewed discomfort and stiffness in my left index finger, requiring ibuprofen. It is now ~3:45pm and the discomfort remains slightly, but has mostly subsided. I should add that I&#39;ve never experienced this before the vaccine, and I cannot think of anything I did differently in the last week other than receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  I reported this event today to my primary care physician, but have not sought additional treatment.

On Saturday, 4/10/21 I started noticing  hive on my upper arms, upper legs and forearms. Took claritan and they disappeared after 4 hours. That night at 9pm they started to show up in different places. In the morning they were on my forearms, knees, body. I took more claritan and went on a 12 mile hike. As I hiked they got worse and then, about 2pm they had disappeared significantly from knees and forearms. Took a shower at the house around 4 and saw hives all along torso, shoulders and upper arms. Took 2 Benadryl?s around 5 and it all seemed to disappear. In the morning, 4/12/21, went to work and saw that hives were only on my hands, and my hands were now swollen too. Perhaps too much sun on my hands, didn?t sunblock them well. Took another Benadryl at 6am, no effect. At work put Benadryl cream on hands, no effect.  At noon, took a claritan no effect. Hives never left hands today. At end of day, some hives traveling up forearms.  Took a Benadryl and crashed for the night. Hands still have hives and swollen. Palms swollen.

                                                On 3/27 I was diagnosed with gout following pain, redness, and swelling in my left foot. I also had pain in my shoulder. The next day I started developing a rash on the right side of my torso on my chest and back. In a follow up appointment with the doctor and a visit to the ER I was diagnosed shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and indomethicin. The rash has mostly cleared, but pain in both my torso and foot still persists.

                                                hives all over; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 38-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP6955, expiration date: 30Jun2021) via an unspecified route of administration in the arm right on 05Apr2021 11:16 AM as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma since he was born and eye surgery from 05Mar2021. Concomitant medications included prednisolone acetate from 05Mar2021 after eye surgery. The patient previously received (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6202, expiration date: Jun2021) on 15Mar2021 11:16 AM at 38 years old for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received his second Covid 19 vaccine on 05Apr2021 and the hives started on 08Apr2021. The patient had hives all over. The hives did get worse overnight. The patient had gotten hives when he was younger but it was a reaction to a plant. The hives he had currently have not gone away even with a shower or taking Benadryl. He took 2 25mg tablets of Benadryl within an hour of each other yesterday, 08Apr2021. Then about 9 hours later he took 2 more 25mg tablets. He was going to sleep so he thought the Benadryl (lot number: SEF004, expiry date: Dec2021) would help with that. The patient had no questions except if her husband needed to go to the doctor. The AEs did not required a visit to Emergency Room, no physician office. The patient had no Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Outcome of the events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Took two benadryl in the evening as well as one Zyrtec.  The welts and swelling on arms had subsided by morning (still visible though) but was stronger on legs.  Developed swelling in hands and arm overnight as well.  Taking more benadryl today and monitoring to see if further treatment is needed.

A few weeks later, without any known cause, my hearing had suddenly changed; audio was distorted and there was severe tinnitus. Upon visiting my ENT and receiving a hearing test, I was diagnosed with cochlear hydrops and prescribed a 10-day regimen of prednisone, along with recommendations for stress management/mitigation, a low-sodium diet, and reduced caffeine/alcohol consumption.

I was unconscious for 30 seconds, and while unconscious my eyes started to role to the back of my head. When I became alert I was on the floor and I couldn?t breathe! While on the floor gasping for air I vomited twice! 911 was called and an EKG was done on site! It showed that my heart rate was low, and I was transported to hospital ER department. Multiple test were done on me and everything came back perfect! No high blood pressure, not a diabetic, and no Permanent head damage.

                                                I developed a few red spots on the right side of my chest and shoulder on Thursday, May 6th.  The red spots grew, began to develop blisters and multiplied over the next few days. On Tuesday, May 11th I saw APRN, NP-C at the clinic. She diagnosed me as having shingles. She prescribed Valacyclovir HCL 1Gm for 7 days and Gabapentin 300mg tablets to use as needed. At the time, she did not feel that it was related to the vaccine. On May 13th, I returned to the clinic as the Shingles had got progressively worse and was seen by doctor, who is doing a residence under M.D. Both doctor&#39;s felt that the vaccine could have contributed to the diagnosis. They prescribed Prednisone 30mg for 3 days, 20mg for 3 days, and 10mg for 3 days, as well as 3 more days of Valacyclovir HCL 1Gm. At this time the blisters are getting smaller and the rash is subsiding and beginning to scab over in places.

At this time its confined to the injection arm. Over the next week nerve pain and numbness spread to left side of face, both arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, toes. physical therapist confirms elbow lymph node on injection arm swelling, hands turning red extreme pain and swelling, loss of feeling. nerve pain in the entire body, nerve and muscle spasms in all parts of body. Fingers and does burning at the tips feel like a string is cutting off circulation. Visibly red. Around the 4 week mark, fully unable to lift legs or arms, left half of face numb, zap/jots seizure like hitting my body. go to ER seemingly becoming paralyzed,  within hours strength of legs returns but with numb feet/toes. no diagnosis other than peripheral neuropathy. neck begins to swell, hurts to swallow, throat closing. trying to sleep, throat closed, wake up, completely unable to open throat cant breath. throat episodes lasted about 5 days and resolved. complete insomnia and 24/7tinitus. any attempt to sleep or become tired results in heavy body zaps like hooked to a tenz unit. can&#39;t use hands or type, arm to hand seized nerves, feel like shrunken or contracted nerves. PCP prescribes benzos to sleep. this allows some sleep with waking every hour. over the following weeks symptoms seem to improve slowly but still debilitating. today at week 8&#43; since one shot only, I am able to type again, but with nerve pain and numbness in all fingers. loud tinnitus, numbness in all limbs, episodes of extreme debilitating muscle fatigue come in waves, almost unable to stand agonizing muscle fatigue and nerve zapping. These full body muscle episodes only seem to come in waves of 24 hours, then seem to feel recovering, only to relapse again. injection site pain seems to have wrapped around to the bicep 24/7 pain. unsure if this is nerve or muscle. 3 ER visits, PCP visits, blood tests, no help. I cannot work, constant nerve firing muscle spasms and nerve pain and episodes of weakness so bad you cannot sit without agonizing pain. I am disabled from this and still searching for help

                                                On 5/16/2021 I had a small red spot on the back of my right calf, it looked like a mosquito bite but it was too large like the size of a quarter, it was painful, then it grew the size of my calf, I was afraid it was a blood clot. I went to the emergency room and they ran a sonogram and they said it was cellulitis or skin infection. They gave me antibiotics.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I felt myself get very flushed and slightly lightheaded.  This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

                                                rash on his arm/has grown and was now a little bit itchy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician (patient). A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK5730, expiry date unknown) intramuscular at right arm on 20Dec2020 around 09:30 at single dose for Covid-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient received Covid 19 vaccine 8 days ago (20Dec2020 around 09:30) and 5 days ago (Dec2020) he noticed a rash on his arm. The patient informed that he was not even sure if this was about the COVID-19 vaccine or if he has just associated it with it, but the rash has grown and was now a little bit itchy (Dec2020). The patient clarified that his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine was on 20Dec2020 and he had onset of rash about 23Dec2020 or 24Dec2020, he was not exactly sure. The outcome of the event rash on his arm/has grown and was now a little bit itchy was not recovered. The reporter causality was unknown, with the information he has obtained and the conversation he just had with the inbound transfer agent it seemed a very low, slight likelihood that there was a causality relationship.

                                                A few hours after injection, I began having discomfort in my left shoulder, the location of the injection.  Over the following next few hours I began to have overall body aches and pains in my joints.  My skin became extremely sensitive to the touch, a very strange hard to describe sensation.  I then began to get the chills, and running a fever.  Ultimately my fever spiked at 104 degrees.   I took a cold bath to bring the fever down, and for the rest of the night seesawed back and forth with fever using cold compresses and no sheets on my bed to keep my fever down.  I also took one 200 Mg Ib-Profen.  At roughly 26 hours after the injection, I no longer have a fever, but the body aches persist.

A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 25Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s prior vaccinations included tetanus shot on 09Feb2021. On 28Mar2021, 2 days after taking the first dose, the patient experienced reactions from the vaccine which included Itchiness on the abdomen area, knees, and toes and disorientation and went to emergency room for treatment. The patient wanted to know whether these are normal side effects of the vaccine. Upon follow-up on 28Mar2021, the patient reported that he felt weird after receiving the vaccine and lightheadedness. He told the nurse that he didn&#39;t eat before getting the vaccine. And wasn&#39;t sure if getting the vaccine was like having blood drawn so he hadn&#39;t eaten anything. The nurse told him he might be feeling lightheaded because he didn&#39;t eat and she gave him some lollipops and the patient felt much better. The patient also stated that on 28Mar2021, he was feeling overwhelmed and cannot describe the feeling. It was like itchy or pins and needles all over his body. The patient felt like he was going to pass out, as he as disoriented. The patient stated that he went to the Emergency Department. They kept him overnight, checked his heart, did some blood work, checked his blood sugar, gave him a Covid 19 test. The patient stated that everything came back normal. The Emergency Department concluded that the events could be due to the Covid 19 vaccine and described that his system was fighting the Covid 19 vaccine or something. The patient was asking if this is normal. He was also asking for a copy of this safety report for work purposes. The patient went to the Emergency Department on 28Mar2021 (around 7pm) and was in observation overnight. He was discharged from the Emergency Department this morning, 29Mar2021 at around 11:00AM. The patient confirmed that he was not hospitalized. The patient stated that he may be overthinking about the events and really paying attention to his body. He thinks he needs to rest as he was in the Emergency Department for a long time. The patient lab test included Blood sugar test. The outcome of the events was resolved for dizziness, unknown for feeling abnormal and overwhelmed and not resolved for other events.  Information on lot/batch number obtained. Additional information has been requested.

Initially visited the Urgent Care on April 1, 2021, initially the doctors thought it was dermatitis. The symptoms started to improve in the next two weeks. The second dose was applied on April 10, 2021, after the application the same rashes reappeared on the skin in a more evident way and spread to the legs. It also spread further on the arms, back and face / face (on the face it was not as invasive / aggressive as on the arms and back). I visited Urgent Care again on April 15, 2021 and that was where they indicated that it was an adverse effect to the vaccine. The diagnosis Shingles (Measles).

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine my blood pressured dropped considerably (it was measured at 77 by medical staff), I started sweating profusely, and briefly was unable to speak because I felt dizzy and felt as if I had no energy. After a few minutes, I recovered and my blood pressure resumed to normal (114). As this was happening, my partner-- who was with me when I experienced the allergic reaction--observed that my face suddenly became red and flushed (a minute after getting vaccination).  Medical staff did not  need to administer an Epipen. They had me lie down and breathe. After about 15-20 minutes I felt normal. Medical staff had me wait a total of 30 minutes before releasing me.

I am a nephrologist practicing in my area.  10 days or so  after receiving Pfizer vaccine I started noticing left leg swelling and some redness. I didn&#39;t pay attention to it because I thought this could be a muscle or tendon issues because of my exercise. But the swelling did not go away, however, it decreased overtime with leg elevation, etc but when I checked my leg I found out that I have a DVT.   I am a healthy 39 ( when I received the vaccine but I am 40  now). I don&#39;t smoke. No family history.  I am on a blood thinner now.   I need to report this as I think that it is important to be reported.   I read in the news that a 40 year-old man was diagnosed with DVT after Pfizer vaccine  Please call or email if you need further info

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm left on 16Feb2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN 5318) (at the age of 39-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included none. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included desvenlafaxine succinate (PRISTIQ) 50 mg ER taken for an unspecified indication, from an unknown start date (two weeks prior to vaccination). The patient previously received BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot Number: EN 5318) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 26Jan2021 at 12:00 for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On the day when patient received second dose on 16Feb2021 at 21:00, he felt strong soreness at the injection site (left arm) and began feeling chills by the time he went to bed (12 hours after receiving the vaccine), but no other symptoms. On the following day (17Feb2021) when he woke up, he experienced a multitude of symptoms, including headache, sore muscles throughout my body, alternating sense of hot/cold, and general fatigue. These symptoms continued most of the day but began to subside by that evening. No treatment was given for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered on 18Feb2021.

Fever dropped to high 99&#39;s, body aches subsided, and skin soreness was gone almost completely. But a new dull, but persistent headache was there. &#43;36hrs I started getting the chills again around 8PM on the second day and my fever rose to 100.6º &#43;48hrs I woke up feeling like nothing ever happened aside from some slight soreness around the injection site.

                                                I had pain at the injection site the evening of receiving the injection, which still continues, though not too bad. Walking up today at around 7 am, I felt headache, achy all over, weakness, and some fever. I decided to stay home. I lay in bed most of the day, sometimes sleeping, sometimes watching YouTube videos on my phone. I was feeling kind of cold, so I snuggled completely under the covers, head and all. I got sweaty and had to uncover my head. I changed clothes. I got up a couple of times to urinate. Once, I felt some weakness, and had to support myself with my hand on the edge of the bathroom counter. Then, this afternoon, my headache was a bit worse. I got up to hop top the bathroom. I was urinating standing up, when I started feeling weak, so I supported myself with my hand, but almost immediately, I started feeling like I was going to fall, to faint, and to vomit. I hurriedly sat down on the toilet. I was still feeling nauseated and weak, so I learned back to take pressure off my abdomen, which was feeling slightly bloated. The bathroom fan was on, so it felt rather cold, but I started getting hotter and hotter, sweating profusely. At the same time, I just sat there trying to recover, and started feeling pins and needles in my forearms, but not like they had fallen asleep, just like someone were pressing down on my arms with blunt needles. I thought I was going to have to crawl back to bed.  After a while, I started cooling off and feeling a little better. I went back to my room and changed clothes. I&#39;m feeling warm and a bit weak and achy again, but nothing like that. I had only drunk 3 cups of water today, though I drank about 7 yesterday.

By 4-28-2021, several clusters of sensitive and itchy red bumps appeared in my right armpit, on the back of my right shoulder, and right pectoral. Symptoms persist as of today, waiting to be seen by a doctor. It appears like shingles. I have had chicken pox as a child, and have not ever had shingles or the shingles vaccine.

                                                Approximately two weeks after the first does, I started to experience itchiness and puffiness of the skin around my left eye.  The condition still exists today and I&#39;m starting to notice it happening around my right eye.  The skin will become dry and eventually flake if I do not put Vaseline on it.  I did mention this condition to my medical provider during my routine physical and he thinks it is allergy related.  He said to sparingly put a Cortisone cream on it, which seems to help.    The day after the second dose, I experienced body aches.

The patient&#39;s medical history was none and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 13Apr2021, the patient experienced soreness and hurting at the injection site and mentioned right arm pain and burning getting pretty unbearable; and that pain was radiating from arm down to forearm.

                                                I had had a very small sebaceous cyst on my right cheekbone for about 3 years prior to my covid Pfizer vaccination.  After the 1st dose, it seemed to grow slightly, and following the 2nd dose, it hardened and enlarged to the size of a blueberry in about a week or so.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  But I just thought I should report it, since it is now enlarged and red, and will require minor outpatient surgery later this month to remove.

                                                12 Hours after my Husband&#39;s second Pfizer shot, he laid down and became incredibly lethargic, confused, delirious, achy, nauseous, and feverish, with shaking and chills.  He collapsed when walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night, saying he couldn&#39;t breath.  He was okay once he laid back down.  He stayed in bed for 36 hours.  5 days later he is still fatigued, achy, and has headaches and eye strain, with intense pain in his arm, and a rash covering his body.

Exactly 5 days later (Sunday May 9th) I started to develop a hive like itchy rash on the inside fore-arm of the opposite arm to which I got vaccinated.  A few days later I developed a similar but more extensive hive like itchy rash on my stomach to the right hand side to the front.  The rash is still visible and itchy now (2 weeks post 1st shot).  As of today I am treating the itchy discomfort with calamine spray and I took Benadryl Allergy antihistamine 50mg to see if that helps.

                                                Initially developed a few itchy hives on my right outer calf on 5/13. It became widespread from my knee to my ankle by 5/16. On 5/17 smaller itchy bumps had spread to my stomach and chest and I was evaluated by PCP, who directed me to take Zyrtec and apply Eucerin. By 5/19 smaller itchy bumps had spread to my arms, and my right ankle and foot had started swelling. PCP prescribed a course of antibiotics as a precaution.  By 5/21 rash had spread to my back and continued in all other locations. On 5/21 dermatologist prescribed oral steroids (prednisone) and topical triamcinolone.   Swelling in leg subsided after a few days. Itching was reduced but still present through to June 1.
