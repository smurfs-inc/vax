                                                The day after receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine, my son broke out in a rash all over his body. The rash was worse on the arm where he got the shot and on his hands and feet than on the rest of his body, but it was pretty much all over. He hadn&#39;t seen the new doctor listed on his insurance yet, and she refused to see him because she does not see new patients online and refused to see a patient with a rash in person because she said it could be a COVID symptom. There is no way he had COVID as he hadn&#39;t gone anywhere in months due to the pandemic and going to school online. The rest of our household had been previously vaccinated for COVID. We called the nurse helpline and a friend who is a physician&#39;s assistant. Both told us to give him Benadryl, which we did. It took 3 days before the rash disappeared. He had about another 3 days with no rash before it came back just on his hands, including the palms of his hands. We gave Benadryl again and the rash went away 2 days later and hasn&#39;t come back so far.

Still has difficulty focusing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father). A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: ER2613 and expiry: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 31Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccination was taken because he was going back to school. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EN6199, Expiry: Jun2021) on 10Mar2021 at 13:30 in right arm (at the age of 16-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and experienced loss of taste and smell and joint pain, all events started in Mar2021. Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation. Family Medical History included Sarcoidosis with mother. Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm at 17:30, tiredness at 20:30, shortness of breath, headache at 22:30 and muscle pain at 22:30. On 01Apr2021, the patient experienced fever at 00:30, chills at 01:30, redness at 02:30, leg pain at 08:30, fatigue (ongoing) at 02:30, joint pain at 08:30, too sick to get out of bed and passed out and hit the floor, put a big bump on his head at 05:30 (about 15 hours after second dose, patient was at the kitchen table with his head between his knees trying to breathe, passed out, hit the floor and put a big bump on his head). On 02Apr2021, the patient experienced brain fog at 14:30, swelling at 14:30, swollen glands at 02:30, loss of taste and smell to some extent at 14:30 and too sick to get out of bed. On day 2 (02Apr2021) and was still about pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit and on 21Apr2021 (after 21 days) sometimes over sometimes less. On the following Monday (05Apr2021), he struggled back to school after 5 days, but came home early. He has just been trashed, too trashed to train for his sport, further described as too weak to train, he hadn&#39;t trained for 3 weeks. He still has a fever. His local doctor did not have any suggestions other than he should take acetaminophen and ibuprofen alternately to get rid of the headache and fever. In 2021, the patient experienced 2-inch diameter raised circle at injection site and disappeared after 10 days and there was a time he could not barely remember his name, tried to study but just wasn&#39;t there, head on desk. Still has difficulty focusing and doing his calculus. It was reported that the time to recover from any exertion seems to be longer by a lot. On 01Apr2021, body temperature reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient tried to do a few things like a week ago just because he couldn&#39;t stand to be in the house anymore he took a bike out for about 15 minutes and was just trashed from that experience and took 3 days to recover. The events did not require emergency room visit nor physician&#39;s office neither hospitalized. The outcome was recovered from loss of consciousness, head injury on 01Apr2021; from illness on 02Apr2021; from headache on 04Apr2021; from chills on 06Apr2021; from pain in arm and fatigue on 07Apr2021; from erythema on 11Apr2021; from ageusia and anosmia on 14Apr2021; from lymphadenopathy on 16Apr2021; from arthralgia on 17Apr2021; from myalgia on 18Apr2021; from leg pain on 21Apr2021; from vaccination site swelling in 2021; then recovered with sequel from dyspnoea on 05Apr2021 and from swelling on 07Apr2021; then recovering from pyrexia, feeling abnormal; then not recovered from asthenia and unknown for the remaining events.

We put the patient flat on the ground to protect from a fall injury and his seizing stopped. His color was very ashy and he was not responding properly to questions we asked.  In about 2 minutes, he became more coherent and began talking  and responding to our questions. Paramedics were immediately called and they arrived 30 minutes later after 3 phone calls to follow up.  Father was with patient.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable reporter reporting for her son, via Pfizer sponsored program.  A 16-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose at the age of 16-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.   The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  After 24 hours from vaccination, on 25Apr2021, he felt pain on the injection site. For that, the mother gave her son Tylenol to treat the symptoms. Then after 24 hours, on 26Apr2021 he felt fine. However, 2 days after, on 28Apr2021, he felt pain underneath the left side of his armpit, had a fever with a temperature of 102.8 F, and the right side of his neck was swollen. In addition to this, he was experiencing a lot of body aches, headache, and pain on his neck. They already contacted their HCP and prescribed him with antibiotics in Apr2021. He was tired and almost lethargic in Apr2021. Reporter wanted to know if her son should still receive the 2nd dose. The reporter was invited to consult her HCP. The outcome of pain on the injection site was recovering, of all other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Neck swelling, Armpit pain, and Fever cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Second dose of Pfizer vaccine received Friday afternoon (4/2/2021). Went to bed Friday evening with &#34;normal&#34; side effects of mild fever and sore arm at injection site. Woke up Saturday morning with no sense of smell or taste. Called primary care provider who conducted a video visit and expressed concern that he may have had an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 prior to injection (no symptoms displayed at all in weeks prior). Order a COVID test for Sunday morning. Woke up Sunday morning with sense of taste and smell back. Proceeded with PCR test, which came back as &#34;negative&#34; on Sunday evening. No other symptoms observed, and other side effects noted above (sore arm, fever) resolved by Sunday morning as well. Seems to suggest loss of sense of taste and smell likely due to vaccine since there was a clear temporal relationship which resolved in approximately 24 hours.

Recommendation: Can continue use of OTC anti-histamines (in this case benadryl) if rash continues to itch. Hydrocortisone cream may also be applied to rashes.  These rashes can start a few days to more than a week after the first shot and are sometimes quite large. These rashes are also known as &#34;COVID arm.&#34; If you experience &#34;COVID arm&#34; after getting the first shot, you should still get the second shot at the recommended interval if the vaccine you got needs a second shot. Tell your vaccination provider that you experienced a rash or &#34;COVID arm&#34; after the first shot. Your vaccination provider may recommend that you get the second shot in the opposite arm.

No immediate vaccine reactions. He went home, complained of pain at the vaccination site and took a nap because he stayed up late the night before.  On Thursday morning, he woke up with chills and feeling like having a fever. He took Tylenol and then took a nap. On Thursday night, he began to have chest pain but he did not tell his parents.  On Friday, he continued to have chest pain so he told his parents about it. His father told him that if chest pain got worse, they would go to an ER. On that night (Friday) at 1am, he told his parents that he was not feeling well, his chest pain had gotten worse and he wanted to be taken to an ER. He also had abdominal pain, dizziness, disorientation, and he vomited. He was taken to ER where he was found to have elevated troponin of 10. The ER recommended  transferring for further work up and the father drove him to the hospital. At the hospital, he was found to have elevated troponins and NT-proBNP concerning for myocarditis of unclear etiology. He was monitored on telemetry and had no concerning ectopy. He had an echo on admission that demonstrated no structural abnormalities, trivial mitral valve regurge, and normal biventricular systolic function. EKG was unremarkable. Troponins were trended q6h and decreased from 32 -- &gt; 23 -- &gt; 17. NT-pro-BNP decreased from 439 to 322 at discharge.

                                                1st dose of Pfizer administered. A little over 1 hour elapsed before patient developed hives and itching beginning at injection site (deltoid), spreading first to elbow of the same arm, then to knuckles, chest, neck, torso, and face. Some wheezing was heard by family members, but the patient displayed no other significant signs of respiratory distress. The patient lives where only accessible via boat or plane. Family called a triage line and spoke with a nurse who encouraged immediate Medivac due to location time and extensive transit times to the nearest medical facility; however, family opted to keep child at home. A physician instructed the parents to administer 50 mg of Benadryl every 6 hours, which the family did. Rash and discomfort lasted approximately 4-7 days before total resolution.

                                                The day after the vaccination started hives.  But it was slow so thought could be food allergic reaction. Over a period of 2 weeks it developed never went off.  Noticing the hives   getting worse and the epsode starting day after vaccination suspected it the cause and so went to primary care physician.  She diagnosed the hives related to medical side effects and only medical related item he had within the last 1 year was this vaccine.  She put him on Methylprednisolone for 6 days along with Cetirizine HCL 10mg.  The hives appeared to be suppressed for the first 3 days where the dose was higher, however, when the dosage was getting lower after day 3 it came back with high intensity.  Lips, fingers, tongue...swollen and with fever running at upto 101.6.  Again went to the doctor, she put him on Prednisone with 40 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 3 days, 10mg for 3 days and 10mg alternate days.  It literally took more than 1 and half month still not recovered.  Hives are still on and also severe cold with mucus and cough started since (05/09/21).  Fever show up on and off even now.  We&#39;re referred to allergy specialists.  She asked to not take 2nd dose.  Increased dosage of Antihistamines, asked to continue Prednisone 10mg for 6 more day daily 10mg and if cold and cough does go in the next 2 days may put on antibiotics.

                                                17-year old M with history of recurrent ear infections requiring PE tube placement who was in his usual state of health until 5/5 when he noticed a new itchy hive-like rash. He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.  He was started on milrinone (5/11-5/12) after initial TTE was concerning for severely diminished LV function. Follow-up TTE 12 hours later was normal (on milrinone), and remained so after milrinone was discontinued 5/12. Follow-up TTE after discontinuation remained normal. Cardiac MRI was completed 5/14, although read remains pending. He received IVIG on 5/11, and was started on methylpred 50 mg IV BID, Anakinra 100 mg SQ BID 5/14,  and transitioned to prednisone 30 mg PO BID with clinical improvement, down-trending troponin and systemic inflammatory labs.  Subsequent CBCs have been notable for rising leukocytosis (5/16 WBC 56.3) and thrombocytosis (5/16 plts 690) and 4&#43; spherocytes (with no known personal or prior history of spherocytosis). He will likely be discharged 5/17.   Infectious evaluation was unrevealing including cultures and viral studies. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were sent, but remain pending. Pt. initial COVID-19 infection was diagnosed October 2020, with positive saliva PCR testing.  He was symptomatic for 3-5 days.  He received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine 4/27 in his left arm; denies any significant reactions (arm swelling, injection site redness, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, fatigue, or fever). He has had passing contact with school classmates who have recently been diagnosed with COVID19.

The hives are on my torso, back, armpits, underside of arms, pelvic-area, scalp. neck, and chin. They&#39;re itchy and were much more inflamed when they first appeared.  I have not taken any medications so far to treat this. Presently, the inflammation has gone down and the appearance of the hives have also slowed down. They still continue to be itchy, and have left dried up marks all over my body.

At further inspection I noticed that he was having a rash . I had a sit for a few more minutes then his mom came up and we noticed that his arm started to swell. We gave him 2 capsules Benadryl 25mg and instructed him to go to urgent care. Called for a follow up later in the evening and found that urgent care send him to the ER. The rash was spread all over and well as the swelling. He swelled all the way to his toes. He also tuned white and became very lightheaded at the ER. They gave him IV Benadryl and dexamethasone and was sent home. It has been recommended by the ER doctors to not get the 2nd dose.

I noticed it about three days after I received the vaccine, and then went to the doctor&#39;s office the next day to have it looked at. They addressed it as dermatitis, and I recieved doxycycline and predniSONE to take/use for the following 12 days, which I have been using since the morning of the 6th.

                                                My son received his first vaccine dose in his left arm on Friday April 9 at 8:45 am.  By Sunday when he woke up, he noticed a walnut sized lump on his left clavicle.  It felt unusual and moved on the bone every time he turned his head or moved his arm. There was no redness or fever and it felt hard.  It was still there on Monday morning (April 12) so we called his primary care doctor which is where he received the vaccine.  The doctor felt it could be a cyst or swollen lymph node and is sending him to a general surgeon next week for further evaluation. The doctor was uncertain if the lump was directly related to the vaccination. Other than acne, patient has no other preexisting conditions.  He did have COVID19 in November with only mild symptoms (positive test on 11-23-20; no fever or cough, just felt tired for a couple days).

                                                Patient called to say she was having a reaction to the COVID vaccine that she received Thursday.  She reported that her arm where she received the injection was red, swollen, and itching very bad.  It started the same day as the injection. She already takes 3 Benadryl a day and says she cannot apply ice to the area because &#34;ice makes her hurt.&#34;  I advised her to increase the amount of Benadryl she was taking and that she could use a topical steroid to the area.  I also advised that it should go away on its own but to follow up with her doctor if she has any further issues.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

Not feeling any other side effects internet sources said that this was rare enough to report. I did some weight lifting the day before I noticed this.

                                                ED Visit 3/11/21 History of Present Illness 21 year old man pmhx of autism, recurrent abscesses, presents with complaint of L axilla swelling and drainage. Pt received COVID vaccine in L arm on 3/1. Pt did well until 3/5 when he started to complain of pain in the L armpit. Mother examined the area and did not see anything concerning. The pain continued through the weekend, no fevers. Pt felt warm on Monday, no temperature taken. Mother then noted a few &#34;bump&#34; near the L armpit. The bumps continued to swell and be painful on Tuesday, went to pediatrician and was prescribed Keflex. Pt has been taking Keflex but continues to spike fevers, Tmax 102F on Wednesday. Pt had fevers yesterday and today of &#34;about 100.&#34; Pt took a nap today, and woke up with the area draining. Mother states that the drainage was smelly pus. Called PCP who recommended evaluation. ED course: Patient observed in the emergency department of antipyretics and did not have any further fever.  I will switch his treatment to clindamycin and provide topical bacitracin and provide strict criteria to come back if pt became febrile instructions provided to mom.   Patient safe for discharge to home. Discharged in improved condition. Written instructions reviewed with family.  3/18/2021 Discharge Summary History of Present Illness 21yo man with h/o autism and multiple soft tissue infections including cellulitis and pilonidal cyst who presented to the ED 3/13/2021 after axillary drainage and fever.  He had been treated outpatient with keflex, but continued to have fevers at home. Re-evaluated at ED and placed on clindamycin. Cultures from outpatient showing skin flora. Mother has been doing several dressings of drainage at home and ongoing fevers up to 102 so was brought to the ED for evaluation. No cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, recent travel, known sick contacts.  Summary of hospitalization: He re-presented to ED on 3/13/2021 and was started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. A CT scan with contrast done to determine extension of abscess, which was fortunately limited to the subcutaneous plane (no infiltration near bone or into muscle fascia). In the ED, patient&#39;s creatinine was 1.5. Patient received IVF and his creatinine downtrended to 0.75 on 3/18/21.   The surgical course was uneventful. Successful debridement of the left axillary abscess was performed on 03/4/21. Wound cultures grew Actinomyces Europaeus and S. Epidermidis and Infectious Disease was consulted. Their antibiotic recommendations to discontinue the cefepime/flagyl and start vanc/CTX were followed. Sensitivity analyses showed S. Epidermidis was sensitive to linezolid, tetracyclin, tigecyclin, bactruim and vancomycin. The Actinomyces Europaeus sensitivities have not yet resulted at time of discharge. Per ID recommendations, the vanc and CTX were discontinued and oral doxycycline was started, which should be continued for 6 months. It could be considered to switch to PO amoxicillin after 2 weeks and finish the 6 month course with amoxicillin. This will be discussed during outpatient follow-up. Per ID recommendations, the following labs should be checked 2 weeks after discharge (on 3/29/21) and could be spaced out to every 4 weeks thereafter if normal: CBC with differential, CRP, ESR, BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT.  The patient is scheduled to see (ID) on 5/5/21. Dermatology was consulted per ID recs for evaluation of spots on the chest and back. Per dermatology these spots are keloid, not suspicious for hidradenitis suppurative, there is no need for biopsy. For pilonidal cyst spot dermatology recommends rec hibicleans cream. Immunology was consulted for recurring abscesses and recommended the following tests, which were ordered, in addition to outpatient followup: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, specific Ab titers: for strep pneumo IgG (23 serotypes) and tetanus IgG, lymphocyte subsets, T cell memory panel, B cell memory panel, neutrophil DHR, CH50.  A wound VAC was placed on the left axillary wound bed on 03/15/21 and exchanged on 3/17/21.  Patient tolerated the wound vac changes well with 5mg of oxycodone taken 1 hour prior to the vac change. On 03/18/21 patient was discharged with a home wound vac and VNA.  At the time of discharged patient was afebrile, his pain was well controlled, his oxygen saturations were &gt;94% on room air, he was tolerating a regular diet and voiding/stooling without issues.

Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

This was accompanied by a mass that developed under my right armpit, about 4-5 cm in diameter and bulging out to the point that I felt it touching my upper arm before I even saw it in a mirror. It was not red, and it was malleable with a small, hard nodule in the center. I used an ice compression and some ibuprofen over a few days, and it has receded about 95% of the way, almost back to normal.

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EK9231, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (top of shoulder) on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history, stated that he is perfeclty healthy.  There were no concomitant medications. There were no prior vaccination within 4 weeks.The patient received the first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine on 12Jan2021. It was administered in his left arm; however, he has developed a rash on his right arm and right leg. It&#39;s kind of large but it is not oozing or anything. The patient wanted to know if this is a normal side effect. He wanted to know if this a serious allergic reaction. He stated that he got the first dose Tuesday and he is beginning to have, he does not know if it is a mild allergic reaction or just a symptom but he has a rash on his right arm right around the elbow and one his leg it is like little red bumps that kind of itch. In his paperwork it is saying one symptoms that could be severe allergic reaction is a rash all over the body so he is wondering if this is a mild reaction of some sort and also if there are any other cases like this. He first noticed the rash on his arm yesterday (14Jan2021) after he took a shower he looked on his arm and seen a trail going down and today he noticed one on his leg. He noticed the area on his arm yesterday and today he noticed the area on his leg. He says they are little red bumps that itch. He does not know if it was kind of wet but there was a little trail going down and its itchy, it is only the 2 spots that he has noticed are really bad. He says is has persisted he thinks it has remained about the same, he definitely won&#39;t say they have gotten worse, they may have swelled up a little bit, he is trying not to scratch but he has scratched a little bit so that is probably why it has swollen up a little bit. The patient has not taken anything for the events; other than using lotion, he was putting lotion on when he first noticed it. The patient had not recovered from the events.

Severity is moderate. Quality dull pain. Currently involves entire left arm (arm, elbow forearm wrist hand).. Did have some swelling and motor loss, NO CP, SOB or sensory loss, no redness, no injury, no fever, chills, ha, depression sore throat, cough, rash, lymphadenopathy, abd pain, GI distress, no trauma or recent illnesses. 2/21: admitted clinic w/rhabdomyolysis: no preceding workouts, increased activity on ship, back sleeper, no alcohol, no trauma,. nsp: skin intact, no erythema. Mild edema to upper arm around triceps. Mild purple discoloration to dorsum of hand. Palp: TTP about triceps. TTP anterior shoulder. TTP biceps. Able to palpate triceps tendon and biceps tendon. NTTP throughout the rest of hand and forearm. Hand is cooler relative to contralateral side. NTTP cervical spine. ROM: Full passive ROM of the shoulder and elbow with pain. No micromotion pain with any joint in the upper extremity. Painless cervical spine ROM. Motor: 3/5 strength to OP/FPL/2nd FDP, EIP/EPL, 1st and 2nd DIO. 3/5 deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors. Sens: Decreased sensation throughout entirety of forearm and hand distal to the elbow. Above the elbow, sensation is intact. Vasc: 2&#43; radial pulse, symmetric to contralateral side. BCR &lt;3 sec. Hand is cooler than contralateral side. Lab: CRP &lt;5, ESR 4, CK 31,924, PT 14, INR 1.1, D-dimer 0.46, AST 610, ALT 186, Cr 0.94, WBC 6.3 Imaging: Radiographs of the chest, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand demonstrate no fracture. The shoulder is well located. CTA starting at the heart demonstrate no vascular abnormalities. Assessment: unlikely that he has compartment syndrome or a cervical spine pathology. His exam does not localize to one specific innervation or muscle group. His paresthesias and diffuse 3/5 weakness on exam may be related to parsonage turner syndrome (post viral neuritis) versus edema. While he does have a cool hand and mild/moderate edema on exam, his CTA is normal and his exam is very reassuring that this is not compartment syndrome. He likely has rhabdomyolysis based on upper arm swelling in the setting of CK of 31924.   Discharge 2/22/2021: He received a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and was encouraged to drink large amounts of water. Repeat CK levels showed to be down trending as were his AST and ALT enzymes. Plain radiographs of his left arm and shoulder were unremarkable as was CT angiography of his chest. Electrolytes and renal lab work was within normal limits throughout the hospitalization.On the day of discharge, he was tolerating a PO diet, ambulating without difficulty, and hemodynamically stable. LUE w/ minimal swelling, no erythema. TTP over L triceps belly, No TTP over the distal LUE. Somewhat decreased sensation to light touch over distal LUE. 2&#43; radial pulses b/l. LUE ROM somewhat limited 2/2 pain, but intact. ---- to f/u with HCP in 2 weeks, sooner if worse (medical officer)   CK 2/22/21 was down to 14653

On day 4 I experience uncontrollable facial spasms originating from a swollen lymph node.

Went to the pharmacy today April 4th to get an itch cream and the pharmacist told me I was the third or fourth person reporting rash after the vaccination and oriented me to report to CDC. She told me to use hydrocortizone and avoid sun exposure. I used it but still feel itchy.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

Went to urgent care evening of 2nd day, received 50mg diphenhydramine that suppressed itching enough to sleep. Woke up itching and red at 6am of 3rd day, took 25mg diphenhydramine. Took 40mg prednisone at 8am. Went to urgent care at 10am for worsening hives, spreading and covering torso and onto face. Received dexamethasone injection into glute and prednisone prescription was upped to 50mg daily for the next week.  Took OTC Zyrtec and Pepcid once following the second urgent care visit. Hives responded well after 2hrs post visit, assuming due to prednisone and dexamethasone. Day 4 (1/12/20) woke up with widespread hives that became further inflamed until an hour after prednisone taken with breakfast. Also woke up with slight sore throat and wheezing, both of which subsided. Currently scheduled to see an allergist on 1/13/20. No known allergies and no other known introduction of allergens in the past week.

When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

                                                got up about 5:15AM to use the restroom, parents heard a huge crash and we came running - he had collapsed and fainted in the bathroom, against the toilet, (with shelves and glass crashing down him - he grabbed the shelves and had a few cuts and bruises), was unresponsive, no color in his face, could not stand or move, could barely speak - slumped against the toilet.  Parents called 911 and tried to get him to respond, he was listless but opened his eyes - we lifted him and moved him to recliner in living room.  Fire Dept./EMT&#39;s arrived within a few minutes, blood pressure was 87/43, glucose was normal.  EMT&#39;s determined it was a reaction to the vaccine and asked if he wanted an ambulance or if parents should drive him for further care - he opted for us to drive him (his Mom called the Dr. on staff first - Dr. said it was a reaction to the vaccine and he should not get a 2nd dose).  Patient&#39;s Dad took him to Urgent Care - they ran an EKG (normal), and stayed there until his blood pressure showed (although still low)  normal/acceptable again.  I looked at the CDC website for covid anaphylaxis and it appears it was an allergic reaction (cardiovascular), on the site, he had these symptoms:  &#34;Cardiovascular: fainting; hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure); pallor.  ... Symptoms of anaphylaxis often occur within 15-30 minutes of vaccination, though it can sometimes take several hours for symptoms to appear.&#34;

Benedryl helped a little bit but the rash didn?t fully go away until I went to Urgent Care and got a corticosteroid prescription. The rash wasn?t overly itchy. I have never had an allergy to any other medication, food, vaccine etc. in my life. I went to urgent care on Friday 1/22 and the rash was gone by the time I finished the dosages on 1/27. I had no other symptoms of any other kind and nothing onto my neck or face.

At the time of patients fainting I was mixing up covid-19 vaccinations when the technicians said we need you to come out here because a patient is having a seizure, When arriving on the scene I found patient unconsious on the floor face down, while assessing the scene I noticed some blood on floor. I tried to look for any trauma, patient was breathing and I tried to awaken him. I told someone to call 911 and contact a store manager. Then all of a sudden he popped up and sat up like nothing happened. I then noticed the brusing on his nose and asked for an ice pack and a bottle of water. Patient knew his name, was coherent, and seemed to be fine. I stayed with patient until paramedics arrived. Paramedics did a thorough examination and everything checked out. Patient waited for parents to arrive instead of going with paramedics. Vaccinator stayed with patient till his parents arrived.

Symptoms included headache, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, feeling feverish, and itching on torso, arms, and legs . Symptoms seemed to improve over the next week or two before worsening again on 3/27/21 around 10:00 am. On the day of 3/27 /21 I experienced headaches, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, muscle aches, diarrhea, and vision problems. Currently on 3/30/21 symptoms have improved but I am still experiencing dull headaches and brain fog, as well as itching on torso, arms and legs and some vision problems.   I have not seen a provider  for these issues but have an appointment scheduled for 3/31/21. Treatment includes ibuprofen as needed.

                                                The patient reported that they were experiencing tightness in their arm and believed it swelled initially. They left the pharmacy area and went to get Tylenol that was recommended by the pharmacist. They then began to get lightheaded and had syncope, attempted to get back up and the cashier asked to if they wanted to sit, but fell again. It was not clear initially to the employee who was helping them they had received the vaccine. 911 was called and the employee helping them let the pharmacist know they had just gotten their vaccine. The immunizing pharmacist went to check on the patient. EMTs were already helping the patient and had taken his blood pressure which was normal the lightheadedness had stopped and both sitting and standing blood pressure was the same. He had an elevated heart rate per the patient but didn&#39;t know any of the numbers the EMTs had taken. His father was driving him. He was not experiencing any symptoms and the injection site had no swelling and was otherwise unremarkable.
