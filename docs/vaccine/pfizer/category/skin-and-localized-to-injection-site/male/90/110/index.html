Son went home after that.  He tried to contact him on 3/1/2021 but wasn&#39;t able to reach him.  On 3/2/21 the brother tried to contact him and wasn&#39;t able to reach him.  They contacted the police dept on 3/2/2021 around 8:00 AM to do a well check.  Pt was found on the couch like he had fallen asleep but was deceased.  They suspect he probably expired on 3/1/2021.  No autopsy will be conducted per the son.

The entire next week the rash continued to increase and appear on the body trunk as well as legs and arms.  We used hydrocodone 10 applied to the rash and used Benadryl 25 mg  orally.  We saw our Primary Care physician, who diagnosed the allergy to the vaccine.  He advised not taking the second dose.  After 10 days, the itchiness is subsiding as well as redness and bumps.

He received the second dose of the same vaccine around January 22, 2021. Pockmarks and bleeding scratch marks were noted by a family member on the patient&#39;s face prior to this second dose. On January 28, 2021 a family member was alerted that the patient was suffering from severe bullous pemphigoid- a skin condition that has never been experienced by the patient, has been reported to be related to COVID-19 viral infection, and to T-cell responses promoted by vaccines. A corticosteroid was given, but did not work. Blisters developed to the point hands had to be dressed.

A 91-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number EL3246 and Expiration Date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart burn. The concomitant medications were reported as omeprazole (PRILOSEC) for heart burn. Patient took the Pfizer vaccine on 13Jan2021 and 1 and a half days later (evening of 14Jan2021) he broke out with a terrible rash all over his body on his chest, groin and back with terrible itching. He reports that he went to Urgent care/clinic and was prescribed prednisone for 6 days and reports that there is still a little bit there but the rash appears much better and stopped itching. The rash, it practically eliminated the rash there are still some signs of it but at the height of it, it was very vibrant and red. Also the second day he started taking another pill, Prilosec 20 mg for heart burn and he doesn&#39;t know if the rash was caused by the vaccine or the Prilosec but his question is, is that going to deter him from taking the second dose on 03Feb2021. Patient thinks he started the Prilosec either on the 14Jan2021 or 15Jan2021 and he stopped, after 2 tablets he stopped taking it because he wasn&#39;t sure, he didn&#39;t want to aggravate anything if it was caused by the Prilosec.  Now asking for guidance of if he should receive the second dose. Treatment for events was prednisone. The outcome of itching was recovered in Jan2021. The outcome of rash was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.
