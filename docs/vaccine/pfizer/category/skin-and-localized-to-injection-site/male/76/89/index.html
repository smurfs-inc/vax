Lasted about 45 minutes.  took Advil and used the CPAC to calm my breathing down.  Then slept until 9:00 am.  But after I woke, I felt tired the rest of the day.  I am doing fine now.  I am not sure if this was a side effect of the covid vaccine or not. But I thought I let you know.

                                                I write today because On January 20, I received my first Pfizer covid vaccination. I have felt no side effects but when I read the story of the doctor who died of bleeding after that vaccination, I became concerned because I do get minor petechiae from the blood thinner and then yesterday (1/25) I noticed a petechiae different from the rest. It was on my back and was bigger than the few tiny pinpoint ones from the medication.  I am wondering if the vaccine made the difference and if my platelet count is going down. Is it possible that the vaccine might interact with blood thinners and create Thrombocytopenia? I have never heard of that disease before, but I think it can exist unknown or maybe be started by the vaccine. I will be watching for any additional petechiae, but would it be good to get a platelet test to see if something has gone wrong? The doctor with zero platelets, no symptoms and death by bleeding has caused me concern and if blood thinners, my eczema or undiagnosed Thrombocytopenia cause issues for vaccines, that information would be good to know. I am a 76 year old male in generally good health. My fitbit walking target is at least 4 miles/day and I usually reach that. At 5? 9? and 172 pounds I enjoy golf weekly when winter is over. Two issues do exist. Twenty seven months ago while searching for the cause of some PVCs the doctors put in a stent and scarred a diagonal artery causing what they said was a heart attack. Recovery was quick and subsequent tests indicate the heart was healed and working fine. I have no heart symptoms, but since then have been on first Brillinta and now Clopidorgrel (Plavix) plus baby aspirin. Second, last August I was diagnosed with eczema which might be psoriasis which I think is autoimmune related.  It is annoying at times but the prescription cream helps.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 76-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration at the left deltoid on 26Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 26Jan2021. When he came home that day his left arm swelled up and had a knot at the injection site. States he went right out, clarifies he went to sleep for hours. The next day (27Jan2021) when he woke up, he rubbed the area and it was sore. Three days ago (30Jan2021), he started running out of breath, he would walk to the mailbox and have to stop since he was out of breath. He never had that happen before. He was not sure what it was or if something else going on. He would have no breath whatsoever if he gets up to walk. When he was sitting still he was ok. If he gets up to walk to the bathroom, he was out of breath by the time he gets to the bathroom. States he was not short of breath as long as he was not doing anything. States it was crazy though when he starts walking and he gets out of breath. This has never happened to him before. He does not know if it was the vaccine or something else. He saw the shortness of breath was one of the side effects. He wants to find out what he should do and if he should go to the hospital. Advised to contact hcp. He asks if he was supposed to go back for the second shot. He has an appointment with his doctor in the next two weeks for all the medications he takes. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 76-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number EL9263, expiry date not reported), intramuscular on 26Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included years ago he did have an issue with a lung disease when he went to (country name); he did have COVID 19 in Mar2020 and he recovered from that; high blood pressure; psoriatic arthritis diagnosed 30 years ago; and non-smoker. Family medical history included that they are all smokers in his family, and he is not. His sister died of pancreatic cancer and his mother died of oat cell lung cancer. Concomitant medications included valsartan (DIOVAN 160 mg) for high blood pressure at 160 mg, daily started 3.5 years ago to an unknown date; and patient was taking some health store vitamins. The patient previously took infliximab (REMICADE) on unspecified dates 5 years ago as Arthritis medication administered IV and apparently it lowered his immune system and he wound up in the hospital with a lung infection. He recovered completely. He does not have a lot or expiration. It was administered in the doctor&#39;s office and he does not go to that doctor anymore. It was reported that patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  He had second dose of Shingles vaccine and it was close to 4 weeks ago. Shingrix administered on upper left arm received it at an in-store clinic, and patient had slight injection site discomfort. No other vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient received the first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine on 26Jan2021 at noon, with just a bit of discomfort. He seemed to be fine except slight injection site discomfort, also reported as injection site discomfort on left upper arm, on 26Jan2021. Later that night (also reported as last night 26Jan2021 23:00) he felt achy, he had bad body aches and pain and still has it this morning. Injection site pain worsened last night and now it has improved. He woke up in the middle of the night, and had a fever 99.7 F, 99.9 fever and later it went as high as 101 F (26Jan2021). He took Advil and Tylenol. The body aches improved after he took 2 Tylenol when he took his temperature. He took temperature about 1.5 hour ago. He went into bed and waited and took it again about 1/2 hour ago and it went up to 101. He then took Tylenol and took his temperature again. This morning (27Jan2021) his temperature was now back/down to 99.3 F. He was still feeling aches but not as bad as before. He might still have a slight temperature now, but it has improved. He believed vaccination was given in the muscle because it was in the upper part of his arm where the skin is thinner. He had a slight headache and was quite tired (27Jan2021). Patient asked if there&#39;s anything he should do or be concerned about. He was scheduled for the second dose on 16Feb2021 and he heard that the second dose was stronger than the first one, that after the second dose there may be more side effect, and he wanted to know if this is true and wanted to know if he can get the second dose. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events discomfort/slight injection site discomfort, he felt achy/body aches and pains, fever, and injection site pain. Patient had no ER or physician&#39;s office required. The events discomfort/slight injection site discomfort, he felt achy/body aches and pains, fever, and injection site pain were recovering. The outcome of the event tired and headache was unknown.

Medical history included stents for my heart. Concomitant medication included metoprolol, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), furosemide and clopidogrel. The patient previously took gefalexin and levaquin and experienced drug hypersensitivity. On 29Jan2021 08:00, sore developed under the bandaid placed on injection site and the patient reported as, he received first dose on 28Jan2021, right afterwards the next morning I removed the band aid they had placed and there was a big red dot and it was itchy. Also both my arms are stiff and i have some pain. I got the injection on the Left arm but the Right arm feels the same. I spoke with my doctor he told me to put bacitracin on it for few days but it&#39;s still there. It&#39;s less itchy but the red dot is still there its 2-3 inches from the injection site and also said, I think I&#39;m going to skip the second dose. A red sore developed under the band aid that was applied to cover the injection site. It is under the right edge of the band aid. The area where the exact needle penetrated is healed. Both arms are sore at the top by where they meet the shoulder. Outcome of the events were not recovered.

At the time, I only had soreness of the left arm at the injection site and virtually no other symptoms except a mild headache for a few hours.  However, during the month or so between the vaccines and post-vaccine period, I developed pain in both shoulders with moderate-severe rotator cuff symptoms. This was pain in reaching in almost any direction. Also, I began to notice heaviness in both upper legs, front and back, which in a week or so progressed to tiredness and then to achiness, and finally to pain when I would squat, bend over, or get up from a chair. I have  never had either symptom before.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL9262, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Jan2021 15:30 at a single dose for protection from the virus at the Physician Office. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2011 and ongoing. The patient also thought he had a Covid respiratory infection in Feb2020. He had a prolonged moderate to severe respiratory infection. He thought at first that he had the flu, but he had a flu shot. He thinks he had Covid. He had antibody studies in May2020 (last spring) that were negative. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient previously had influenza vaccine (flu shot). The patient reported hypothermia after getting the first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. On the same day of vaccination (26Jan2021), he had injection site tenderness. The next day, (27Jan2021), his arm was suddenly painful; he began to have chills 29 hours after receiving the vaccine (27Jan2021) and was shaking. He also had a temperature of 93.7 orally, confirmed with two different digital thermometers. He took his temperature with a new electronic thermometer that he purchased at a pharmacy. His temperature was 92.7 on 27Jan2021. He repeated it with another electronic thermometer. The first evening (27Jan2021), his temperature went to 96.5 to 98 degrees. Then it went down to 93.2 degrees. He covered up with blankets and his temperature increased and the chills stopped. He stated that this was hypothermia. He had low temperatures the following day (28Jan2021) as well, his temperature was 93-94 degrees. His temperature was 93.7 degrees. Other times he checked his temperature and it was 96.5 degrees. When his temperature was low the first time, it only lasted for about three hours. The second time it happened he went to bed and covered up. It lasted for an hour or two. He noticed it again two days ago. The patient also stated the arm he received the injection in was tender however progressed to mild to moderately painful when he experienced the chills and low temperatures. The arm tenderness after getting the vaccine was very mild. He noticed it when he rolled over on his arm. He took some Tylenol for it. His son is an internist. He said the hypothermia was medically significant. His son also said hypothermia is equivalent to a fever in the elderly. The patient wanted to know if there have been any reports of hypothermia after the administration of the vaccine. He has concerns about this occurring after the second dose. He is scheduled to receive the second dose on 15Feb2021 or 16Feb2021. The outcome of the event hypothermia was recovered on 30Jan2021 and pain in arm recovered on 27Jan2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown. The events hypothermia, arm pain and injections site tenderness were assessed as related to BNT16B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported hypothermia and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

The patient self-medicated with prednisone and did not seek medical care. Symptoms resolved later the same day they appeared. The patient indicated he had an appointment unrelated to this event scheduled with his primary care physician on March 3, 2021, and was advised to discuss the reaction with the physician at this appointment.

                                                Following Dose 1,  Right Arm became sore at injection site for 4 days, at which time Right armpit became very tender touch and was swollen about size of silver dollar, approx. 1/2 inch thick.  Soreness at injection site subsided over the next 17 days, but tenderness in armpit only diminished slightly.  Following Dose 2, Right Arm was once again sore at injection site for about 4 days, but tenderness to the right armpit became more pronounced, with swelling increasing to the size of a hockey puck.  Size of swelling was easily visible to the eye.  Armpit became more tender to the touch, and has diminished only slightly in size,, as of this reporting.  Mass remains soft to the feel, but easily defined in size and location.  I have taken OTC pain killers to help with the discomfort.  Will continue to monitor its progress, unless notified otherwise.  Do not anticipate seeing my physician at this point.  Have consulted the Web, and have noted that this is a lesser side effect of this vaccine, if swelling remains localized to the injection site.  Thought I should report this side effect only because of the size of the swelling that occured.

                                                1st vaccination Friday. I was fine on Friday. Saturday woke with sore throat, neck, mucus, sore muscles and weak. By mid-afternoon had to go to bed and slept for hours. Got up at 9PM and went back to bed at 11PM. Sunday was better, but this AM (Monday) awakened with itchy skin, pins and needles on hands and feet (gone now) and total exhaustion. Had difficulty breathing (better now), can barely lift arms and had to miss work and went back to bed. I am reporting this because I am scheduled for a 2nd shot on the 26th and not certain it&#39;s a good idea.

The patient asked if that knowledge was a possible remedy. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Next day when I woke up felt a slight headache , abnormal vision issues that included sparkles, blurred vision and a general tiredness. Did not feel refreshed as I normally do when I wake up in the morning. As the day went on sparkles and vision issues remained and headache got worse. Went to bed earlier than normal and next day when woke up the symptoms got worse, I felt like I had a migraine. Vision issues persisted. Laid down around 11AM and took a nap and when I woke up I noticed a blotch in my left eye reminiscent of the shape of a fish (looked like a shark) and it had different colors. Bright yellow and black almost kind of an iridescent green and orange. The shape was still just the colors were different.  I panicked and called the optometrist and explained what happened. They wanted to see me right away. I was able to be seen in the afternoon. They looked at it, did two tests and came with the diagnosis of a branch retinal artery occlusion.  I visited my neuro- ophthalmologist on 01/28 and he confirmed the diagnosis had previously given.  He then ordered fedrate and a couple of other tests. They also did a visual acuity in the left eye (20/30) and color vision (8/8 normal) and color plates and intraocular pressure (16 OS)

Went to urgent care the following Monday afternoon.  Consultation verified the symptoms.  Doctor concluded that the timing indicated a reaction to the vaccination rather than a reaction to the penicillin that I had been taking several days for a UTI.  I have never had any problems with any of the medications or supplements that I take regularly.  The doctor prescribed Prednisone, Cetirizine, and Tagamet, which I am currently taking.  There has not yet been any reduction in my extensive symptoms.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 19Feb2021 08:40 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications including blood thinner and Afib medications. The patient takes 6 medications: some of those medications for 40 years, some for a bit less. There were a couple more added for his heart because 10 years ago he had a case of Afib and the doctor who has now retired took him from 3 meds to 6; and has had no issues for the last 10 years. The patient had his first dose on 19Feb2021 at a clinic and was due/scheduled for his second on 12Mar2021. The patient had severe reactions to the first one so he wanted to know if he should accelerate second shot or stay within three weeks. His reaction was for the first two weeks, he had severe nausea, etcetera, which was getting better that week. He gives 20-minute presentations each morning and the participants in the presentation were nice about it but they say that the patient has fog and thought he should see if he should go in sooner as they were worried about him. His only symptoms remaining after two weeks of severe reactions was that he was very sleepy. All that was left was being tired and mentally in a bit of fog (also reported as mental fog). The patient only had pain to the injection site for a day and was not an issue, then it didn&#39;t take long for him to start getting extremely tired and have nausea. He says all he knows was that from the sheet listing severe reactions, he had every one during the first couple weeks (unspecified), though he never had a fever. He says this week he felt better and he was starting to eat, this was not normal for him to be tired all the time, but at least he was not sick. He says he didn&#39;t treat the pain or nausea, because he was healthy as a horse, and has no problems with a vaccine, shots don&#39;t bother him other than having soreness the first day. The patient was just foggy and tired. The patient was recovering from nausea. The patient recovered from injection site pain on 20Feb2021. The patient has not recovered from mental fog/bit of fog and tired. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Right arm was barely sore where injection administered; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 78-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 17:05 at single dose in the right arm for vaccination. Medical history included eye vitamin/To maintain good eye health, eye disorder, Heart supplement, heart disorder and he had his last annual physical with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in Oct2020. He had his flu shot in Sep2020. Concomitant medication included ramipril taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s; atorvastatin taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s. He believes this is the generic product for Pfizer Lipitor; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN CHILDREN) taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s; ascorbic acid, tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc (AREDS) (also reported as &#34;Advanced Retinol Eye Study Disease&#34;) for eye vitamin/To maintain good eye health; bioflavonoids nos, lecithin, quercetin, ubidecarenone (CO-Q-10 PLUS) taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s for Heart supplement; and unspecified multivitamin taken daily and probably taken all his life, all ongoing. This patient reported he was administered his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 11Jan2021. There were no side effects; his right arm was barely sore where injection administered on 11Jan2021. Onset probably about 19:05-20:05 and he had recovered completely by the next morning when he woke. He had no discomfort during the night, no pain or throbbing, he felt very normal the next morning. He clarified that he has no medical conditions, no flu or illnesses of any other kind. He had his last annual physical with PCP in Oct2020; he has a twice yearly check-up with the Cardiologist that will be coming up soon. Stated that today is the 21st day and he is scheduled to get his second dose at 3:00pm. He asked how the incremental immunity builds up percentage wise after getting the first and second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He asked if there is any restriction or limitation on taking products like Tylenol, Advil or Aspirin before getting the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine; and if those products are ok to use to potentially treat side effects from the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine such as if patient has sore arm or something; and how soon after the second dose side effects can kick in-he believes the briefing documents he was given for the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine said 2-14 days. He asked this particularly because he has an hour drive home after this second dose and wanted to know what to anticipate before attempting to drive home. His wife thought someone told her not to take any Tylenol, Advil or Aspirin before getting the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine which they had not heard of elsewhere, and saw no mention of that in the briefing documents given for the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The with outcome of the event was recovered on 12Jan2021.

                                                There was a significant drug interaction with Efudex Cream that I was applying topically to a pre-cancerous 2-cm-diameter lesion on my left shin. On the day of my first Pfizer shot, the Efudex treated lesion was progressing normally from the desquamation (scabbing and shedding of epithelial scales) to the erosion stage (starting to form a shallow 2.5-cm-diameter ulcer). Starting about Saturday 30 January (three days after the first Pfizer shot) and slowly increasing for the next four days, the Efudex-treated ulcer became deeper, the peripheral 12-cm-diameter skin became redder, and the left foot and ankle became increasingly swollen.  My RN-wife and I (a former medical-research physicist) began research andChronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral. Chronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral.DVERSE EFFECTS, TREATMENT, AND OUTCOME:  discovered that Efudex should not be given concurrently with any of a long list of immunizations.  This is an Efudex problem that should gain another immunization onto that list. Being within a week of finishing the Efudex regimen, we monitored the Efudex-treatment area and the peripheral area carefully. On Thursday 4 Feb (eight days after the first Pfizer shot), the ulcer began unusual drainage, the 12-cm-diameter peripheral area became inflamed, and swelling of the left ankle and foot increased to almost skin-tight - I can upload photos if you need.  Time for immediate action.  My excellent Dermatologist stopped Efudex and started me on Bactrim by mouth for 10 days, and Gentamicin topical antibiotic on the ulcerated central area and Triamcinolone topical corticosteroid on the peripheral and swollen areas for three weeks.  Good choices.  Improvement was immediate and continued improving for the next three weeks.  By the time of the second Pfizer shot on 24 February, the central area was healing well, in the late-reepithelialization stage (regrowth of epithelial tissue that now formed a completely-covering scar tissue with no oozing), and with all inflammation and swelling completely gone.  After the second Pfizer shot (taken 20 days after stopping Efudex), there were zero adverse effects of any kind. NOTE: There were absolutely zero other adverse effects of any kind throughout the entire series: no chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in pulse or blood pressure (120/70 range), loss of taste or smell, sore throat, cough, lung congestion, fatigue, feeling of being unwell, shortness of breath, injection-site swelling or redness, hives, swelling of face, decreased kidney function, or other adverse cardiovascular, neurological or pulmonary effects. There was no additional joint pain above my normal osteoarthritis.  After both shots, I felt a slight normal-range injection-site soreness for the next few hours, but no site swelling, rash, redness, or other problem.  We recommend that this immunization be added to the Efudex  proscribed or warned&#39; list.

Saw derm again on 18Mar2021, received cortisone injection with second one on 25Mar2021- first shot-4 hours of relief from itching, rash lessened temporarily and then new areas started developing. BX results (as reported): some of the features raise possibility of angiolyphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia but favors dermal hypersensitivity reaction. No swollen lymph nodes that patient notes. Patient is extremely itchy. Taking benadryl and taking allegra during the day. Only change recently has been switching norco from 7.5/325 three times a day to 5/325 four times a day.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). I couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately. put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination. He died at 5:30 a.m. on April 1, 2021.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 02Jan2021 00:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hard of hearing, surgery to remove the cancer, cancer broke his arm and he had a reverse shoulder replacement (medical conditions predating treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination); kidney failure that is better, muscle (disorder), blood pressure (abnormal), anxiety and radiation. The patient was previously given oxycodone, Ativan, and Xanax to take as needed after his surgery, but he has not taken them since Oct2020. Concomitant medication included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) for anxiety, amlodipine for blood pressure, metoprolol for blood pressure, tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX) from Sep2020 for kidney, carisoprodol (SOMA) from 22Oct2020 for muscle relaxant, ferrous sulfate, docusate sodium (STOOL SOFTENER), aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID]) all were ongoing and other unspecified products. The reporter stated that she and her husband got the vaccine on 02Jan2021 and the husband has developed a rash under his arm from his arm pit to elbow underneath, on his sides, below his belly button and in the groin area and on the buttocks. Rash was itching on 06Jan2021. She wanted to know could the COVID 19 vaccine cause this 4 days later. The patient noticed the itchy rash four days later on Wednesday afternoon 06Jan2021. He took Benadryl 25mg tablet by mouth that night before bed and then in the morning and put over the counter itch relief cream on it so in the night around 0200AM not too long after taking the Benadryl, the rash went away, pretty much gone. Today it seems to have come back and now it was worse because he has it on his buttocks. He didn&#39;t have it there at first. Mentioned that the patient also took a cool shower before going to bed. Wife mentioned that she just looked the rash right now and it was improved. Asking should he continue taking his relief or stop and let the doctor look at it? Advised caller to consult HCP. He is planning to get the next vaccine 23Jan2021. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The events did not require a visit to physician office and ER. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No relevant family medical history. No relevant tests done. Outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

They were keeping it out side and giving the injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (consumer). A 79-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose in the arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. This patient reports receiving his first injection of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and experiencing some arm pain where the injection was given. Also he just noticed that when the nurse was going to give it to him that she had the syringe with the vaccine in it in her hand. She talked to him several minutes before administering. He thought this was supposed to be under 70 Degrees Fahrenheit. They were keeping it outside and giving the injection. He doesn&#39;t understand why they had it out in the weather. It was kind of warm in the state. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                rash worsened; compromised immune system with the Multiple Myeloma/ getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; compromised immune system with the Multiple Myeloma/ getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse for her husband. A 79-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 26Jan2021 06:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included plasma cell myeloma from Oct2018, a compromised immune system with the Multiple Myeloma, rash from Dec2020 and ongoing. The patient had a diagnosis of multiple myeloma and had developed a slight rash on his left arm to lenalidomide (REVLIMID) before receiving the COVID vaccine, Benadryl was taken and after 3 days, it was gone.  It was only on his upper arms. She said a rash was a known side effect of the lenalidomide. The nurse giving his vaccine shot noticed his slight rash on his left arm. Concomitant medication included lenalidomide (REVLIMID) for 2.5 years for multiple myeloma in remission. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The past drug included bortezomib (VELCADE), the patient was administered a chemo agent (bortezomib) at the oncology center every 2 weeks and the oncology center held off giving his chemo shot 2 weeks before he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine on 26Jan2021. The reporter said her husband would not restart the chemo shot until he sees his oncologist again. She clarified her husband has now been off the bortezomib for a month, as of 01Feb2021. The patient experienced rash worsened on 28Jan2021. By 28Jan2021 the rash had spread to his trunk and by 29Jan2021 to his back. She clarified his rash was a dry rash, with no blisters or oozing. Her first thought was to get an ointment or a spray. He has now been given prednisone instead of a dose pack and the rash was gone/ the rash cleared up almost immediately and will stop lenalidomide for a couple weeks and continue the round of prednisone. The doctor could alter his therapy as needed. On 04Feb2021, the rash was gone but her husband&#39;s doctor wants him to finish his prescribed course of Prednisone. She clarified the Prednisone (manufacturer: Actavis) 40 mg was started on 01Feb2021, the rash started fading fast. By the next day (Tuesday, 02Feb2021) the rash was really fading, and now (04Feb2021) the rash was totally not there. The doctor told her husband to take one Benadryl, and to continue taking the Benadryl if his rash itches. She said her husband&#39;s latest blood work didn&#39;t indicate anything.  She said her husband&#39;s labs were always off, but were normal for having Multiple Myeloma. Both doctors want to keep her husband off of the lenalidomide. Reporter seriousness was reported as medically significant . The patient was treated for Multiple Myeloma for the past 2-1/2 years. He had been doing well, and his cancer doctors approved of him getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. The oncologist wanted her to call Pfizer to see if she can find anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine and how it pertains to the lenalidomide and her husband&#39;s Multiple Myeloma. She said her husband was almost 80 years old and very active. She said her husband had been in remission Multiple Myeloma for a year and his blood work was fine. By the time her husband starts taking lenalidomide again, he would be off of lenalidomide for almost 4 weeks. She said her husband&#39;s oncologist said he was going to cut back her husband&#39;s lenalidomide milligram dose and change his lenalidomide frequency to every other day when he resumes the lenalidomide. The reporter checked her husband&#39;s blood pressure (130/76) on 29Jan2021, after his rash worsened. She saidnot require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The rash event outcome  his pulse was fine, and she tested his blood sugar and it was fine. She said he had no temperature, clarifying his temperature was 97.6. The event did was recovering. The drug result was reported as unrelated. The reporter and her husband&#39;s doctors don&#39;t think his rash has anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient asked if Pfizer can point her in any direction with regard to her husband&#39;s situation. She said she read the COVID-19 Vaccine is a dead virus, but wants to know if her husband should be cautious in getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said her husband&#39;s doctors know that the rash was not precipitated by the COVID-19 Vaccine, but his rash did get worse after he got the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. His second dose was due 16Feb2021. The reporter was wondering if she should delay the second dose of the vaccine, the vaccine would make the rash worse.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently provided, the rash worsened after 2 days following the vaccine use thus a contributory role of BNT162B2 might not be fully excluded towards the event onset.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product and Rash faded soon under Prednisone.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

I had cataract surgery on my left eye on March 17 but I don&#39;t think that had any bearing on me getting shingles. I have heard that others have developed shingles after being vaccinated for covid-19.  That is only hear say and i have no direct information about that, So far my case of shingles is moderate.

A 79-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Jan2021 at 14:15 (Lot Number: EL3248) as single dose; dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Feb2021 at 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6201) at the age of 79 years as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medication was not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 05Mar2021 the patient experienced chest pains, and cough, which required hospitalization from 05Mar2021 to 08Mar2021. The patient informed that he had some stress with son and daughter to point where he had some chest pains. After a week or two of conversation involving patients son and granddaughter culminated into this. The patient informed that when he went to the hospital because of chest pains, patient was already use to that and wasn&#39;t worried about it. The patient stated he didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital, called the doctor but because of Covid, the doctor wouldn&#39;t see the patient. The patient stated he shouldn&#39;t have been in the hospital at all. In terms of the cough, he simply called the doctor because the patient wanted cough medicine or something for that, temporary thing coming on. Patient stated the cough did not linger, and it was never treated.  The hospital got into the chest pain and jumped on the heart situation and patient thinks they saw dollar signs or something.  The patient wasn&#39;t very happy with them. The patient informed that he was given a blood thinner, Heparin IV during time hospitalized. The hospital decided to hold the patient over and they gave the patient Heparin IV for a good part of three days. The patient reported that he was discharged on 08Mar2021, and on 10Mar2021 the patient noticed the rash. The patient reporting experiencing rash after receiving both doses of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. The patient was thinking the combination of Plavix and heparin only three weeks after having the Pfizer Covid Vaccine could possibly be a side effect of rash. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rash. The doctor gave the patient Clobetasol Propionate and patient did treat rash with that.  The doctor said to apply for 2 weeks and come in on one week.  It has already improved. The patient mentions that he was also taking Calamine lotion and some spray and they all seem to be working.  Patient didn&#39;t want to keep taking Clobetasol because it is a steroid and he had been using for a month and didn&#39;t want to do that. The clinical outcome of rash was recovering. The clinical outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

This nurse reported similar events for two patients. This report refers to the husband.   An 80-year-old male patient received first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3246, expiry date: 30Apr2021, NDC number of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine: 59267- 1000-2), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 18:00 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included joint surgery which he just had one at the end of December of last year (2020) and had a procedure in Sep (unknown year); and prostate cancer which he had surgery February last year for this. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The nurse (patient&#39;s wife) reported that the patient received the Covid -19 Vaccine around 6 o&#39;clock on Wednesday evening. So basically 2 days ago and neither one of them seem to show any major reaction but yesterday sometime during the day, he started noticing a little bit of itching in his abdominal area and his back, no sign of whatsoever of a rash, there is no evidence of a rash at all but it is bothering him off and on today and she just didn&#39;t notice that was related in anyway. It&#39;s not in any of the paperwork we received and it&#39;s no rash and he is not having trouble breathing anything like that but he is having these periodic episodes of feeling itchy. When paraphrased the above concern, nurse stated, &#34;That&#39;s right, the back, basically yes and no other area right across the abdominal area and some occasionally little bit on his leg but more often on his back and it is not constant and there is no visible rash and he doesn&#39;t have a history of drug allergies. He is not one who generally reacts and he has no temperature, his vital signs are good. They just wanted to know if something we should be concerned about or whether there is been any report of this, she asked if they should call the doctor or what should they do. On 12Jan2021, the nurse called again and she stated that on 07Jan2021 (Thursday), the patient experienced random itching and continued in to Friday.  Furthermore, she stated that the day after he got the shot, and he is 80 with no history of drug reactions he had itching to his back, abdomen, some to the upper parts of his legs/thigh area and had a little bit to his head clarified to being his scalp. She says that she went to the drug store and got him some Benadryl. She says her the itching went away then on Thursday, and the next day he works part time, so he went to work on Friday and it started again. He was better on Saturday. She would like to know if this is a possible side effect, or if there might be a problem with him getting second dose. She said that the itching was in random places, it was the second night that she gave him the Benadryl that knocked him out, clarified he was sleepy after taking the Benadryl. She says she never saw a rash on his skin, and Saturday the itching was mitigated considerably. She said on Friday night she had got a little nervous, since the patient is 80 and has some health issues but no issues with medications in the past to their knowledge. He was better the next day. She says she doesn&#39;t know if his itching was associated with the vaccine. Also reported that the patient received one injection to his left arm and his arm was black and blue afterwards. The outcome of the event &#34;Periodic episodes of feeling itchy/itching to his back, abdomen, some to the upper parts of his legs/thigh area and had a little bit to his head clarified to being his scalp&#34; was recovered on 09Jan2021; for event &#34;her husband received one injection to his left arm and his arm was black and blue&#34; was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021028800 same reporter/drug, different event

                                                rash on the belly; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  An 80-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s boss) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK9231) in the Hospital (a family member that works there and the worker&#39;s were allowed to pick one of their family members to give the vaccine to) via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 at 11:30 AM at a single dose on the left upper arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medication included simvastatin (manufacturer unknown), dutasteride (manufacturer unknown) and montelukast (manufacturer unknown) all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The reporter stated that her boss received the first dose on 10Jan2021 and developed a rash on the belly. She wanted to know if he could take the second dose as scheduled or if he needs to wait. He was scheduled in 3 weeks. He has a rash all over his belly and the doctor said it was like a reaction to the vaccine. She does not know if he has to go the ER or what. His primary care physician (PCP) ordered him Benadryl pills and ointment. The reporter confirmed that the patient was ordered both oral and ointment. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

An 80-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL0142) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on an unspecified date (about three weeks ago) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. The reporter noted that both she and her husband took the Covid vaccine about 3 weeks ago, stated is time to take the second part. She read the pamphlet that came with it when we got the vaccine, said that a person could have a bad body rash. She stated her husband has had a bad body rash on an unspecified date. Noticed the rash right away, maybe the day or two after and it has persisted since, it was a nightmare for him, that she thought it was shingles on unspecified date. They went to the dermatologist and he told them it could be attributed to him eating red meat. The reporter wanted to know what they should do for it. Investigation assessment was noted as no. The outcome of rash was not recovered and of shingles was unknown.

Nothing on the neck, face or head; very little on the back but heavy on the front torso.  (I have pictures). Not painful or itching. Took Benedryl for 2 days, no change.

He is scheduled for Feb 11 to get injection #2.  Should he or not?

A 81 years old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247 or EL3427), via an unspecified route of administration at Arm Left on 21Jan2021 09:33 at the 81 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   The medical history was none. The family medical history was none. The concomitant medications included warfarin from Mar2012 for Atrial fibrillation( AFib) and standard medications . The patient was not feeling well. All occurred on 21Jan2021 18:00, the patient developed symptoms, such as aches all over his body, aches all over with muscles pains with muscle pains, headache, joint pain, chills, injection site pain on left arm, body slightly warm, felt slightly warm, feeling unwell. He had chills all night and could not get warm. The reporter had not taken the patient&#39;s temperature yet. The patient takes regular medications. The patient was on warfarin and standard medications. The reporter stated the vaccine cards were mixed up because they did not write their names on them and the vaccine lot numbers looks like they were mixed up. Someone probably made a mistake because one says EL3247 and the other says EL3427, so she is not sure which it is. The handwriting is different on the cards. There was no Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was not Emergency Room Visit or physician&#39;s office required Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event was not recovered.

The patient also started to receive mirtazapine (MIRTAZAPINE, 50 mg, Capsule, soft), via an unspecified route of administration, from an unspecified date at 50 mg, once a day for sleep. Medical history included sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], calcium, escitalopram, finasteride, lamotrigine, simvastatin, tamsulosin. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported receiving the Pfizer vaccine in his right arm on 06Feb2021. That evening he took his nightly medication and went to bed at 11:30 pm. He stated he wasn&#39;t able to sleep because he felt like he was in a refrigerator and he was shaking. He had lower back pain, right arm/shoulder pain, and went to the bathroom 5 times (all on an unspecified date in Feb2021), which was not normal for him. The patient added that it was the second dosage of the Pfizer (Covid-19 Vaccine) her received on 06Feb2021. And he had some negative response: a little pain in his shoulder but the worst thing that happened, he went to bed 11:30 did not sleep at all. At 11:30 night, he took his medication (Mirtazapine) and went to bed. He was shaking and he had to put another blanket on himself. Eventually, it was okay, but the problem is he was not able to sleep all night, from 11:30 to 9&#39; O clock this morning (07Feb2021). Consumer stated, &#34;Yesterday my wife and I had the second dose of the Pfizer and I had really strange reaction and I will tell you what it was. Last night at about 11:30 I took my night medicine (later clarified as Mirtazapine), I went to bedroom, I started shaking all over. And the worst part is from 11:30 to 10 o&#39; clock this morning, I was not able to sleep. There is slight pain in my shoulder&#34;. When confirmed if the consumer wanted to report the same or have any questions, consumer stated, &#34;No, we have no problem with temperature is fine, the oxygen is fine. Just I don&#39;t understand why in fact the medication (mirtazapine) is to induce sleeping, use to for sleep within half hour but it didn&#39;t help. I wanted to know what happened. So, this will eventually go away?&#34; The action taken in response to the events for mirtazapine was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on batch number has been requested.

This morning, he got up at 6am and his temperature was around 98.8; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9261; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 26Jan2021 at 8:30 to 9 AM, at a single dose, for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history in Mar2020 included had a temperature for 7 days. He tested positive for COVID and it took a while to test negative. At the end of Mar2020 until the first of Apr2020, his temperature was 97 something. He has checked his temperature every day since then. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. He did not receive additional vaccines on the same date bnt162b2 was given. The patient had his first COVID-19 shot yesterday morning about 8:30 or 9:00. He hadn&#39;t really looked at the list of side effects, but yesterday afternoon (26Jan2021), he had slight pain in the arm where the shot was given. If he moved his arm, he would have slight discomfort. The pain was mostly gone today. He also had some slight tenderness in his shoulder, but it&#39;s certainly less than what it was yesterday. He saw other things that were listed including fever. He wanted to know if Pfizer had any information as what to amount of fever people typically experience after having the shot.  Yesterday (unspecified date in Jan2021), his temperature was 97 something. This morning, he got up at 6 am and his temperature was around 98.8. And then he had to take his wife to therapy and when he got back 3 hours later, he took it now and his temperature was 99 degrees. He was just wondering if Pfizer had an idea of how much fever is normal from the shot?  He hasn&#39;t had any other reactions. The events did not require Emergency Room or Physician&#39;s Office visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 97 something on 26Jan2021, 98.8 and 99 on 27Jan2021; sars-cov-2 test: positive on an unspecified date in 2020 and negative on an unspecified date in 2020. Outcome of the event &#34;slight pain in his arm the shot was given&#34; was recovering, while for the other events was unknown.

Dizziness gradually subsided and was completely gone after 20-25 minutes.  Additional note: several years ago experienced one episode of extreme benign postural vertigo, but experience after second dose of vaccine was milder and shorter in duration.

An 83-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose at age 83 years, on 25Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. Patient stated that he got the Pfizer COVID 19 Vaccine yesterday (25Feb2021) at noon and this morning (26Feb2021), he has a rash on the inside of his thigh. He clarifies well it is not a rash it is more like a hematoma, almost like discoloration of the skin, it doesn&#39;t hurt but he wants to see if this is something that normally occurs. He showered last night and didn&#39;t notice it until this morning. He only noticed it about a half hour ago so he is not sure if there is any difference. He clarifies the area on the inside of his thigh is a purplish color, like a bluish reddish but it is not red. It looks like a hematoma, like bleeding under the skin. There is no swelling, it is not raised and it doesn&#39;t hurt to touch, just there. He didn&#39;t call his primary about this. He got this information so his doctor does not know anything about it. If it is something to be concerned about he will run down to the emergency room but he will see if he can find the office contact info. Outcome of the events was not recovered. Case was reported as non-serious.

About an hour or less than an hour ago I woke up, and my whole body felt like it was itching. I mean my whole body was just feeling funny. I was itching all over, that went away, I took a pill a while ago for that. &#39;Lorazepam&#39; (not confirmed over the call), it&#39;s a nerve, anxiety pill and it kind of helped. But right now, my feet are numb and cold.&#34; For the laboratory test the patient stated that, &#34;Yes they did a lab test on me yesterday (02Mar2021) as I went to the emergency room with some heart problems.

This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: 2021125505) on 05-Feb-2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 08-Feb-2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of SMALL INTESTINAL HAEMORRHAGE (bleeding internally in small intestine) in 86-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) tablet for an unknown indication. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included Covid-19 Vaccine for Prevention. Product or product use issues identified: WRONG TECHNIQUE IN PRODUCT USAGE PROCESS (cut Eliquis in half). Concurrent medical conditions included Gout (diagnosed two or three years ago). On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (Oral) 2.5mg half tablet by mouth twice daily. On 07-Jan-2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (Intramuscular) intramuscular injection in right arm. Further treatment periods at the same dose started on 01-Feb-2021. In January 2021, the patient experienced RASH (rash on shoulder and neck). On an unknown date, the patient experienced SMALL INTESTINAL HAEMORRHAGE (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was treated with salicylic acid (Eucerin [Salicylic Acid]) for Rash. The action taken with Eliquis(Oral) was unknown. At the time of the report, SMALL INTESTINAL HAEMORRHAGE outcome was unknown and RASH did not resolve. Cardiologist recommended patient to take apixaban for palpitation of the heart that he has every so often. Eliquis at 2.5mg tablet twice a day and then patient found out he was bleeding to death, clarifies he was bleeding internally in his small intestine. So he cut his Eliquis in half and he was currently taking half of 2.5mg tablet twice a day. He got the Pfizer covidl19 shot. He has developed a rash on his shoulder and neck. He also stopped using his laundry soap since he was not sure if it was his laundry soap. For Eliquis(Oral), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.; Sender&#39;s Comments: BMS Medical Evaluation Comment: This patient had small intestine hemorrhage while on apixaban. Based on the anticoagulant nature of apixaban, its contributory role in small intestine hemorrhage is considered possible.

                                                First of all, the second dose may be FM - it was cut too close for me to tell.  His problem was severe itching across the back and down the back to below his waist.  Itching on shoulders and down below the underarm, some on legs/arms.  It started around the time of the vaccine and was starting to get better, then he got the second shot on Feb 10 and he&#39;s still itching today but not as bad.  He did see his heart doctor after the first shot and the nurse also had some itching.  We also went to see a dermatologist and he couldn&#39;t figure out what the cause was.  His back/shoulders/arms/legs had red splotches all over where the itching was.  Not exactly a rash but small up to medium sized - about the size of one&#39;s fingernail, and raised a little bit.  All this was why he went at least a month only taking his necessary heart medications and then he went back on the regular stuff but the itching is still there, although not as irritating now as before.

                                                Patient called our clinic to report swelling and redness of the left hand.  He said this symptom started several days after receiving the vaccine at an outside location.  Symptoms gradually worsened over the last few days until his hand became so swollen that it became difficult to make a fist and is impairing his activities of daily living.  Reaction seems to be localized to the hand and patient reports no other symptoms.

An 87-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiration date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration into the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (COVID prevention). The patient&#39;s medical history included Alzheimer&#39;s disease and stroke. There were no concomitant medications. The reporter was calling regarding his father who was an 87-year-old combat veteran. The reporter stated that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 12Jan2021. The patient was scheduled for his second dose on 02Feb2021, but they had to cancel that appointment because the patient was in the hospital from a fall he had on 29Jan2021 where he bruised his hip and bruised his rib. The patient was hospitalized from 30Jan2021 and was released from the hospital on 05Feb2021. The reporter stated that the clinic said they are not able to make any more appointments right now. The reporter was wondering if there were consequences of, or a danger in, getting the second dose outside of the recommended timeframe. The patient is now on a waiting list to get the second dose and he would like to know how far past the recommended 21 days can he go and still have the vaccine be effective. The patient received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient has had an MRI before where it was indicated that there were some spots from a past stroke. The reporter stated that no paralysis has been identified. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Some of the purpura was on the left arm and he had a few spots on the upper chest. Had no fever, no malaise, just what the patient described as blistering and so they had a dermatologist look at it. All seems to be improving. They were curious as to what this is. The patient feels fine and is ambulatory and the purpura does not itch. Caller does not provide seriousness criteria when queried. Initially it was thought, because the patient was on Eliquis for heart failure and atrial fib, that the Eliquis was related to events, but when the Dermatologist looked at it and stated it maybe excavation they decided to call and find out what Pfizer wanted them to do. Caller states he can give a list of medications if needed. Says patient had a comprehensive biochemical profile done non fasting also on 18Jan2021. Patient was seen by him initially on 19Jan2021. Wants to know whether this is a safety concern or/and if the patient should have the second dose. event requires a visit to physician office.

                                                he is coughing now; soreness in muscle on site on injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 88-year-old male patient (husband) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL9261, expiry date: May2021), intramuscular on 23Jan2021 11:30 AM at 0.3 mL, single on left deltoid (reported as &#34;0.3ml by IM (intramuscular) injection once to in left shoulder, the usual place&#34;) for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as &#34;88 and they are not anxious for him to get COVID/he has deep lung disease and if he didn&#39;t get it, he may die from it&#34;).  Vaccination facility type was a special clinic set up by hospital. Vaccine was not administered at facility. Medical history included deep lung disease, total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, asthmatic, lung problems. Patient has no compromised immune system. Patient&#39;s only allergic reaction was old tetanus (tetanus toxoid) but he was really fine. Patient had tetanus toxoid in 1950, he was a very young man and he has not had it since then, the reporter does not believe they give it anymore. No family medical history relevant to adverse events, also reported as &#34;No, but there is no history for the COVID vaccine, we are only 3 months into it&#34;. Concomitant medication included omalizumab (XOLAIR) for lung problems and asthmatic. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer product. After the first 3 days, patient got the vaccine on 23Jan2021. Patient is now on day 9 but the first 3 days after, he had no side effects. On the 4th day (27Jan2021), he developed soreness in his muscle on the site of injection, and the next day it was increasingly sore, on the 28Jan2021, 29Jan2021, 30Jan2021, and was quite incapacitated, he could not use it, it was really bad, now he was beginning to improve. The reporter wanted to Pfizer to know the length and depth. It only had to do with the use of the muscle not, he was not suffering when not using the arm, a couple days were really bad, he did feel it when he was not using it, but most of the time, the pain came when he needed to use it. The reporter talked to enough who said don&#39;t worry, but patient had a total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, in that arm and asked &#34;could that injection exacerbate anything going on there?  Most doctors said to not worry about it&#34;. The reporter wants to help COVID. The reporter got hers minute after his husband and she had no side effects whatsoever, so if there was any question about something going on at the site, she could not imagine hers would be so perfect. The event did not require emergency room and physician office visit, further reported that patient had multiple health issues. Patient was coughing now(01Feb2021), over the years, reporter has learned to deal with many things without going to Urgent Care, ER, patient was 88 and the reporter wanted to keep his husband out due to COVID. The reporter called friends who were medical doctors (MDs), as the reporter was worried, the patient was coming out of it. Patient has one injection, a new medication he was on a biologic. Patient was first refused to get the COVID vaccine due to biologic, and the day before he had received it, so they discussed and decided because of biologic, &#34;XOLAIR&#34;. There were no adverse events prior vaccinations. Patient went on Friday for his next Xolair, he had no problems then. There were no relevant tests and was reported that patient has been there the whole time, at home, has been under quarantine since last Mar2020. If anything threw up a red flag, reporter would think it would be something they would explore, maybe for the Xolair, when this question came up, it was several days before the vaccine, patient was refused. Patient was asked if there were other injections, reporter said that his husband would have &#34;one the one day before&#34;, and they canceled his appointment, and he went to the doctor, the pulmonologist, who administered Xolair, and reporter said that his husband was refused, the doctor said no, &#34;it&#39;s a biologic, he was giving it to patients having the COVID vaccine, there were no interactions, and reinstated approval and everything was a go&#34;. Outcome of the event &#34;soreness in muscle on site on injection&#34; was recovering while for coughing was unknown.

An 89-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3249, expiry date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration (injection) in the left arm on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 89-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was on unspecified concomitant medications. The patient stated he has been taking the same medications for several years, and he has had no problems with those. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day. The patient had his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 22Jan2021. He was due for his second shot on 12Feb2021. After he had the first shot, his body got itchy all over and it was still itchy. He also had little tiny pimples on his skin, and it was very uncomfortable. He was wondering if this was a known reaction to the product. He had no idea what to do to relieve the itching. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021, and the itching started either the next day or two days after getting the vaccine. His body became very itchy, and he was itchy all over. He was developing little red like pimples all different parts of his body; itchy bumps. The itching and pimples having continued through to now, and it seemed to get even more itchy in the evening at bedtime. Last night (unspecified date), he had it on the top of his feet down there, on the top and in between his toes. Those itchy bumps were all over, and he did not know if that was the Pfizer shot.  The patient tried different anti-itch creams on it, and that relieved it for a while, but then it came back. He used clobetasol propionate, but it had not worked. They stopped itch for a while but then it does not help. He tried some just plain anti-itch cream (clarified as Gold Bond Anti-Itch Cream) to stop the itching. It stopped itch for a while, but then it did not help. He did not have to use the cream until 3-4 days. It was some prescription from the doctor, but it was for his wife. He tried it, but it did not do anything. The patient stated the injection itself did not give him any problems. The patient was wondering whether he should take the second shot if this one gave him so much trouble. The clinical outcome of discomfort was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.
