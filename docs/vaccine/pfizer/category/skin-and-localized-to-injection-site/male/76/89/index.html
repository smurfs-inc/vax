                                                I write today because On January 20, I received my first Pfizer covid vaccination. I have felt no side effects but when I read the story of the doctor who died of bleeding after that vaccination, I became concerned because I do get minor petechiae from the blood thinner and then yesterday (1/25) I noticed a petechiae different from the rest. It was on my back and was bigger than the few tiny pinpoint ones from the medication.  I am wondering if the vaccine made the difference and if my platelet count is going down. Is it possible that the vaccine might interact with blood thinners and create Thrombocytopenia? I have never heard of that disease before, but I think it can exist unknown or maybe be started by the vaccine. I will be watching for any additional petechiae, but would it be good to get a platelet test to see if something has gone wrong? The doctor with zero platelets, no symptoms and death by bleeding has caused me concern and if blood thinners, my eczema or undiagnosed Thrombocytopenia cause issues for vaccines, that information would be good to know. I am a 76 year old male in generally good health. My fitbit walking target is at least 4 miles/day and I usually reach that. At 5? 9? and 172 pounds I enjoy golf weekly when winter is over. Two issues do exist. Twenty seven months ago while searching for the cause of some PVCs the doctors put in a stent and scarred a diagonal artery causing what they said was a heart attack. Recovery was quick and subsequent tests indicate the heart was healed and working fine. I have no heart symptoms, but since then have been on first Brillinta and now Clopidorgrel (Plavix) plus baby aspirin. Second, last August I was diagnosed with eczema which might be psoriasis which I think is autoimmune related.  It is annoying at times but the prescription cream helps.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL9262, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Jan2021 15:30 at a single dose for protection from the virus at the Physician Office. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2011 and ongoing. The patient also thought he had a Covid respiratory infection in Feb2020. He had a prolonged moderate to severe respiratory infection. He thought at first that he had the flu, but he had a flu shot. He thinks he had Covid. He had antibody studies in May2020 (last spring) that were negative. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient previously had influenza vaccine (flu shot). The patient reported hypothermia after getting the first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. On the same day of vaccination (26Jan2021), he had injection site tenderness. The next day, (27Jan2021), his arm was suddenly painful; he began to have chills 29 hours after receiving the vaccine (27Jan2021) and was shaking. He also had a temperature of 93.7 orally, confirmed with two different digital thermometers. He took his temperature with a new electronic thermometer that he purchased at a pharmacy. His temperature was 92.7 on 27Jan2021. He repeated it with another electronic thermometer. The first evening (27Jan2021), his temperature went to 96.5 to 98 degrees. Then it went down to 93.2 degrees. He covered up with blankets and his temperature increased and the chills stopped. He stated that this was hypothermia. He had low temperatures the following day (28Jan2021) as well, his temperature was 93-94 degrees. His temperature was 93.7 degrees. Other times he checked his temperature and it was 96.5 degrees. When his temperature was low the first time, it only lasted for about three hours. The second time it happened he went to bed and covered up. It lasted for an hour or two. He noticed it again two days ago. The patient also stated the arm he received the injection in was tender however progressed to mild to moderately painful when he experienced the chills and low temperatures. The arm tenderness after getting the vaccine was very mild. He noticed it when he rolled over on his arm. He took some Tylenol for it. His son is an internist. He said the hypothermia was medically significant. His son also said hypothermia is equivalent to a fever in the elderly. The patient wanted to know if there have been any reports of hypothermia after the administration of the vaccine. He has concerns about this occurring after the second dose. He is scheduled to receive the second dose on 15Feb2021 or 16Feb2021. The outcome of the event hypothermia was recovered on 30Jan2021 and pain in arm recovered on 27Jan2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown. The events hypothermia, arm pain and injections site tenderness were assessed as related to BNT16B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported hypothermia and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Right arm was barely sore where injection administered; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 78-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 17:05 at single dose in the right arm for vaccination. Medical history included eye vitamin/To maintain good eye health, eye disorder, Heart supplement, heart disorder and he had his last annual physical with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in Oct2020. He had his flu shot in Sep2020. Concomitant medication included ramipril taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s; atorvastatin taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s. He believes this is the generic product for Pfizer Lipitor; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN CHILDREN) taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s; ascorbic acid, tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc (AREDS) (also reported as &#34;Advanced Retinol Eye Study Disease&#34;) for eye vitamin/To maintain good eye health; bioflavonoids nos, lecithin, quercetin, ubidecarenone (CO-Q-10 PLUS) taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s for Heart supplement; and unspecified multivitamin taken daily and probably taken all his life, all ongoing. This patient reported he was administered his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 11Jan2021. There were no side effects; his right arm was barely sore where injection administered on 11Jan2021. Onset probably about 19:05-20:05 and he had recovered completely by the next morning when he woke. He had no discomfort during the night, no pain or throbbing, he felt very normal the next morning. He clarified that he has no medical conditions, no flu or illnesses of any other kind. He had his last annual physical with PCP in Oct2020; he has a twice yearly check-up with the Cardiologist that will be coming up soon. Stated that today is the 21st day and he is scheduled to get his second dose at 3:00pm. He asked how the incremental immunity builds up percentage wise after getting the first and second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He asked if there is any restriction or limitation on taking products like Tylenol, Advil or Aspirin before getting the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine; and if those products are ok to use to potentially treat side effects from the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine such as if patient has sore arm or something; and how soon after the second dose side effects can kick in-he believes the briefing documents he was given for the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine said 2-14 days. He asked this particularly because he has an hour drive home after this second dose and wanted to know what to anticipate before attempting to drive home. His wife thought someone told her not to take any Tylenol, Advil or Aspirin before getting the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine which they had not heard of elsewhere, and saw no mention of that in the briefing documents given for the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The with outcome of the event was recovered on 12Jan2021.

                                                Rash is itching; rash under his arms from armpit to elbows underneath and on his sides below his belly button and in the groin area and on his buttocks; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 02Jan2021 00:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hard of hearing, surgery to remove the cancer, cancer broke his arm and he had a reverse shoulder replacement (medical conditions predating treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination); kidney failure that is better, muscle (disorder), blood pressure (abnormal), anxiety and radiation. The patient was previously given oxycodone, Ativan, and Xanax to take as needed after his surgery, but he has not taken them since Oct2020. Concomitant medication included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) for anxiety, amlodipine for blood pressure, metoprolol for blood pressure, tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX) from Sep2020 for kidney, carisoprodol (SOMA) from 22Oct2020 for muscle relaxant, ferrous sulfate, docusate sodium (STOOL SOFTENER), aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID]) all were ongoing and other unspecified products. The reporter stated that she and her husband got the vaccine on 02Jan2021 and the husband has developed a rash under his arm from his arm pit to elbow underneath, on his sides, below his belly button and in the groin area and on the buttocks. Rash was itching on 06Jan2021. She wanted to know could the COVID 19 vaccine cause this 4 days later. The patient noticed the itchy rash four days later on Wednesday afternoon 06Jan2021. He took Benadryl 25mg tablet by mouth that night before bed and then in the morning and put over the counter itch relief cream on it so in the night around 0200AM not too long after taking the Benadryl, the rash went away, pretty much gone. Today it seems to have come back and now it was worse because he has it on his buttocks. He didn&#39;t have it there at first. Mentioned that the patient also took a cool shower before going to bed. Wife mentioned that she just looked the rash right now and it was improved. Asking should he continue taking his relief or stop and let the doctor look at it? Advised caller to consult HCP. He is planning to get the next vaccine 23Jan2021. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The events did not require a visit to physician office and ER. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No relevant family medical history. No relevant tests done. Outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                rash worsened; compromised immune system with the Multiple Myeloma/ getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; compromised immune system with the Multiple Myeloma/ getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse for her husband. A 79-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 26Jan2021 06:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included plasma cell myeloma from Oct2018, a compromised immune system with the Multiple Myeloma, rash from Dec2020 and ongoing. The patient had a diagnosis of multiple myeloma and had developed a slight rash on his left arm to lenalidomide (REVLIMID) before receiving the COVID vaccine, Benadryl was taken and after 3 days, it was gone.  It was only on his upper arms. She said a rash was a known side effect of the lenalidomide. The nurse giving his vaccine shot noticed his slight rash on his left arm. Concomitant medication included lenalidomide (REVLIMID) for 2.5 years for multiple myeloma in remission. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The past drug included bortezomib (VELCADE), the patient was administered a chemo agent (bortezomib) at the oncology center every 2 weeks and the oncology center held off giving his chemo shot 2 weeks before he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine on 26Jan2021. The reporter said her husband would not restart the chemo shot until he sees his oncologist again. She clarified her husband has now been off the bortezomib for a month, as of 01Feb2021. The patient experienced rash worsened on 28Jan2021. By 28Jan2021 the rash had spread to his trunk and by 29Jan2021 to his back. She clarified his rash was a dry rash, with no blisters or oozing. Her first thought was to get an ointment or a spray. He has now been given prednisone instead of a dose pack and the rash was gone/ the rash cleared up almost immediately and will stop lenalidomide for a couple weeks and continue the round of prednisone. The doctor could alter his therapy as needed. On 04Feb2021, the rash was gone but her husband&#39;s doctor wants him to finish his prescribed course of Prednisone. She clarified the Prednisone (manufacturer: Actavis) 40 mg was started on 01Feb2021, the rash started fading fast. By the next day (Tuesday, 02Feb2021) the rash was really fading, and now (04Feb2021) the rash was totally not there. The doctor told her husband to take one Benadryl, and to continue taking the Benadryl if his rash itches. She said her husband&#39;s latest blood work didn&#39;t indicate anything.  She said her husband&#39;s labs were always off, but were normal for having Multiple Myeloma. Both doctors want to keep her husband off of the lenalidomide. Reporter seriousness was reported as medically significant . The patient was treated for Multiple Myeloma for the past 2-1/2 years. He had been doing well, and his cancer doctors approved of him getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. The oncologist wanted her to call Pfizer to see if she can find anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine and how it pertains to the lenalidomide and her husband&#39;s Multiple Myeloma. She said her husband was almost 80 years old and very active. She said her husband had been in remission Multiple Myeloma for a year and his blood work was fine. By the time her husband starts taking lenalidomide again, he would be off of lenalidomide for almost 4 weeks. She said her husband&#39;s oncologist said he was going to cut back her husband&#39;s lenalidomide milligram dose and change his lenalidomide frequency to every other day when he resumes the lenalidomide. The reporter checked her husband&#39;s blood pressure (130/76) on 29Jan2021, after his rash worsened. She saidnot require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The rash event outcome  his pulse was fine, and she tested his blood sugar and it was fine. She said he had no temperature, clarifying his temperature was 97.6. The event did was recovering. The drug result was reported as unrelated. The reporter and her husband&#39;s doctors don&#39;t think his rash has anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient asked if Pfizer can point her in any direction with regard to her husband&#39;s situation. She said she read the COVID-19 Vaccine is a dead virus, but wants to know if her husband should be cautious in getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said her husband&#39;s doctors know that the rash was not precipitated by the COVID-19 Vaccine, but his rash did get worse after he got the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. His second dose was due 16Feb2021. The reporter was wondering if she should delay the second dose of the vaccine, the vaccine would make the rash worse.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently provided, the rash worsened after 2 days following the vaccine use thus a contributory role of BNT162B2 might not be fully excluded towards the event onset.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product and Rash faded soon under Prednisone.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

If he moved his arm, he would have slight discomfort. The pain was mostly gone today. He also had some slight tenderness in his shoulder, but it&#39;s certainly less than what it was yesterday. He saw other things that were listed including fever. He wanted to know if Pfizer had any information as what to amount of fever people typically experience after having the shot.

And then he had to take his wife to therapy and when he got back 3 hours later, he took it now and his temperature was 99 degrees. He was just wondering if Pfizer had an idea of how much fever is normal from the shot?  He hasn&#39;t had any other reactions. The events did not require Emergency Room or Physician&#39;s Office visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 97 something on 26Jan2021, 98.8 and 99 on 27Jan2021; sars-cov-2 test: positive on an unspecified date in 2020 and negative on an unspecified date in 2020.

He clarifies well it is not a rash it is more like a hematoma, almost like discoloration of the skin, it doesn&#39;t hurt but he wants to see if this is something that normally occurs. He showered last night and didn&#39;t notice it until this morning. He only noticed it about a half hour ago so he is not sure if there is any difference. He clarifies the area on the inside of his thigh is a purplish color, like a bluish reddish but it is not red. It looks like a hematoma, like bleeding under the skin. There is no swelling, it is not raised and it doesn&#39;t hurt to touch, just there. He didn&#39;t call his primary about this. He got this information so his doctor does not know anything about it. If it is something to be concerned about he will run down to the emergency room but he will see if he can find the office contact info. Outcome of the events was not recovered. Case was reported as non-serious.

For Eliquis(Oral), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.; Sender&#39;s Comments: BMS Medical Evaluation Comment: This patient had small intestine hemorrhage while on apixaban. Based on the anticoagulant nature of apixaban, its contributory role in small intestine hemorrhage is considered possible.

An 87-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiration date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration into the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (COVID prevention). The patient&#39;s medical history included Alzheimer&#39;s disease and stroke. There were no concomitant medications. The reporter was calling regarding his father who was an 87-year-old combat veteran. The reporter stated that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 12Jan2021. The patient was scheduled for his second dose on 02Feb2021, but they had to cancel that appointment because the patient was in the hospital from a fall he had on 29Jan2021 where he bruised his hip and bruised his rib. The patient was hospitalized from 30Jan2021 and was released from the hospital on 05Feb2021. The reporter stated that the clinic said they are not able to make any more appointments right now. The reporter was wondering if there were consequences of, or a danger in, getting the second dose outside of the recommended timeframe. The patient is now on a waiting list to get the second dose and he would like to know how far past the recommended 21 days can he go and still have the vaccine be effective. The patient received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient has had an MRI before where it was indicated that there were some spots from a past stroke. The reporter stated that no paralysis has been identified. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                he is coughing now; soreness in muscle on site on injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 88-year-old male patient (husband) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL9261, expiry date: May2021), intramuscular on 23Jan2021 11:30 AM at 0.3 mL, single on left deltoid (reported as &#34;0.3ml by IM (intramuscular) injection once to in left shoulder, the usual place&#34;) for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as &#34;88 and they are not anxious for him to get COVID/he has deep lung disease and if he didn&#39;t get it, he may die from it&#34;).  Vaccination facility type was a special clinic set up by hospital. Vaccine was not administered at facility. Medical history included deep lung disease, total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, asthmatic, lung problems. Patient has no compromised immune system. Patient&#39;s only allergic reaction was old tetanus (tetanus toxoid) but he was really fine. Patient had tetanus toxoid in 1950, he was a very young man and he has not had it since then, the reporter does not believe they give it anymore. No family medical history relevant to adverse events, also reported as &#34;No, but there is no history for the COVID vaccine, we are only 3 months into it&#34;. Concomitant medication included omalizumab (XOLAIR) for lung problems and asthmatic. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer product. After the first 3 days, patient got the vaccine on 23Jan2021. Patient is now on day 9 but the first 3 days after, he had no side effects. On the 4th day (27Jan2021), he developed soreness in his muscle on the site of injection, and the next day it was increasingly sore, on the 28Jan2021, 29Jan2021, 30Jan2021, and was quite incapacitated, he could not use it, it was really bad, now he was beginning to improve. The reporter wanted to Pfizer to know the length and depth. It only had to do with the use of the muscle not, he was not suffering when not using the arm, a couple days were really bad, he did feel it when he was not using it, but most of the time, the pain came when he needed to use it. The reporter talked to enough who said don&#39;t worry, but patient had a total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, in that arm and asked &#34;could that injection exacerbate anything going on there?  Most doctors said to not worry about it&#34;. The reporter wants to help COVID. The reporter got hers minute after his husband and she had no side effects whatsoever, so if there was any question about something going on at the site, she could not imagine hers would be so perfect. The event did not require emergency room and physician office visit, further reported that patient had multiple health issues. Patient was coughing now(01Feb2021), over the years, reporter has learned to deal with many things without going to Urgent Care, ER, patient was 88 and the reporter wanted to keep his husband out due to COVID. The reporter called friends who were medical doctors (MDs), as the reporter was worried, the patient was coming out of it. Patient has one injection, a new medication he was on a biologic. Patient was first refused to get the COVID vaccine due to biologic, and the day before he had received it, so they discussed and decided because of biologic, &#34;XOLAIR&#34;. There were no adverse events prior vaccinations. Patient went on Friday for his next Xolair, he had no problems then. There were no relevant tests and was reported that patient has been there the whole time, at home, has been under quarantine since last Mar2020. If anything threw up a red flag, reporter would think it would be something they would explore, maybe for the Xolair, when this question came up, it was several days before the vaccine, patient was refused. Patient was asked if there were other injections, reporter said that his husband would have &#34;one the one day before&#34;, and they canceled his appointment, and he went to the doctor, the pulmonologist, who administered Xolair, and reporter said that his husband was refused, the doctor said no, &#34;it&#39;s a biologic, he was giving it to patients having the COVID vaccine, there were no interactions, and reinstated approval and everything was a go&#34;. Outcome of the event &#34;soreness in muscle on site on injection&#34; was recovering while for coughing was unknown.

He also had little tiny pimples on his skin, and it was very uncomfortable. He was wondering if this was a known reaction to the product. He had no idea what to do to relieve the itching. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021, and the itching started either the next day or two days after getting the vaccine. His body became very itchy, and he was itchy all over. He was developing little red like pimples all different parts of his body; itchy bumps. The itching and pimples having continued through to now, and it seemed to get even more itchy in the evening at bedtime. Last night (unspecified date), he had it on the top of his feet down there, on the top and in between his toes. Those itchy bumps were all over, and he did not know if that was the Pfizer shot.  The patient tried different anti-itch creams on it, and that relieved it for a while, but then it came back. He used clobetasol propionate, but it had not worked. They stopped itch for a while but then it does not help. He tried some just plain anti-itch cream (clarified as Gold Bond Anti-Itch Cream) to stop the itching. It stopped itch for a while, but then it did not help. He did not have to use the cream until 3-4 days. It was some prescription from the doctor, but it was for his wife. He tried it, but it did not do anything. The patient stated the injection itself did not give him any problems. The patient was wondering whether he should take the second shot if this one gave him so much trouble. The clinical outcome of discomfort was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.
