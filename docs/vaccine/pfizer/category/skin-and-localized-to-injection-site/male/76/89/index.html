Lasted about 45 minutes.  took Advil and used the CPAC to calm my breathing down.  Then slept until 9:00 am.  But after I woke, I felt tired the rest of the day.  I am doing fine now.  I am not sure if this was a side effect of the covid vaccine or not. But I thought I let you know.

                                                I write today because On January 20, I received my first Pfizer covid vaccination. I have felt no side effects but when I read the story of the doctor who died of bleeding after that vaccination, I became concerned because I do get minor petechiae from the blood thinner and then yesterday (1/25) I noticed a petechiae different from the rest. It was on my back and was bigger than the few tiny pinpoint ones from the medication.  I am wondering if the vaccine made the difference and if my platelet count is going down. Is it possible that the vaccine might interact with blood thinners and create Thrombocytopenia? I have never heard of that disease before, but I think it can exist unknown or maybe be started by the vaccine. I will be watching for any additional petechiae, but would it be good to get a platelet test to see if something has gone wrong? The doctor with zero platelets, no symptoms and death by bleeding has caused me concern and if blood thinners, my eczema or undiagnosed Thrombocytopenia cause issues for vaccines, that information would be good to know. I am a 76 year old male in generally good health. My fitbit walking target is at least 4 miles/day and I usually reach that. At 5? 9? and 172 pounds I enjoy golf weekly when winter is over. Two issues do exist. Twenty seven months ago while searching for the cause of some PVCs the doctors put in a stent and scarred a diagonal artery causing what they said was a heart attack. Recovery was quick and subsequent tests indicate the heart was healed and working fine. I have no heart symptoms, but since then have been on first Brillinta and now Clopidorgrel (Plavix) plus baby aspirin. Second, last August I was diagnosed with eczema which might be psoriasis which I think is autoimmune related.  It is annoying at times but the prescription cream helps.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 76-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration at the left deltoid on 26Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 26Jan2021. When he came home that day his left arm swelled up and had a knot at the injection site. States he went right out, clarifies he went to sleep for hours. The next day (27Jan2021) when he woke up, he rubbed the area and it was sore. Three days ago (30Jan2021), he started running out of breath, he would walk to the mailbox and have to stop since he was out of breath. He never had that happen before. He was not sure what it was or if something else going on. He would have no breath whatsoever if he gets up to walk. When he was sitting still he was ok. If he gets up to walk to the bathroom, he was out of breath by the time he gets to the bathroom. States he was not short of breath as long as he was not doing anything. States it was crazy though when he starts walking and he gets out of breath. This has never happened to him before. He does not know if it was the vaccine or something else. He saw the shortness of breath was one of the side effects. He wants to find out what he should do and if he should go to the hospital. Advised to contact hcp. He asks if he was supposed to go back for the second shot. He has an appointment with his doctor in the next two weeks for all the medications he takes. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 76-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number EL9263, expiry date not reported), intramuscular on 26Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included years ago he did have an issue with a lung disease when he went to (country name); he did have COVID 19 in Mar2020 and he recovered from that; high blood pressure; psoriatic arthritis diagnosed 30 years ago; and non-smoker. Family medical history included that they are all smokers in his family, and he is not. His sister died of pancreatic cancer and his mother died of oat cell lung cancer. Concomitant medications included valsartan (DIOVAN 160 mg) for high blood pressure at 160 mg, daily started 3.5 years ago to an unknown date; and patient was taking some health store vitamins. The patient previously took infliximab (REMICADE) on unspecified dates 5 years ago as Arthritis medication administered IV and apparently it lowered his immune system and he wound up in the hospital with a lung infection. He recovered completely. He does not have a lot or expiration. It was administered in the doctor&#39;s office and he does not go to that doctor anymore. It was reported that patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  He had second dose of Shingles vaccine and it was close to 4 weeks ago. Shingrix administered on upper left arm received it at an in-store clinic, and patient had slight injection site discomfort. No other vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient received the first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine on 26Jan2021 at noon, with just a bit of discomfort. He seemed to be fine except slight injection site discomfort, also reported as injection site discomfort on left upper arm, on 26Jan2021. Later that night (also reported as last night 26Jan2021 23:00) he felt achy, he had bad body aches and pain and still has it this morning. Injection site pain worsened last night and now it has improved. He woke up in the middle of the night, and had a fever 99.7 F, 99.9 fever and later it went as high as 101 F (26Jan2021). He took Advil and Tylenol. The body aches improved after he took 2 Tylenol when he took his temperature. He took temperature about 1.5 hour ago. He went into bed and waited and took it again about 1/2 hour ago and it went up to 101. He then took Tylenol and took his temperature again. This morning (27Jan2021) his temperature was now back/down to 99.3 F. He was still feeling aches but not as bad as before. He might still have a slight temperature now, but it has improved. He believed vaccination was given in the muscle because it was in the upper part of his arm where the skin is thinner. He had a slight headache and was quite tired (27Jan2021). Patient asked if there&#39;s anything he should do or be concerned about. He was scheduled for the second dose on 16Feb2021 and he heard that the second dose was stronger than the first one, that after the second dose there may be more side effect, and he wanted to know if this is true and wanted to know if he can get the second dose. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events discomfort/slight injection site discomfort, he felt achy/body aches and pains, fever, and injection site pain. Patient had no ER or physician&#39;s office required. The events discomfort/slight injection site discomfort, he felt achy/body aches and pains, fever, and injection site pain were recovering. The outcome of the event tired and headache was unknown.

Also both my arms are stiff and i have some pain. I got the injection on the Left arm but the Right arm feels the same. I spoke with my doctor he told me to put bacitracin on it for few days but it&#39;s still there. It&#39;s less itchy but the red dot is still there its 2-3 inches from the injection site and also said, I think I&#39;m going to skip the second dose. A red sore developed under the band aid that was applied to cover the injection site. It is under the right edge of the band aid. The area where the exact needle penetrated is healed. Both arms are sore at the top by where they meet the shoulder. Outcome of the events were not recovered.

A 76-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was not reported. The patient had two side effects and the second shot would be coming up and he was nervous about what he should do. The main side effect is that they put a band aid on where injection was to protect site. The next morning, he took it off and on the edge of the band aid, there was a red dot about 1/8 to 1/4 inch around. It was itchy like crazy, he did not scratch it. That dot was staying there. The doctor told him not to do anything to it and just put a little bacitracin on it. He did not provide any information for the Bacitracin such as a dose, lot or expiration. The next side effect was both of his arms which was stiff and achy at the top. The injection arm feels exactly like the right, but only the left one got the injection. He would like to know if he should be concerned with second dose or not. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I had the second shot at the same place on 2-11-21. At the time, I only had soreness of the left arm at the injection site and virtually no other symptoms except a mild headache for a few hours.  However, during the month or so between the vaccines and post-vaccine period, I developed pain in both shoulders with moderate-severe rotator cuff symptoms. This was pain in reaching in almost any direction. Also, I began to notice heaviness in both upper legs, front and back, which in a week or so progressed to tiredness and then to achiness, and finally to pain when I would squat, bend over, or get up from a chair. I have  never had either symptom before.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 76-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 intramuscular on 25 Feb 2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at clinic. Medical history included hypertension, blood cholesterol increased, myocardial infarction, colon cancer (had surgery for that and also had chemotherapy), coronary artery disease (30% blocked coronary artery), covid-19 from 19May2020 to an unknown date. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril for hypertension; amlodipine; rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol increased; evolocumab (REPATHA), subcutaneously at 140 mg (twice a month) for blood cholesterol increased. The patient reported, he was diagnosed positive with COVID-19 on 27May2020 from which he seem to have recovered without any residues of symptoms or side effect. He received first Pfizer COVID vaccination at noon time this past Thursday 25Feb in a vaccination clinic set up, the following day Friday the 26 he woke up the next morning and entire body was so sore from head to toe and could hardly get himself out of bed, but when he got up, he was having difficulty walking, so anyway he stayed in bed all day on 26 and 27. He initially had a slight temperature, some chills, slight cough, runny nose and those symptoms except for the cough seem to have resolved, what hasn&#39;t resolved is about every 30 or 40 minutes or so he had been having to urinate ever since 26Feb2021 night, his mouth has been constantly very dry. Still urinating every half hour 45 minutes and ongoing. Mouth has been very dry and had a couple of areas where it seems like maybe he had bit his lip or something, maybe when he was sleeping. It was nothing like that in mouth anymore but the mouth is still constantly so dry like dehydrated and no matter how much of fluid he drank that doesn&#39;t seem to help it and what in fact has also caused was on yesterday morning he had been a little constipated on Friday night and then yesterday morning had a severe case of diarrhea. Now he had not had another bowel movement since yesterday morning as no appetite and feeling so lousy, and so tired and fatigued. He had been feeling even much worse since getting the vaccine. He still feels very fatigued, very sore all over, very tired, still have the slight cough and he would say that&#39;s about it. Outcome of events for cough, pain and tiredness was not recovered and for the rest of the events it was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 76-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Mar2021 (Lot Number: EM9809) at the age of 76 years old as single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Bypass surgery from 2014, stent placement from 2014 (got this within 2 days of his bypass), Diabetic from 2001 and ongoing; viral infection warts on his right arm from 2020 (had been there about a year) that were 3/8 of an inch to a half inch thick, and were always hanging on stuff. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified medication (patient had been on the same meds for years. No further details provided about his other medications). Caller said he had no recent vaccinations the day of or four weeks prior to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses. Caller had his first dose of the covid-19 vaccine on 17Mar2021, caller stated that he had three big warts on his arm that he was going to have removed at the dermatologist, three days after receiving the vaccine the first wart was gone (Mar2021), the next day the second wart came off and the 3rd day the last wart was still anchored but was pulled off while working on the lawn mower, caller had his second dose (lot number: ER2613) on 07Apr2021. Consumer calling about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot, not to complain, he was actually happy they were gone. Caller clarified that he had viral infection warts on his right arm that were 3/8 of an inch to a half inch thick, and were always hanging on stuff. He said he went to a dermatologist for cancers and showed him those and they said for him to make an appointment to come back for insurance, and that they would probably have to take them off. He said after he got the first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine dose, three days later one came off and then another started peeling up off his skin. He said that the third one was peeling up at the edges after the other one turned loose when he bumped it on the deck, so he pulled up on it and tore it off and it bled a little, but it is gone and hasn&#39;t come back, so he was proud of it. He says he didn&#39;t know if the warts coming off was because of vaccine, but when he took care of warts before he had them removed in the past or burned off. He said that he wanted to give Pfizer the information in case they could use the same medication to help with getting rid of warts without having them removed. He said he was proud the warts are gone, he didn&#39;t know if any others had this reaction to this medication, where their warts come off. He said other than this he just had a little soreness to his arm after injections in Mar2021. He said maybe they can make a cream or something to put on warts to make them come off. He said he didn&#39;t know if call handler ever experienced warts like this, but he had some burned off years ago, and they sell a wart remover that was smelly that you have to get on the wart that was an acid. No further details provided about the wart remover. He says maybe the could use the COVID vaccine to develop something with this pur-pose. For viral infection warts came off: Caller said that his warts he first had a while back, he knew they were on there the last time he went to see his dermatologist because he asked about them. He said he usually went to see his dermatologist between October and December at the end of every year, so those warts had been there about a year. He said that he noticed the first wart was gone within 3-4 days after his first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot, and they were all gone within about 5-6 days, they were gone way before he went back for his second dose. He said he thought it was great they were gone. For injection site soreness: Caller said his arm soreness went away within 3-4 days, after the first dose it took 3 days, and after the second shot it took an extra day, so about 4 days. He said he did no treatment for the arm soreness. Caller says that the only thing that his viral warts coming off could be associated with was the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, and he was happy that they did come off. Description of complaint: Unexpected therapeutic benefit. No Investigation Assessment. The outcome of the event &#34;a little soreness to his arm after injections/ injection site soreness/ arm soreness&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date, of the other events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Feb 3, 2021.  Five days after first vaccination, had severe dizziness upon awakening.  Could barely stand up.  Dizziness and lightheadedness has persisted on and off for almost two months.  Felt much better for about 3 weeks and then it re-occurred and continues to this day (5/3/21).  On the evening of 4/29/21, actually passed out and hit the floor incurring head laceration.  Epley procedures have had no effect.  Doctors have not found cause.  Cardiologist has me starting on a monitor, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the issue.  Dizziness comes and goes and is not always present.  Have never experienced these symptoms before.  No history of vestibular problems.  Very distressing.

This physician reported for a 76-year-old male patient that he received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: Unknown, expiration date: not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Jun2021 (Exact date of the first vaccine unknown, it was about 7 days ago) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunisation (at the age of 76-year-old). The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE, and after about 24 hours on an unspecified date in Jun2021, developed pink-red feet with swelling, especially toes and especially great toes, very similar to Covid foot- toes that been seen with the actual disease, had improved significantly since then, now the question was he needed the second vaccine and were worried about the above reaction to the first dose of vaccine. The patient&#39;s feet were swollen and red and typically for Covid toes (start date: Jun2021). The patient had Covid feet (start date: Jun2021), and the toes were involved. It was reported that slowly it had improved significantly, but the patient was due for his second shot and he was worried about if he will have more issues with the second shot. The patient had significantly improved, about 90% improved and could get the information about the Covid vaccine later if needed. The patient wanted to get some help and information with how to proceed with the second vaccination. Reporter&#39;s seriousness for the events was medically significant. The outcome of both the events was resolving.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the plausible temporal relationship, the association between the events of swelling of feet and redness and the suspect product of BNT162B2 cannot be completely ruled out.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL9262, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Jan2021 15:30 at a single dose for protection from the virus at the Physician Office. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2011 and ongoing. The patient also thought he had a Covid respiratory infection in Feb2020. He had a prolonged moderate to severe respiratory infection. He thought at first that he had the flu, but he had a flu shot. He thinks he had Covid. He had antibody studies in May2020 (last spring) that were negative. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient previously had influenza vaccine (flu shot). The patient reported hypothermia after getting the first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. On the same day of vaccination (26Jan2021), he had injection site tenderness. The next day, (27Jan2021), his arm was suddenly painful; he began to have chills 29 hours after receiving the vaccine (27Jan2021) and was shaking. He also had a temperature of 93.7 orally, confirmed with two different digital thermometers. He took his temperature with a new electronic thermometer that he purchased at a pharmacy. His temperature was 92.7 on 27Jan2021. He repeated it with another electronic thermometer. The first evening (27Jan2021), his temperature went to 96.5 to 98 degrees. Then it went down to 93.2 degrees. He covered up with blankets and his temperature increased and the chills stopped. He stated that this was hypothermia. He had low temperatures the following day (28Jan2021) as well, his temperature was 93-94 degrees. His temperature was 93.7 degrees. Other times he checked his temperature and it was 96.5 degrees. When his temperature was low the first time, it only lasted for about three hours. The second time it happened he went to bed and covered up. It lasted for an hour or two. He noticed it again two days ago. The patient also stated the arm he received the injection in was tender however progressed to mild to moderately painful when he experienced the chills and low temperatures. The arm tenderness after getting the vaccine was very mild. He noticed it when he rolled over on his arm. He took some Tylenol for it. His son is an internist. He said the hypothermia was medically significant. His son also said hypothermia is equivalent to a fever in the elderly. The patient wanted to know if there have been any reports of hypothermia after the administration of the vaccine. He has concerns about this occurring after the second dose. He is scheduled to receive the second dose on 15Feb2021 or 16Feb2021. The outcome of the event hypothermia was recovered on 30Jan2021 and pain in arm recovered on 27Jan2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown. The events hypothermia, arm pain and injections site tenderness were assessed as related to BNT16B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported hypothermia and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Treatment: Prescriptions  for Valcyclovir and Gabapentin.

                                                Following Dose 1,  Right Arm became sore at injection site for 4 days, at which time Right armpit became very tender touch and was swollen about size of silver dollar, approx. 1/2 inch thick.  Soreness at injection site subsided over the next 17 days, but tenderness in armpit only diminished slightly.  Following Dose 2, Right Arm was once again sore at injection site for about 4 days, but tenderness to the right armpit became more pronounced, with swelling increasing to the size of a hockey puck.  Size of swelling was easily visible to the eye.  Armpit became more tender to the touch, and has diminished only slightly in size,, as of this reporting.  Mass remains soft to the feel, but easily defined in size and location.  I have taken OTC pain killers to help with the discomfort.  Will continue to monitor its progress, unless notified otherwise.  Do not anticipate seeing my physician at this point.  Have consulted the Web, and have noted that this is a lesser side effect of this vaccine, if swelling remains localized to the injection site.  Thought I should report this side effect only because of the size of the swelling that occured.

By mid-afternoon had to go to bed and slept for hours. Got up at 9PM and went back to bed at 11PM. Sunday was better, but this AM (Monday) awakened with itchy skin, pins and needles on hands and feet (gone now) and total exhaustion. Had difficulty breathing (better now), can barely lift arms and had to miss work and went back to bed. I am reporting this because I am scheduled for a 2nd shot on the 26th and not certain it&#39;s a good idea.

Medical history included cholesterol. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) for cholesterol (besides that, everything was fine and the range was normal because he was taking the pills). The patient received his vaccination yesterday (06Feb2021) at a hospital. On 07Feb2021, the patient got a sore arm and it was somewhat inflamed at the site of the injection. The patient have taken paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient have checked the website and various other aspects. They said number 1, having a reaction like it was a good thing because it indicates his immune system was functioning as it should because of the foreign particle, which was encouraging and then it mentioned one should, if there was ice available put ice on the swelling to like cool down the inflammation and if one did not have the ice, one should use a cold wash support. The patient asked if that knowledge was a possible remedy. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Almost immediately felt swelling at the injection site, which I felt as being normal.  Next day when I woke up felt a slight headache , abnormal vision issues that included sparkles, blurred vision and a general tiredness. Did not feel refreshed as I normally do when I wake up in the morning. As the day went on sparkles and vision issues remained and headache got worse. Went to bed earlier than normal and next day when woke up the symptoms got worse, I felt like I had a migraine. Vision issues persisted. Laid down around 11AM and took a nap and when I woke up I noticed a blotch in my left eye reminiscent of the shape of a fish (looked like a shark) and it had different colors. Bright yellow and black almost kind of an iridescent green and orange. The shape was still just the colors were different.  I panicked and called the optometrist and explained what happened. They wanted to see me right away. I was able to be seen in the afternoon. They looked at it, did two tests and came with the diagnosis of a branch retinal artery occlusion.  I visited my neuro- ophthalmologist on 01/28 and he confirmed the diagnosis had previously given.  He then ordered fedrate and a couple of other tests. They also did a visual acuity in the left eye (20/30) and color vision (8/8 normal) and color plates and intraocular pressure (16 OS)

                                                Itchy pink splotches head to toe became noticeable irritation during the second night after the vaccination, confirmed in the morning. Went to urgent care the following Monday afternoon.  Consultation verified the symptoms.  Doctor concluded that the timing indicated a reaction to the vaccination rather than a reaction to the penicillin that I had been taking several days for a UTI.  I have never had any problems with any of the medications or supplements that I take regularly.  The doctor prescribed Prednisone, Cetirizine, and Tagamet, which I am currently taking.  There has not yet been any reduction in my extensive symptoms.

When he woke up the next morning he had tightness in his chest that last a while and then went away.  A couple of days later he had a dizzy spell which would come and go.  This lasted about 3 days.  He had another episode of tightness in his chest.  On 3/7/2021 he developed a red rash on his chest that had a hive in the middle of it that was itchy.  He started getting itchy spots on the top of his hands, fore arms, top of his ears, and the top of his head.   At this time he only has slight rash on his chest and shoulders that are not itching.

Seen in ambulatory clinic 7 days prior to presentation, given ibuprofen and percocet without relief. New swelling and erythema brought pt to hospital. Around time of vaccination, the pt was using triamcinolone for left forearm rash (described as small, more-spotty and resolved quickly). MRI revealed an abscess (10 x 6.8 x 1 cm) deep to the deltoid muscle and along the lateral aspect of the left proximal humerus. He also has another abscess within the posterior deltoid muscle (3.1 x 2.1 x 2.8 cm). There is surrounding myositis, fasciitis and cellulitis.

Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications including blood thinner and Afib medications. The patient takes 6 medications: some of those medications for 40 years, some for a bit less. There were a couple more added for his heart because 10 years ago he had a case of Afib and the doctor who has now retired took him from 3 meds to 6; and has had no issues for the last 10 years. The patient had his first dose on 19Feb2021 at a clinic and was due/scheduled for his second on 12Mar2021. The patient had severe reactions to the first one so he wanted to know if he should accelerate second shot or stay within three weeks. His reaction was for the first two weeks, he had severe nausea, etcetera, which was getting better that week. He gives 20-minute presentations each morning and the participants in the presentation were nice about it but they say that the patient has fog and thought he should see if he should go in sooner as they were worried about him. His only symptoms remaining after two weeks of severe reactions was that he was very sleepy. All that was left was being tired and mentally in a bit of fog (also reported as mental fog). The patient only had pain to the injection site for a day and was not an issue, then it didn&#39;t take long for him to start getting extremely tired and have nausea. He says all he knows was that from the sheet listing severe reactions, he had every one during the first couple weeks (unspecified), though he never had a fever. He says this week he felt better and he was starting to eat, this was not normal for him to be tired all the time, but at least he was not sick. He says he didn&#39;t treat the pain or nausea, because he was healthy as a horse, and has no problems with a vaccine, shots don&#39;t bother him other than having soreness the first day. The patient was just foggy and tired. The patient was recovering from nausea. The patient recovered from injection site pain on 20Feb2021. The patient has not recovered from mental fog/bit of fog and tired. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 77-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 77-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 26Jan2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EL9263) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included penicillin allergy. It&#39;s been 25-30 years ago and he can&#39;t take it. He gets swollen and hives and sick. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received a shingles shot about 5-6 years ago and flu shot Nov2020. The patient experienced soreness in the arm on 26Jan2021, back pain on 30Jan2021, so he thought it was just a pulled muscle on Feb2021, shingles on 15Feb2021. The patient received the first COVID shot on 26Jan2021 and didn&#39;t really have a reaction, but soreness in the arm a couple of days. He then started having back pain and he is a very active person so he didn&#39;t think anything of it. Spouse told him that he needs to see the doctor because she thought he had shingles. They do not know if it&#39;s associated to the COVID shot or not. They need to also cancel his appointment for tomorrow because the doctor does not want him to get his second COVID shot since he is on medication for the shingles. Mentions again, his arm was a little sore, but then 4 days after that he had back pain. He is an exceptionally active person, and excavation construction worker and still works and so he thought it was just a pulled muscle. Then a few days later, pain was awful and area was sensitive to touch and it looked a little swollen and he had nothing else. A couple days later he kept saying it bothered him and it was all the way around to his side. It was fine at first it started with a little rash and so he went to the doctor today and diagnosed with shingles. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of shingles which included valacyclovir (Was given Valacyclovir 1 gram tablet to take three times daily to help the shingles).

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Concomitant medications included romiplostim (NPLATE) for ITP. The patient stated he received his first dose of the vaccine on 15Jan2021, some soreness on 15Jan2021 afterwards but nothing that noticeable and about a week later on the 22Jan2021, the injection site started to inch and it got a red blotch about 2 inches in diameter. Just about it started a week after the injection. So, he was wondering if that was to be expected or was it unusual or how he should proceed. The events were reported as non-serious. No treatment received for events. Due date for the next shot was 05Feb2021. The outcome of event the injection site started to inch and it got a red blotch about 2 inches in diameter was not resolved, and of soreness was unknown.

A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL9261 with Expiration Date 31May2021), via intramuscular, on 22Jan2021 (at 09:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing restless legs syndrome and ongoing acid reflux. Relevant concomitant medications included omeprazole ongoing from an unknown date for acid reflux and gabapentin ongoing from an unknown date for restless legs syndrome. Her husband had the injection on Friday 22Jan2021. The next morning his left foot was swollen up really bad, red and tender and he could not walk on it. He has had problems like that before and he had it checked and was told it is not gout. It did not go away and she called the nurse on Sunday morning, and the nurse did not think it was a reaction and told her that a lot of times it is swelling in the lymph nodes. He was advised to go and see a podiatrist on Monday. He saw the podiatrist yesterday morning and the podiatrist gave him a one injection that contained Lidocaine, dexamethasone, and depomederol. After injection, the swelling right down and his foot was ok. The patient went to go get the Moderna injection and she asked those giving the injection if it was ok for her husband to get that injection from the podiatrist. She was told that people are not supposed to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) or ibuprofen. She was told that they did not think it was a good idea for her husband to get that injection from the podiatrist and it may have wiped out the benefit of the Pfizer COVID VACCINE. His foot was 95% recovered, he could walk on it and the swelling was down. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                Right arm was barely sore where injection administered; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 78-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 17:05 at single dose in the right arm for vaccination. Medical history included eye vitamin/To maintain good eye health, eye disorder, Heart supplement, heart disorder and he had his last annual physical with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in Oct2020. He had his flu shot in Sep2020. Concomitant medication included ramipril taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s; atorvastatin taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s. He believes this is the generic product for Pfizer Lipitor; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN CHILDREN) taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s; ascorbic acid, tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc (AREDS) (also reported as &#34;Advanced Retinol Eye Study Disease&#34;) for eye vitamin/To maintain good eye health; bioflavonoids nos, lecithin, quercetin, ubidecarenone (CO-Q-10 PLUS) taken for probably at least 15 years, started in his 60s for Heart supplement; and unspecified multivitamin taken daily and probably taken all his life, all ongoing. This patient reported he was administered his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 11Jan2021. There were no side effects; his right arm was barely sore where injection administered on 11Jan2021. Onset probably about 19:05-20:05 and he had recovered completely by the next morning when he woke. He had no discomfort during the night, no pain or throbbing, he felt very normal the next morning. He clarified that he has no medical conditions, no flu or illnesses of any other kind. He had his last annual physical with PCP in Oct2020; he has a twice yearly check-up with the Cardiologist that will be coming up soon. Stated that today is the 21st day and he is scheduled to get his second dose at 3:00pm. He asked how the incremental immunity builds up percentage wise after getting the first and second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He asked if there is any restriction or limitation on taking products like Tylenol, Advil or Aspirin before getting the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine; and if those products are ok to use to potentially treat side effects from the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine such as if patient has sore arm or something; and how soon after the second dose side effects can kick in-he believes the briefing documents he was given for the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine said 2-14 days. He asked this particularly because he has an hour drive home after this second dose and wanted to know what to anticipate before attempting to drive home. His wife thought someone told her not to take any Tylenol, Advil or Aspirin before getting the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine which they had not heard of elsewhere, and saw no mention of that in the briefing documents given for the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The with outcome of the event was recovered on 12Jan2021.

                                                There was a significant drug interaction with Efudex Cream that I was applying topically to a pre-cancerous 2-cm-diameter lesion on my left shin. On the day of my first Pfizer shot, the Efudex treated lesion was progressing normally from the desquamation (scabbing and shedding of epithelial scales) to the erosion stage (starting to form a shallow 2.5-cm-diameter ulcer). Starting about Saturday 30 January (three days after the first Pfizer shot) and slowly increasing for the next four days, the Efudex-treated ulcer became deeper, the peripheral 12-cm-diameter skin became redder, and the left foot and ankle became increasingly swollen.  My RN-wife and I (a former medical-research physicist) began research andChronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral. Chronic health conditions: nasal polyps, precancerous bleeding actinic keratoses, Cramp-Fasciculation Syndrome (leg &amp; foot cramps), early macular degeneration bilateral, hearing loss bilateral.DVERSE EFFECTS, TREATMENT, AND OUTCOME:  discovered that Efudex should not be given concurrently with any of a long list of immunizations.  This is an Efudex problem that should gain another immunization onto that list. Being within a week of finishing the Efudex regimen, we monitored the Efudex-treatment area and the peripheral area carefully. On Thursday 4 Feb (eight days after the first Pfizer shot), the ulcer began unusual drainage, the 12-cm-diameter peripheral area became inflamed, and swelling of the left ankle and foot increased to almost skin-tight - I can upload photos if you need.  Time for immediate action.  My excellent Dermatologist stopped Efudex and started me on Bactrim by mouth for 10 days, and Gentamicin topical antibiotic on the ulcerated central area and Triamcinolone topical corticosteroid on the peripheral and swollen areas for three weeks.  Good choices.  Improvement was immediate and continued improving for the next three weeks.  By the time of the second Pfizer shot on 24 February, the central area was healing well, in the late-reepithelialization stage (regrowth of epithelial tissue that now formed a completely-covering scar tissue with no oozing), and with all inflammation and swelling completely gone.  After the second Pfizer shot (taken 20 days after stopping Efudex), there were zero adverse effects of any kind. NOTE: There were absolutely zero other adverse effects of any kind throughout the entire series: no chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in pulse or blood pressure (120/70 range), loss of taste or smell, sore throat, cough, lung congestion, fatigue, feeling of being unwell, shortness of breath, injection-site swelling or redness, hives, swelling of face, decreased kidney function, or other adverse cardiovascular, neurological or pulmonary effects. There was no additional joint pain above my normal osteoarthritis.  After both shots, I felt a slight normal-range injection-site soreness for the next few hours, but no site swelling, rash, redness, or other problem.  We recommend that this immunization be added to the Efudex  proscribed or warned&#39; list.

                                                A little over a week ago I was admitted to a local hospital having been diagnosed with Guillain?Barré syndrome, a debilitating condition where the body?s auto immune system attacks the nervous system resulting in peripheral numbness in one?s hands, feet and legs. This condition was diagnosed by a neurologist. Following his diagnosis, I spent 8 days in the Hospital and was treated for 5 days with a daily dose of 400ml of immune globulin (IVIG) to rebuild the damage to my nervous system.   On April 10, I began to feel the onset of Guillain Barré syndrome as the bottoms of my feet suddenly began to tingle and feel numb. The next day I tripped while returning our waste management garbage cans to our garage.  Fell face forward onto the driveway and was bruised pretty bad.  The next day my BP zoomed to 224/160.  911 was called and I was taken to our local hospital fearing and thinking that I was having a heart attack.  I spent 4 days in the hospital being checked for a possible heart attack and all the while my Guillain Barré syndrome was progressing undiagnosed.  I was discharged and instructed to see a neurologist for the tingling and numbness in my hands, legs and feet.  Within 15 minutes of the neurologist consult,  a few days following my discharge, I was told I had Guillain Barré syndrome and get to a hospital. I left his office and went straight to the emergency room and I spent the next 8 days there and was discharged Tuesday, 4 May 2021. Several hospital neurologists treating me  believed the vaccination triggered the syndrome as do I.  It&#39;s not being widely reported even though there have been several Facebook postings of people saying the same thing as me.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). He couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination. He died at 5:30 a.m. on April 1, 2021.

A 78-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Feb2021 11:00 (at the age of 78 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Previously the patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 21Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3249; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced itching all over his body. States he took Benadryl regularly for the side effects but after 4-5 hours of taking the Benadryl, his symptoms returned. After a few days the itchiness resolved. States he went to allergist and received a prescription for prednisone, epipen and Benadryl with instructions for use by allergist. He was instructed to take Benadryl prior to the 2nd shot of the vaccine. He was instructed to take Benadryl if reaction post vaccine shot was mild and instructed to use epipen and call if he had a bad reaction. Also instructed to take Prednisone if Benadryl was not working. Received his second vaccine shot yesterday and, in the afternoon, developed a sun burning sensation on his skin in addition to itchiness and a welt on his stomach. The patient took Benadryl and within 30 mins symptoms resolved. He had had to take Benadryl regularly (every 4-5 hours) as his symptoms returned about 4 hours after a dose of Benadryl. States he has not needed the epipen or prednisone and would like to know if Benadryl deactivates effectiveness of vaccine. The patient wanted Pfizer to conduct clinical trials/have information on how antihistamines may interfere with the vaccine and asked if there is a blood test he can take after a period after the second vaccine dose to determine effectiveness of the vaccine. Concerned about his reaction as wondering if he should avoid the vaccine if a booster is indicated down the road and especially if his reaction is consider serious reactions and asked about the half-life. This consumer called to ask if Benadryl he has taken would affect the efficacy of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine that he has been administered. He has allergies so he took a Benadryl approximately 2 hours before being administered the vaccine around 11:00. After second dose was administered, he felt ok, he waited on site for about 30 minutes for monitoring like you are supposed to. About 2 hours after vaccine was administered his skin started feeling sunburned everywhere and skin started itching everywhere. In response to events he took another Benadryl. About 30 minutes after taking Benadryl the events went away. About 4-5 hours later the events came back the same way as when they started. He had some little raised bumps on his stomach like a little area of that that itched. His body itched all over but it felt horrible sunburned. He took another Benadryl and in about 30 minutes the events kind of cleared up, it was good. About 4 hours after that the Benadryl wore off, the events came back so he took another Benadryl. Today the events are ongoing but a lot milder than it was on 17Feb2021. It seemed like every 4-5 hours the events would come back but milder today. His question is since he had to take Benadryl or he would have been itching all over the place; and he did not want to go to emergency room which he probably would have had to if he had not taken the Benadryl; and he would like an answer, not a maybe; since he had to take Benadryl and taken Benadryl again today and got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot yesterday, is the Benadryl counteracting the efficacy of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He has had no other vaccines or immunizations other than the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He took Benadryl pill 2 hours before he went for the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine; had the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot, nothing happened until he would say maybe around 13:00; because he waited 30 minutes after the shot; got in the car and came home. Around 13:00 he started getting the itchiness but this time his skin felt like it was sunburned everywhere. He was not out in the sun, it is snowing there, there are clouds, no sun; skin all over felt like it was sunburned. On his stomach he had the little welts that started to itch; He took Benadryl. He did not want to use the Epi-Pen because the allergist said he had to call # if he used the Epi-Pen and he did not want to do that. Benadryl cleared it up; did not make it go away; about 4 hours later events started back; so he took Benadryl again; and about 4 hours later events came right back; it did that all night. Today, right now, he took a Benadryl let&#39;s say about 4-5 hours ago and events are not coming back like that. If events do not come back, he probably won&#39;t take another Benadryl. Events are a lot milder now, seems like they are going away. The Benadryl works. His concern is because he did hear on TV from one of those TV doctors on one of those daily regular daily talk shows that his idea was, and caller reported it is unknown how accurate the information is; but the doctor said avoid taking medications like Aspirin, Tylenol or antihistamines, all that stuff when you get your shot because it could affect the efficacy of the shot. Caller is not sure he is right; because his allergist just said take the Benadryl in case of anaphylactic shock which he did not have. Would like to know if this a waste of all this stuff he did because what they did now was he interfered with the action of the vaccine. No other vaccines were administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The adverse events required visit to Physician office and not required to visit Emergency room and was not hospitalized. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 78-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EL0261; NDC number, UPC number and expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 05Feb2021 (age at the time of vaccination was 78-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure and epilepsy both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had low level of sodium in his system because of phenobarbital. The patient&#39;s wife had metaplastic breast cancer and passed away 12 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included phenobarbital; phenytoin (DILANTIN [PHENYTOIN]); riboflavin (VITAMIN B 2); cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]); vitamin D3; vitamin C [ascorbic acid]; tocopherol (VITAMIN E [TOCOPHEROL]); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]); calcium; ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, folic acid, nicotinamide, panthenol, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (MULTIVITAMINS [ASCORBIC ACID;ERGOCALCIFEROL;FOLIC ACID;NICOTINAMIDE;PANTHENOL;RETINOL;RIBOFLAVIN;THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Previously, the patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK4176; NDC number and expiry date: not reported) on 15Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced dizziness, headache and chest discomfort. The patient received second dose and reported that the injection was given at an angle and then there was bulb (bump) on his arm for 4 months. In Jul2021, the patient had feeling of sensation in his arm, feeling of the thing red, felt hot and had inter massive itchiness. The patient reported that the redness, heat and itching were in the location of the injection (area was in the upper portion of his left arm, almost by his shoulder). At first, the patient didn&#39;t really give it much attention because it was just sort of like rash and then it started becoming little bit attended and becoming little bit like heat there, the patient had no fever at all during the whole period. He had only minor discomfort and itching. The patient asked if anyone had experienced the sides effects which the patient felt at the injection site (feeling hot and intermittent itchiness). The events were reported as non-serious. The patient found an article on  news entitled rare COVID arm phenomenon, a harmless immune response to vaccination, and the patient said that the article was talking about COVID arm, about where in 1st trial 344 people had the COVID arm but in the 2nd trial 64 people had COVID arm but this was the late body reaction that initially occur 10 to 14 days after the injection. The patient got 4 rounds of house treatment. The patient had been to safety and medical information. The patient had an article that he found online that covers all the symptoms that he had, that indicates that it was a delayed allergic reaction and that was the minor incidence and its extremely rare even on the global level. The patient reported that it occurred within the company Moderna, the other vaccine company like Pfizer that produced the 1st 2 vaccine. It was kind of same technology that they use, and the indication was that it will go away if an individual basically takes an aspirin or some anti-inflammatory for a few days. The patient was concerned about it because the way the owner of report said that the initial allergic reaction occurs with people within 10 to 14 days, the patient was 4 months after the effect and had symptoms. The patient explained the way he received injection. The patient reported that they may have given him the vaccine at an angle which created a small pocket through the medicine to stay into regional muscle and later it was released into his system and the patient experienced side effect, that was the minor side effect by description and he had an article that he can refer and even had a quotation medical journal of medicine, what they called a COVID arm phenomenon. The patient gave the reference of the website to other two ladies, where the rare phenomenon called the Covid arm was listed in detail. The patient further stated left upper right arm almost at the shoulder level. The patient did not receive any treatment medication. Investigations was not reported. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

                                                Rash is itching; rash under his arms from armpit to elbows underneath and on his sides below his belly button and in the groin area and on his buttocks; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 02Jan2021 00:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hard of hearing, surgery to remove the cancer, cancer broke his arm and he had a reverse shoulder replacement (medical conditions predating treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination); kidney failure that is better, muscle (disorder), blood pressure (abnormal), anxiety and radiation. The patient was previously given oxycodone, Ativan, and Xanax to take as needed after his surgery, but he has not taken them since Oct2020. Concomitant medication included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) for anxiety, amlodipine for blood pressure, metoprolol for blood pressure, tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX) from Sep2020 for kidney, carisoprodol (SOMA) from 22Oct2020 for muscle relaxant, ferrous sulfate, docusate sodium (STOOL SOFTENER), aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID]) all were ongoing and other unspecified products. The reporter stated that she and her husband got the vaccine on 02Jan2021 and the husband has developed a rash under his arm from his arm pit to elbow underneath, on his sides, below his belly button and in the groin area and on the buttocks. Rash was itching on 06Jan2021. She wanted to know could the COVID 19 vaccine cause this 4 days later. The patient noticed the itchy rash four days later on Wednesday afternoon 06Jan2021. He took Benadryl 25mg tablet by mouth that night before bed and then in the morning and put over the counter itch relief cream on it so in the night around 0200AM not too long after taking the Benadryl, the rash went away, pretty much gone. Today it seems to have come back and now it was worse because he has it on his buttocks. He didn&#39;t have it there at first. Mentioned that the patient also took a cool shower before going to bed. Wife mentioned that she just looked the rash right now and it was improved. Asking should he continue taking his relief or stop and let the doctor look at it? Advised caller to consult HCP. He is planning to get the next vaccine 23Jan2021. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The events did not require a visit to physician office and ER. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No relevant family medical history. No relevant tests done. Outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

A 79-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose in the arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. This patient reports receiving his first injection of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and experiencing some arm pain where the injection was given. Also he just noticed that when the nurse was going to give it to him that she had the syringe with the vaccine in it in her hand. She talked to him several minutes before administering. He thought this was supposed to be under 70 Degrees Fahrenheit. They were keeping it outside and giving the injection. He doesn&#39;t understand why they had it out in the weather. It was kind of warm in the state. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Sounds crazy, but the same thing happened to my sister and one of her friends.  Sometime later after arriving home, I developed chills.  At 10:30 pm I took two extra strength acetaminophen capsules (500 mg, ea.).  That eliminated both the chill and the right shoulder pain by 11:30.  Today, the 18th, I am feeling fine except for the injection site pain.

On about February 19, perhaps in the evening, noted varied perhaps 5 mm discolorations on ankles that in retrospect were probably resolved mild purpuric lesions.  On the same evening, noted very mild tenderness in the calf (soleus muscle) regions bilaterally feeling like mild muscle fatigue.  On February 21 at about 6 AM, before showering, noted bright cherry red lesions on/under skin of both ankles and more severely on the posterior calf of both lower legs above the calf tenderness.  The skin was flat and not tender.  Calf tenderness was slightly worse (though still mild).  Lesions turned purpuric, fading in hours.

                                                rash worsened; compromised immune system with the Multiple Myeloma/ getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; compromised immune system with the Multiple Myeloma/ getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse for her husband. A 79-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 26Jan2021 06:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included plasma cell myeloma from Oct2018, a compromised immune system with the Multiple Myeloma, rash from Dec2020 and ongoing. The patient had a diagnosis of multiple myeloma and had developed a slight rash on his left arm to lenalidomide (REVLIMID) before receiving the COVID vaccine, Benadryl was taken and after 3 days, it was gone.  It was only on his upper arms. She said a rash was a known side effect of the lenalidomide. The nurse giving his vaccine shot noticed his slight rash on his left arm. Concomitant medication included lenalidomide (REVLIMID) for 2.5 years for multiple myeloma in remission. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The past drug included bortezomib (VELCADE), the patient was administered a chemo agent (bortezomib) at the oncology center every 2 weeks and the oncology center held off giving his chemo shot 2 weeks before he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine on 26Jan2021. The reporter said her husband would not restart the chemo shot until he sees his oncologist again. She clarified her husband has now been off the bortezomib for a month, as of 01Feb2021. The patient experienced rash worsened on 28Jan2021. By 28Jan2021 the rash had spread to his trunk and by 29Jan2021 to his back. She clarified his rash was a dry rash, with no blisters or oozing. Her first thought was to get an ointment or a spray. He has now been given prednisone instead of a dose pack and the rash was gone/ the rash cleared up almost immediately and will stop lenalidomide for a couple weeks and continue the round of prednisone. The doctor could alter his therapy as needed. On 04Feb2021, the rash was gone but her husband&#39;s doctor wants him to finish his prescribed course of Prednisone. She clarified the Prednisone (manufacturer: Actavis) 40 mg was started on 01Feb2021, the rash started fading fast. By the next day (Tuesday, 02Feb2021) the rash was really fading, and now (04Feb2021) the rash was totally not there. The doctor told her husband to take one Benadryl, and to continue taking the Benadryl if his rash itches. She said her husband&#39;s latest blood work didn&#39;t indicate anything.  She said her husband&#39;s labs were always off, but were normal for having Multiple Myeloma. Both doctors want to keep her husband off of the lenalidomide. Reporter seriousness was reported as medically significant . The patient was treated for Multiple Myeloma for the past 2-1/2 years. He had been doing well, and his cancer doctors approved of him getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. The oncologist wanted her to call Pfizer to see if she can find anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine and how it pertains to the lenalidomide and her husband&#39;s Multiple Myeloma. She said her husband was almost 80 years old and very active. She said her husband had been in remission Multiple Myeloma for a year and his blood work was fine. By the time her husband starts taking lenalidomide again, he would be off of lenalidomide for almost 4 weeks. She said her husband&#39;s oncologist said he was going to cut back her husband&#39;s lenalidomide milligram dose and change his lenalidomide frequency to every other day when he resumes the lenalidomide. The reporter checked her husband&#39;s blood pressure (130/76) on 29Jan2021, after his rash worsened. She saidnot require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The rash event outcome  his pulse was fine, and she tested his blood sugar and it was fine. She said he had no temperature, clarifying his temperature was 97.6. The event did was recovering. The drug result was reported as unrelated. The reporter and her husband&#39;s doctors don&#39;t think his rash has anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient asked if Pfizer can point her in any direction with regard to her husband&#39;s situation. She said she read the COVID-19 Vaccine is a dead virus, but wants to know if her husband should be cautious in getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said her husband&#39;s doctors know that the rash was not precipitated by the COVID-19 Vaccine, but his rash did get worse after he got the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. His second dose was due 16Feb2021. The reporter was wondering if she should delay the second dose of the vaccine, the vaccine would make the rash worse.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently provided, the rash worsened after 2 days following the vaccine use thus a contributory role of BNT162B2 might not be fully excluded towards the event onset.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product and Rash faded soon under Prednisone.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

I had cataract surgery on my left eye on March 17 but I don&#39;t think that had any bearing on me getting shingles. I have heard that others have developed shingles after being vaccinated for covid-19.  That is only hear say and i have no direct information about that, So far my case of shingles is moderate.

This nurse reported similar events for two patients. This report refers to the husband.   An 80-year-old male patient received first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3246, expiry date: 30Apr2021, NDC number of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine: 59267- 1000-2), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 18:00 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included joint surgery which he just had one at the end of December of last year (2020) and had a procedure in Sep (unknown year); and prostate cancer which he had surgery February last year for this. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The nurse (patient&#39;s wife) reported that the patient received the Covid -19 Vaccine around 6 o&#39;clock on Wednesday evening. So basically 2 days ago and neither one of them seem to show any major reaction but yesterday sometime during the day, he started noticing a little bit of itching in his abdominal area and his back, no sign of whatsoever of a rash, there is no evidence of a rash at all but it is bothering him off and on today and she just didn&#39;t notice that was related in anyway. It&#39;s not in any of the paperwork we received and it&#39;s no rash and he is not having trouble breathing anything like that but he is having these periodic episodes of feeling itchy. When paraphrased the above concern, nurse stated, &#34;That&#39;s right, the back, basically yes and no other area right across the abdominal area and some occasionally little bit on his leg but more often on his back and it is not constant and there is no visible rash and he doesn&#39;t have a history of drug allergies. He is not one who generally reacts and he has no temperature, his vital signs are good. They just wanted to know if something we should be concerned about or whether there is been any report of this, she asked if they should call the doctor or what should they do. On 12Jan2021, the nurse called again and she stated that on 07Jan2021 (Thursday), the patient experienced random itching and continued in to Friday.  Furthermore, she stated that the day after he got the shot, and he is 80 with no history of drug reactions he had itching to his back, abdomen, some to the upper parts of his legs/thigh area and had a little bit to his head clarified to being his scalp. She says that she went to the drug store and got him some Benadryl. She says her the itching went away then on Thursday, and the next day he works part time, so he went to work on Friday and it started again. He was better on Saturday. She would like to know if this is a possible side effect, or if there might be a problem with him getting second dose. She said that the itching was in random places, it was the second night that she gave him the Benadryl that knocked him out, clarified he was sleepy after taking the Benadryl. She says she never saw a rash on his skin, and Saturday the itching was mitigated considerably. She said on Friday night she had got a little nervous, since the patient is 80 and has some health issues but no issues with medications in the past to their knowledge. He was better the next day. She says she doesn&#39;t know if his itching was associated with the vaccine. Also reported that the patient received one injection to his left arm and his arm was black and blue afterwards. The outcome of the event &#34;Periodic episodes of feeling itchy/itching to his back, abdomen, some to the upper parts of his legs/thigh area and had a little bit to his head clarified to being his scalp&#34; was recovered on 09Jan2021; for event &#34;her husband received one injection to his left arm and his arm was black and blue&#34; was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021028800 same reporter/drug, different event

                                                rash on the belly; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  An 80-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s boss) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK9231) in the Hospital (a family member that works there and the worker&#39;s were allowed to pick one of their family members to give the vaccine to) via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 at 11:30 AM at a single dose on the left upper arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medication included simvastatin (manufacturer unknown), dutasteride (manufacturer unknown) and montelukast (manufacturer unknown) all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The reporter stated that her boss received the first dose on 10Jan2021 and developed a rash on the belly. She wanted to know if he could take the second dose as scheduled or if he needs to wait. He was scheduled in 3 weeks. He has a rash all over his belly and the doctor said it was like a reaction to the vaccine. She does not know if he has to go the ER or what. His primary care physician (PCP) ordered him Benadryl pills and ointment. The reporter confirmed that the patient was ordered both oral and ointment. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

An 80-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL0142) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on an unspecified date (about three weeks ago) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. The reporter noted that both she and her husband took the Covid vaccine about 3 weeks ago, stated is time to take the second part. She read the pamphlet that came with it when we got the vaccine, said that a person could have a bad body rash. She stated her husband has had a bad body rash on an unspecified date. Noticed the rash right away, maybe the day or two after and it has persisted since, it was a nightmare for him, that she thought it was shingles on unspecified date.

                                                rash all over his body; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s spouse). An 80-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 intramuscular at the age of 80-years-old, administered in Arm Left on 17Feb2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN6201) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

After patient first gets out of the shower, his rash is more pronounced. She is not sure if it is because of the warm water or washing up that makes it more pronounced. She can run her hand over the rash and still feel it. The rash had gotten slightly better. Reporter stated that the rash has not concerned her until it has not gone away. Reporter is trying to decide whether or not to take patient to the doctors office since the rash has not went away. The outcome of the event rash was unknown. The event was considered as serious (medically significant).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of  subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded for the reported event of  rash, based on temporal relationship and the known product safety profile.

He went back to doctor and had been taking Atenolol for blood pressure. It has always been dose 50/25. His blood pressure was up just a bit and he cannot verify who this girl was that changed it to 100/25. He did not like the way he felt and eliminated it and went back to the previous dose. He had two over a period of 2-3 days. It is in a pharmacy vial.  He does not have a lot or expiration for the Atenolol 100/25.  The date his blood pressure was up was for the past couple of times.Usually, it is 120/60-70 and  then it jumped up to 150/60-70 and that is why it needed to be changed.  It was filled on 18Mar2021, which was after first vaccine but before second dose. Patient got deathly sick over the weekend on 02Apr2021. He had the shot on 20 Mar 2021, and it has been more than the two days you could have a reaction. He was deathly sick.

He never had a reaction before the one he got on 31Mar2021, and thought it may have been the virus shot. He said one other thing happened and is not sure if it had anything to do with it or not. He just started to feel worse and worse. Today is the first day he felt better. He is 80 and has not been this sick. It got really bad but today it is much better.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer or other non hcp (patient, self-reported). A 80-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8735, Expiration date 31 Jul 2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 22Apr2021 at 10:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included malignant melanoma from an unknown date in Dec 2019 (ongoing), illness from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included nivolumab (240 mg/m2) taken for malignant melanoma, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin b and experienced hypersensitivity. On 22Apr2021 patient got the 1st dose and on 25Apr2021, The patient experienced he broke out in a rash/he says the red dots are still there on his body with outcome of not recovered, itching with outcome of not recovered , his is a little blurry with outcome of unknown , rashes all over his stomach with outcome of unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included positron emission tomograms on 19 Jan 2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of he broke out in a rash/he says the red dots are still there on his body (rash), itching (pruritus). The CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has provided interim considerations for the use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (like the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine) during the Emergency Use Authorization.  These interim considerations state that antihistamines (like diphenhydramine) should not be taken prior to vaccination to prevent allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (anaphylaxis is a serious and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction). Follow-up on (26Apr2021): The patient took COVID 19 vaccine to protect his wife and himself for immunity against COVID 19. He said that is a fusion solution and he started taking this a month after the doctor cut the melanoma out of his head and it was cancerous, clarified as melanoma and he is on the last treatment. On the last PET scan, there was no melanoma on any place on his body. He says the PET scan was probably at least 2 months ago. He says he had a &#34;C scan&#34; last week but he hasn&#39;t gotten the results of that. He stated that took a couple Benadryl and it doesn&#39;t seem to be quite as bad as it was. He says the red dots are still there on his body. He confirms the rash has improved a little bit. He initially provides the Lot number ER3735. He has trouble reading his vaccination card, stating his is a little blurry. He gets his wife&#39;s card to compare as him and his wife received the vaccine at the same time. He explains his wife&#39;s card says ER8735, he believes the Lot number is probably the same on his card but the top part of the number 8 isn&#39;t connected and it made it look like an 8. He gets his magnifying glass out and confirms the Lot number is ER8735. He says that this is his first dose of the COVID-19, The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The outcome of the events rash and itching was recovered and the outcome event little blurry was unknown. No Follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected.

                                                shortness of breath; The shortness of breath has continued and has gotten a little worse; Nasal congestion; Coughing; heaviness in chest; It was like lumps; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer or other non hcp (patient himself). A 80-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 13Feb2021 12:10 (at the age of 80 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Previously the patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 80 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: 30Apr2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Heart bypass, it was 18 years ago. It was a aortic valve replacement, ongoing lymphoma cancer, and it is gone at this point, had shingles on the right side in 2015, skin cancer in both ears in 2016. Concomitant medications included ongoing warfarin sodium (COUMADIN), ongoing warfarin deanol, ongoing carvedilol, ongoing atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR ORIFARM), ongoing atorvastatin, ongoing hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene (TRIAMTERENE &amp; HCTZ), ongoing gabapentin (GABAPENTIN) taken for restless legs syndrome, ongoing acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), ongoing turmeric and bromelain, ongoing ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION) taken for macular hole, ongoing loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM) taken for diarrhoea, ongoing bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius (PROBIOTIC 10), ongoing potassium, ongoing Calcium citrate magnesium zinc all in one pill 80mg Magnesium, 500mg Calcium, 10mg Zinc, 20mg B6 taken for restless legs syndrome. Has been on his normal medications for years and nothing has changed. Has been on all of these medications at least 15 years, or more than that, maybe 18 years. The patient experienced shortness of breath since Feb2021 (at the age of 80 years and 6 monthes). He received both doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine and received his second dose 13Feb2021. He has been to his doctor and has been treated with antibiotics and Prednisone. He wanted to know what he should do about it. Caller&#39;s shortness of breath began a couple of weeks after his second dose in Mar2021, where it became noticeable, and it continues. The patient would like to know if others have reported shortness of breath after receiving the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. He has been experiencing shortness of breath since Feb2021. Maybe it is a side effect of the Covid vaccine, he does not know. First stated that it was around 15Feb2021 or earlier, when he first went to the doctor. He stated that he did start experiencing it before then. He wouldn&#39;t of went to the doctor if he didn&#39;t have that. Wife was brought on the phone to describe the event further. Stated that 01Mar2021 is when he first went to the doctor. They went on vacation on an unspecified date in Mar2021 and his wife had to take him to a clinic there that it was around 09Mar2021. He has had 4 series of antibiotics and prednisone since that first visit in Mar2021. When he got home, he went to the doctor again and they gave him more antibiotics and Prednisone. Then again in May, he had another round of it, and is still experiencing shortness of breath. He had also had other symptoms at that time. He had a lot of congestion. It did not stop but that has kind of subsided. The shortness of breath has remained. He had heard a news report stating shortness of breath symptoms have been reported regarding the COVID vaccine. He had his last shot 13Feb2021, he thinks it was. Soon after, he started having the shortness of breath. At first, he didn&#39;t relate it to the Covid shot. He does have heart problems. The first antibiotic was Azithromycin, it was with the Prednisone, It was the ZPack. He took it for 6 days and then tapered one every day. In Mar 2021 he took Medrol pack, which was 4mg tablets. They were different Prednisones and different antibiotics each time. The last one he took was Doxycycline, which was 40mg and he took it for 4 days. Can&#39;t remember what the other one was. Caller states that he had the Zpack from the clinic and his doctor gave him Doxycycline after he came home. It was a different amount of Prednisone each time. He had a lot of allergy like symptoms with nasal congestion and coughing. States that it was clear congestion and was probably 3 times as thick as with normal nasal problems. It was like lumps, was clear and was coughing it up. The congestion started when he was coughing up stuff. The last time his doctor gave him nasal spray, Azelastine HCI, which was in a spray bottle with 30ml. He stopped it after a period of time. He still has some congestion every day, but it is not near what it was before. The Prednisone and antibiotic lessened the problem along with the nasal spray and really helped. The shortness of breath has continued and has gotten a little worse. He used to be able to walk 3 quarters of a mile every day but now he probably can&#39;t walk 4 blocks. Sometimes, just sitting on the couch, watching TV, he gets heaviness in his chest. He has to breathe really deep to get it fixed. When he had his oxygen level tested, at the doctor&#39;s office, it is always 98, 99 or 100 percent. The doctor listens to his lungs and he doesn&#39;t see or hear anything that is going on. He had an X-ray for his lungs they didn&#39;t see anything there either. Had a chest X-ray, blood tests by his primary care physician and heart doctor. Had blood tests by his oncology doctor. All of those came out normal, with no problems. Feel free to ask for those results. No other additional vaccines were administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient has not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior vaccinations. The adverse event shortness of breath resulted in visit to urgent care and physician office. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the adverse events. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, a possible causal association between the events &#34;Dyspnoea, Nasal congestion ,Cough, Chest discomfort &#34; and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in re-sponse, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Nothing on the neck, face or head; very little on the back but heavy on the front torso.  (I have pictures). Not painful or itching. Took Benedryl for 2 days, no change. Dr. prescribed Fluocinonide Cream .05% on Feb 4. Have applied one dose and will continue doing that. Urgent care suggested that the site location personnel need to be contacted.  He is scheduled for Feb 11 to get injection #2.  Should he or not?

A 81 years old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247 or EL3427), via an unspecified route of administration at Arm Left on 21Jan2021 09:33 at the 81 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   The medical history was none. The family medical history was none. The concomitant medications included warfarin from Mar2012 for Atrial fibrillation( AFib) and standard medications . The patient was not feeling well. All occurred on 21Jan2021 18:00, the patient developed symptoms, such as aches all over his body, aches all over with muscles pains with muscle pains, headache, joint pain, chills, injection site pain on left arm, body slightly warm, felt slightly warm, feeling unwell. He had chills all night and could not get warm. The reporter had not taken the patient&#39;s temperature yet. The patient takes regular medications. The patient was on warfarin and standard medications. The reporter stated the vaccine cards were mixed up because they did not write their names on them and the vaccine lot numbers looks like they were mixed up. Someone probably made a mistake because one says EL3247 and the other says EL3427, so she is not sure which it is. The handwriting is different on the cards. There was no Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was not Emergency Room Visit or physician&#39;s office required Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event was not recovered.

Was probably the lymph node.; coughs; very mild sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 81-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm at the age of 81-year-old on 27Mar2021 (Lot Number: EP6955) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cancer from 2018 (started out with BCG treatments, where they insert bacteria into the bladder); Had another form of immunotherapy that didn&#39;t work too well for him and the cancer kept growing chemotherapy; Had a couple of operations and surgeries where the doctor removed it all but it came back. Best reaction was chemotherapy (It stopped the bleeding and was working on the cancer). Last one was 15Feb2021. Was getting blood work for every treatment. Had to miss one of the treatments due to low platelets. Has a chest port for treatments and blood work.  Was very conscious before having chemo. It is kind of a rough thing to kill cancer but also kills good cells too. Definitely worked on killing the cancer for a while; the last treatment was 15Feb2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo. Had bladder cancer (which got out of the bladder and started spreading in to the lymph system), Height: used to be 5&#39;7&#34;, is now maybe 5&#34;4&#34;. The caller remarks that when he started with chemotherapy. he also lost a lot of weight.  Weight: When he went in for last appointment it was 129 or 130 pounds. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took chemotherapy nos from unknown date to 15Feb2021 for cancer. The patient experienced pain in neck and back on 28Mar2021, pain in chest on 29Mar2021. Caller stating that he and his wife had shot number one 27Mar2021 and are scheduled for second shot 20Apr2021. Wife had no symptoms, maybe a bit of a sore arm and he had the same reaction. Was a very mild sore arm in 2021. On day 2 or 3 on the right side of the neck, had felt a little nagging in Mar2021 and slight pain, especially when he moved and felt it around his back. It is just starting to go away now at 3 weeks. Around the back, around the perimeter and when he coughs in Mar2021, he can feel it in his chest. He is scheduled for the second shot. Is wondering if the second shot will have those symptoms. It&#39;s not like it is anything severe, it is just nagging. What worries is him, is that it lasted this long. Is a cancer patient and had last chemotherapy 15Feb2021. His oncologist said to go ahead and take the shot because he really needs the protection. It was asked what if he has the same reaction again. Will go on website but wanted to find out what other people are experiencing and whether or not to take the second shot. Wants to take it for protection. Really wants to take the shot on Tuesday. Pain in neck and back: Only when he coughs, is more of an ache. Started day 2 after vaccine on 28Mar2021. Was like a very dull irritation in the right side of the neck in Mar2021. Was probably the lymph node in Mar2021.  Pain in chest: When he sneezes in Mar2021, there is a sharp pain, all around the perimeter of his chest. Is gone as soon as he stops coughing. Feels when muscles are contracting in Mar2021. Started day 3 after getting the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo. Had bladder cancer, which got out of the bladder and started spreading in to the lymph system. Wants to be put on immunotherapy but can&#39;t until he is finished with his shots. If he gets the immunotherapy and if he has a reaction, would have to use steroids and they do not want to do that with the vaccine. The doctor wanted to start him earlier on the immunotherapy but thought it was important to get the vaccine first, that taken care of.  The pain is only sharp if he lifts something. Otherwise, it is just dull. He knows it is there. It is not completely gone. This morning was the best that he had. Really got good sleep last night. The best since it has happened. When he sneezes, he can kind of feel it around his chest, just around the perimeter of the muscles. Treatment: The first couple of days, just put up with it. Took Tylenol one day and then on another day. Takes at bedtime. Does not like taking Tylenol because it effects his liver. If he doesn&#39;t need it, he doesn&#39;t take it. In the last week, every night he has been less and less bothered by how he slept. Last night he didn&#39;t even know he had it, the pain, and slept really well. Have not taken any meds, just Tylenol on day 4 and 5 to help sleep. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of events very mild sore arm, sneezes and feels when muscles are contracting was unknown. The outcome of other events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

An 82-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient also started to receive mirtazapine (MIRTAZAPINE, 50 mg, Capsule, soft), via an unspecified route of administration, from an unspecified date at 50 mg, once a day for sleep. Medical history included sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], calcium, escitalopram, finasteride, lamotrigine, simvastatin, tamsulosin. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported receiving the Pfizer vaccine in his right arm on 06Feb2021. That evening he took his nightly medication and went to bed at 11:30 pm. He stated he wasn&#39;t able to sleep because he felt like he was in a refrigerator and he was shaking. He had lower back pain, right arm/shoulder pain, and went to the bathroom 5 times (all on an unspecified date in Feb2021), which was not normal for him. The patient added that it was the second dosage of the Pfizer (Covid-19 Vaccine) her received on 06Feb2021. And he had some negative response: a little pain in his shoulder but the worst thing that happened, he went to bed 11:30 did not sleep at all. At 11:30 night, he took his medication (Mirtazapine) and went to bed. He was shaking and he had to put another blanket on himself. Eventually, it was okay, but the problem is he was not able to sleep all night, from 11:30 to 9&#39; O clock this morning (07Feb2021). Consumer stated, &#34;Yesterday my wife and I had the second dose of the Pfizer and I had really strange reaction and I will tell you what it was. Last night at about 11:30 I took my night medicine (later clarified as Mirtazapine), I went to bedroom, I started shaking all over. And the worst part is from 11:30 to 10 o&#39; clock this morning, I was not able to sleep. There is slight pain in my shoulder&#34;. When confirmed if the consumer wanted to report the same or have any questions, consumer stated, &#34;No, we have no problem with temperature is fine, the oxygen is fine. Just I don&#39;t understand why in fact the medication (mirtazapine) is to induce sleeping, use to for sleep within half hour but it didn&#39;t help. I wanted to know what happened. So, this will eventually go away?&#34; The action taken in response to the events for mirtazapine was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on batch number has been requested.

An 82-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot no. and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (at the age of 82-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cancer, stage 4 renal cancer with metastasis to the lung, kidney failure and being dialyzed, electrolyte imbalance, prostate infection, blood pressure abnormal. Concomitant medications included prednisone for kidney failure; sevelamer carbonate (RENVELA) to regulates his electrolytes; hydralazine (HYDRALAZINE) for blood pressure; candesartan for blood pressure; metoprolol succinate (TOPROL) for blood pressure; finasteride for prostate; and amlodipine. The patient developed a very dark red, big, angry rash on the back of both of his hands that is moving up his arms (reported as worsened), which the consumer describes as &#34;erythema multiforme&#34;.  Looks like erythema multiform is this rash associated with the product very dark red, big angry splotches very large. He was told he should get the vaccination, his oncologist and his nephrologist said he should get it so he got the vaccination last Tuesday and then he woke up either the next day or the day after that and her mother said he had a very severe rash on his hands and now it is climbing up his arms. It almost looks like erythema multiforme but it has no bulls eye, It is dark red and ugly looking it is rough, it is not really raised. They went to the oncologist and they took blood work to make sure his platelets were okay and they were normal so his doctors are baffled with this. She is calling from her husband&#39;s surgery office and they are disgusted with the healthcare he is receiving there but she wants to know if there is any data with cancer patients taking the vaccine or with people that have developed a rash like she is describing. His weight has dropped a lot since she last saw him he is 5&#39;10&#34;, now he is probably about 150 or 160 lbs. That is an estimate. He developed the rash either 24Feb2021 or 25Feb2021, she is not sure which. It was ongoing and it is actually spreading up his arms so she would say it is worsened. He is on a slew of medications, but she doesn&#39;t know if they want all of them. It could be an interaction with medication, he is a really sick person. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.

When he went to urgent care, he was treated with 2 injections Benadryl and steroid (Lot or expiration date was unknown). He was also treated with Pepcid. The injections did not help his symptoms. In the urgent care they didn&#39;t knew what the rash was and later clarified that they called it dermatitis. He stated that the staff did not thought that it was not related to the vaccine. He reclarified that when he was at urgent care, the staff told him that he should feel better in the evening, but by midnight, he decided to go to the emergency room. In the emergency room, he was given Tagamet, Hydroxyzine, and Prednisone. The rash went away and reported that itching was present, but not as bad as it was before. He reported that he took Hydroxyzine as prescribed, and after about 20 minutes, his itching diminishes but then in the evening he started to itch again. Later in the report it was mentioned that for some days he only has to take it once a day and sometimes he can skip a day when he was not itching. He was treated and released from the emergency room. The patient went to dermatologist and neurologist and no one could tell him why he had itching, no one had come up with a treatment as he was still itching. The patient stated that he called because he was reading information about the side effects and learned that the vaccine may cause a rash. Relevant tests were reported as none. Device date was reported as 22Jun2021. The outcome of the rash was recovered completely in 2021, for scratch and pruritus was not resolved and for stroke and dermatitis was unknown.

This morning, he got up at 6am and his temperature was around 98.8; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9261; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 26Jan2021 at 8:30 to 9 AM, at a single dose, for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history in Mar2020 included had a temperature for 7 days. He tested positive for COVID and it took a while to test negative. At the end of Mar2020 until the first of Apr2020, his temperature was 97 something. He has checked his temperature every day since then. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. He did not receive additional vaccines on the same date bnt162b2 was given. The patient had his first COVID-19 shot yesterday morning about 8:30 or 9:00. He hadn&#39;t really looked at the list of side effects, but yesterday afternoon (26Jan2021), he had slight pain in the arm where the shot was given. If he moved his arm, he would have slight discomfort. The pain was mostly gone today. He also had some slight tenderness in his shoulder, but it&#39;s certainly less than what it was yesterday. He saw other things that were listed including fever. He wanted to know if Pfizer had any information as what to amount of fever people typically experience after having the shot.  Yesterday (unspecified date in Jan2021), his temperature was 97 something. This morning, he got up at 6 am and his temperature was around 98.8. And then he had to take his wife to therapy and when he got back 3 hours later, he took it now and his temperature was 99 degrees. He was just wondering if Pfizer had an idea of how much fever is normal from the shot?  He hasn&#39;t had any other reactions. The events did not require Emergency Room or Physician&#39;s Office visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 97 something on 26Jan2021, 98.8 and 99 on 27Jan2021; sars-cov-2 test: positive on an unspecified date in 2020 and negative on an unspecified date in 2020. Outcome of the event &#34;slight pain in his arm the shot was given&#34; was recovering, while for the other events was unknown.

On Saturday morning, however, following second dose, experienced moderate dizziness upon rising--had to hold on to furniture to maintain balance.  Dizziness gradually subsided and was completely gone after 20-25 minutes.  Additional note: several years ago experienced one episode of extreme benign postural vertigo, but experience after second dose of vaccine was milder and shorter in duration.

Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. Patient stated that he got the Pfizer COVID 19 Vaccine yesterday (25Feb2021) at noon and this morning (26Feb2021), he has a rash on the inside of his thigh. He clarifies well it is not a rash it is more like a hematoma, almost like discoloration of the skin, it doesn&#39;t hurt but he wants to see if this is something that normally occurs. He showered last night and didn&#39;t notice it until this morning. He only noticed it about a half hour ago so he is not sure if there is any difference. He clarifies the area on the inside of his thigh is a purplish color, like a bluish reddish but it is not red. It looks like a hematoma, like bleeding under the skin. There is no swelling, it is not raised and it doesn&#39;t hurt to touch, just there. He didn&#39;t call his primary about this. He got this information so his doctor does not know anything about it. If it is something to be concerned about he will run down to the emergency room but he will see if he can find the office contact info. Outcome of the events was not recovered. Case was reported as non-serious.

An 83-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 13Jan2021 (received at the age of 83-years-old) at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pacemaker and atrial fibrillation. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had his first Pfizer vaccine shot on 13Jan2021 and was scheduled for the second on Wednesday, 03Feb2021.  Six or seven days after getting the first dose, in Jan2021, he noticed little red spots. He came down with shingles and his doctor has prescribed him valcyclovir.  It&#39;s an antiviral medication and he just want to be sure he&#39;ll still be able to get the second dose of the vaccine. His physician gave him a miracle medicine for it, Valacyclovir, an antiviral medication, he gathers, and it has done a great job. He has taken it for 3-4 days; the shingles are now leaving. However, he has his next shot, his second shot of the vaccine is this coming Wednesday, and he wondered if anyone at Pfizer can say whether this antiviral for shingles, a pill, is in any way perhaps going to interfere with the COVID second shot. He further stated, &#34;I tell you, that first shot went in like a hot knife through butter!&#34; Outcome of the event was recovering.

A 83-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Jan2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 83-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation at Hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included lovastatin 10mg, and Amigo stone hcl 200mg. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 29Jan2021, the patient experienced blister under true breast leaking fluid hurting. Patient noticed blister on lower right abdomen, did not bother and went to bed, and later it popped out. Patient started itching and might have scratched it. Patient never had this before, until after the COVID-19 shot. It was a three-quarter inch line. When the blister popped it leaked over on the skin and another blister appeared, and stated there were about 5 blisters. It was real sore. Patient used Calamine lotion on it and it was great after that. Calamine lotion dried it fast, stopped itching and got good relief. Patient enquired what else he needs to do. The clinical outcome of the events was recovering.  Follow-up (29Jan2021): This follow-up is being submitted to notify that new event Started itching and might have scratched it&#39; added, updated onset date of all events.

One dermatologist suggested it was eczema and gave me a cream.  After a couple more weeks the rash was evolving from 1/8 &#34; itchy spots to 1/2 &#34; scaly itchy spots.  A second dermatologist prescribed a steroid.  It&#39;s worse now and nothing has helped!

A 84-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. After vaccination, the patient park the car and all of a sudden he started to get like pins and needles they used to call in old days in his feet, in his toes. Last time he had this something like this years ago, he sat in the car too long. So, he loosen up his snickers and all and sat there, everything else was all right, a lady came over 15 minutes later and she said okay they can go. So the patient said he got some pins and needles in his feet, before he said the lady said &#34;huh, are you having trouble breathing or anything&#34;, the patient said no he felt fine. So let they go home, and then the patient went home it&#39;s at night when he was laying down he didn&#39;t get much reaction and all. So he went up to the doctor she looked at up a few things and opened few things and the patient didn&#39;t think the doctor really had an answer for it. It was scheduled to go Monday again for the second it was still there. The patient didn&#39;t know it was probably kind of nerve reaction and all and his wife said it could be psoriasis, he never had this, it was not aggravating it&#39;s only when he walked he forgot he even had it . It&#39;s just uncomfortable and the bottom of his feet. He never had any reaction to any shot whether it was shingles or pneumonia, flu shots or whatever. The outcome of events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar events for 2 patients (Himself and wife) this report is for 1st of 2 patient. A 84-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: E18982, Expiration date: UNKNOWN) in left arm on 06Feb2021 at 08:40 as a single dose for covid-19 immunization.

The reported said that their vaccine cards are handwritten and they got the same LOT, he provides unknown number PF1202, which he thinks means Pfizer with an ID number they may have given him and he says NDC/EXP were not provided on their handwritten vaccine cards. The patient was not given treatment for AE slight pain and it went away, also the slight redness went away, there was a little bump. The reporter said it was not bad, it was good that their side effects were small and not massive at all, and it was a little thing but they are concerned if their reaction could be considered unusual, like some people, or if should it could be a stronger dosage. He says at the time their vaccines were done in cars, so he has no knowledge of temperature or amount of dosage, and says that after they get their second dose on the 17th. The outcome of the event slight redness to injection site was recovered on Mar2021 and other outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                He believes the trouble started in the wake of his CoViD-19 immunizations (Moderna #1was given on 2/12/2021 and #2 was given on 3/12).  Both shots were given into the left arm.  He reports some soreness at the injection site on the left arm after both shots, but this soreness has persisted with some stiffness and difficulty abducting the arm beyond 90 degrees.  Two weeks after the first shot, his right shoulder started hurting also, worst distal to the glenohumeral fossa without radiation, also aggravated with abduction beyond 90 degrees.  Some soft tissue swelling was noted around the hand.   Simvastatin was discontinued with no improvement in symptoms.  Labs showed a sed rate of 54 mm/hr and C-reactive protein of 46 mg/L.  Blood cultures were drawn which were negative, suggesting no evidence of osteomyelitis flare.  He was started on prednisone 15 mg PO daily on 4/5/2021 with rapid and dramatic improvement in symptoms.  Presumptive diagnosis is polymyalgia rheumatica, but he had no previous history of same, and onset of symptoms was remarkably close to the immunizations.

A 84-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13Feb2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, occasionally rapid heart beat, blood cholesterol abnormal, cardiac operation (9 years ago, macular degeneration (in each eye and puts eyedrops in and occasionally they give him injections). Concomitant medication(s) included atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]; 10mg everyday) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; estradiol (ESTROGEN; 10mg everyday). The patient did not have any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient reported practically had no symptoms with either shot. After his first dose he had one day where his blood pressure went very low but by the time he talked to his cardiologist it had gone back to normal and was taking pills, it was under control. Yesterday afternoon he experienced pain in his left wrist, which was the same arm that he received his injection, and describes the pain as not too bad. He states that when he uses his wrist in certain positions, the pain &#34;shoots up.&#34; This morning on the lower part of his left arm (&#34;not the top where I got the injection&#34;) he has &#34;slight pain.&#34; He says this morning his upper arm on the underside where he got it on the left side is swollen. He says he would like to know can it be from vaccine, though maybe he could have strained his wrist, it happened yesterday evening, he had wrist pain and swollen under side of his arm where he got the vaccine injected. He says yesterday late afternoon was the first time, it could be something else, it was the same arm this morning he has a little pain to his upper arm that was not on injection side but below, under it. The patient did not received any treatment, it was not serious pain, it was low level pain, when he uses his wrist and turns it, it comes in more prominent. He says it was not pain that bothers him, if it was not related to the vaccine then he most likely strained his arm.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Itching; Aches and pains; Pins and needles; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (reporting for herself).  A 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH mRNA COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 25Feb2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation  (85-year age at Vaccination). The patient medical history was none. The patient had no previous allergies. Patient states he has a pacemaker and has a stent in his heart. Both have been there for over 10 years. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications include carvedilol (COREG) at 25 mg, twice a day taken for cardiac disorder (He has been taking this for years). It was reported that patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EM9809, Expiry date: 30Jun2021) 04Feb2021 11:00. It was reported that during that night he was getting aches and pains, he took Tylenol and was fine for a while week. The week after that, he started to get pins and needles all over his body, and itching. He states it did not want to go away. Sometimes it was better, sometimes it was worse. The doctor gave him antihistamines, but it did not go away. All the doctor&#39;s say they have never heard of it, no one knows what it was. He read some place that they have few cases like this. He was just trying to find out what he should do. He was itching all the time and got pins and needles. The antihistamine helps, but it comes back. It has been over a month now, almost 2 months. He asks what he should do. He had seen a cardiologist, urologist, and his regular doctor. In the beginning he had itchiness and pins and needles all the time, but now it was on and off. For example right now he did not have it but when he woke up this morning it was there. He tried different soaps and different shampoos, just in case that was it. He even took off some of the medications for a couple days to be sure it was one of them but no. He was almost 100% sure it was it, he never had this before. Started the night of the shot. It got a little better in the night. The next morning he took Tylenol and felt better and thought it was all over. It was then explained that it started again about a week or so later and now he has it all the time. Itchiness began a week or a week or a half. Then says it could have been 2 weeks later. The symptoms are on and off. For the aches and pains he took Tylenol and it went away. The doctor that prescribed Coreg said he never had anyone having trouble taking this medication with the vaccine. He never heard of that. That was the first thing he asked. Outcome of the event Aches and pains was recovered on 26Feb2021. Outcome of the other events was not recovered.     No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected

When he moved around the muscle discomfort was relieved, but would come back when he was not moving his joints.    Around 10 AM, he sat in a hot tub about 45 minutes, then applied body lotion and was relieved.  Neither the itch or muscle aches returned.

                                                covid shot estimated at Feb 1st between 1-2 PM, first shot, and then had a trip and fall that day. 3-5 days later noted cellulitis on his leg with redness, swelling, pain, edema and went to urgent care on the 10th, given some antibiotics which he is currently taking and the site is looking much better. Patient notes also painless nodules going down his bicep, but not where lymph nodes are (more in the middle of the arm from the site, not near elbow or armpit). Pt also noted some bruising initially at the injection site which is better. Should he still get his second shot even with the abx and cellulitis?  Adv cellulitis on the leg more related to the fall than the shot. The nodules could be from the shot but as they aren&#39;t where I would typically expect to see lymphadenopathy would rec FU with PCP if the nodules persist or worsen. None of this is a contraindication to getting the second dose of the vaccine, but inform the vaccine providers that you are on elliquis so they can be aware to watch for additional bruising/bleeding, which is common after the shot. Discussed also Q518.

This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: 2021125505) on 05-Feb-2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 08-Feb-2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of SMALL INTESTINAL HAEMORRHAGE (bleeding internally in small intestine) in 86-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) tablet for an unknown indication. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included Covid-19 Vaccine for Prevention. Product or product use issues identified: WRONG TECHNIQUE IN PRODUCT USAGE PROCESS (cut Eliquis in half). Concurrent medical conditions included Gout (diagnosed two or three years ago). On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (Oral) 2.5mg half tablet by mouth twice daily. On 07-Jan-2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (Intramuscular) intramuscular injection in right arm. Further treatment periods at the same dose started on 01-Feb-2021. In January 2021, the patient experienced RASH (rash on shoulder and neck). On an unknown date, the patient experienced SMALL INTESTINAL HAEMORRHAGE (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was treated with salicylic acid (Eucerin [Salicylic Acid]) for Rash. The action taken with Eliquis(Oral) was unknown. At the time of the report, SMALL INTESTINAL HAEMORRHAGE outcome was unknown and RASH did not resolve. Cardiologist recommended patient to take apixaban for palpitation of the heart that he has every so often. Eliquis at 2.5mg tablet twice a day and then patient found out he was bleeding to death, clarifies he was bleeding internally in his small intestine. So he cut his Eliquis in half and he was currently taking half of 2.5mg tablet twice a day. He got the Pfizer covidl19 shot. He has developed a rash on his shoulder and neck. He also stopped using his laundry soap since he was not sure if it was his laundry soap. For Eliquis(Oral), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.; Sender&#39;s Comments: BMS Medical Evaluation Comment: This patient had small intestine hemorrhage while on apixaban. Based on the anticoagulant nature of apixaban, its contributory role in small intestine hemorrhage is considered possible.

                                                First of all, the second dose may be FM - it was cut too close for me to tell.  His problem was severe itching across the back and down the back to below his waist.  Itching on shoulders and down below the underarm, some on legs/arms.  It started around the time of the vaccine and was starting to get better, then he got the second shot on Feb 10 and he&#39;s still itching today but not as bad.  He did see his heart doctor after the first shot and the nurse also had some itching.  We also went to see a dermatologist and he couldn&#39;t figure out what the cause was.  His back/shoulders/arms/legs had red splotches all over where the itching was.  Not exactly a rash but small up to medium sized - about the size of one&#39;s fingernail, and raised a little bit.  All this was why he went at least a month only taking his necessary heart medications and then he went back on the regular stuff but the itching is still there, although not as irritating now as before.

                                                Patient called our clinic to report swelling and redness of the left hand.  He said this symptom started several days after receiving the vaccine at an outside location.  Symptoms gradually worsened over the last few days until his hand became so swollen that it became difficult to make a fist and is impairing his activities of daily living.  Reaction seems to be localized to the hand and patient reports no other symptoms.

An 87-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiration date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration into the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (COVID prevention). The patient&#39;s medical history included Alzheimer&#39;s disease and stroke. There were no concomitant medications. The reporter was calling regarding his father who was an 87-year-old combat veteran. The reporter stated that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 12Jan2021. The patient was scheduled for his second dose on 02Feb2021, but they had to cancel that appointment because the patient was in the hospital from a fall he had on 29Jan2021 where he bruised his hip and bruised his rib. The patient was hospitalized from 30Jan2021 and was released from the hospital on 05Feb2021. The reporter stated that the clinic said they are not able to make any more appointments right now. The reporter was wondering if there were consequences of, or a danger in, getting the second dose outside of the recommended timeframe. The patient is now on a waiting list to get the second dose and he would like to know how far past the recommended 21 days can he go and still have the vaccine be effective. The patient received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient has had an MRI before where it was indicated that there were some spots from a past stroke. The reporter stated that no paralysis has been identified. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Some of the purpura was on the left arm and he had a few spots on the upper chest. Had no fever, no malaise, just what the patient described as blistering and so they had a dermatologist look at it. All seems to be improving. They were curious as to what this is. The patient feels fine and is ambulatory and the purpura does not itch. Caller does not provide seriousness criteria when queried. Initially it was thought, because the patient was on Eliquis for heart failure and atrial fib, that the Eliquis was related to events, but when the Dermatologist looked at it and stated it maybe excavation they decided to call and find out what Pfizer wanted them to do. Caller states he can give a list of medications if needed. Says patient had a comprehensive biochemical profile done non fasting also on 18Jan2021. Patient was seen by him initially on 19Jan2021. Wants to know whether this is a safety concern or/and if the patient should have the second dose. event requires a visit to physician office.

                                                he is coughing now; soreness in muscle on site on injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 88-year-old male patient (husband) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL9261, expiry date: May2021), intramuscular on 23Jan2021 11:30 AM at 0.3 mL, single on left deltoid (reported as &#34;0.3ml by IM (intramuscular) injection once to in left shoulder, the usual place&#34;) for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as &#34;88 and they are not anxious for him to get COVID/he has deep lung disease and if he didn&#39;t get it, he may die from it&#34;).  Vaccination facility type was a special clinic set up by hospital. Vaccine was not administered at facility. Medical history included deep lung disease, total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, asthmatic, lung problems. Patient has no compromised immune system. Patient&#39;s only allergic reaction was old tetanus (tetanus toxoid) but he was really fine. Patient had tetanus toxoid in 1950, he was a very young man and he has not had it since then, the reporter does not believe they give it anymore. No family medical history relevant to adverse events, also reported as &#34;No, but there is no history for the COVID vaccine, we are only 3 months into it&#34;. Concomitant medication included omalizumab (XOLAIR) for lung problems and asthmatic. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer product. After the first 3 days, patient got the vaccine on 23Jan2021. Patient is now on day 9 but the first 3 days after, he had no side effects. On the 4th day (27Jan2021), he developed soreness in his muscle on the site of injection, and the next day it was increasingly sore, on the 28Jan2021, 29Jan2021, 30Jan2021, and was quite incapacitated, he could not use it, it was really bad, now he was beginning to improve. The reporter wanted to Pfizer to know the length and depth. It only had to do with the use of the muscle not, he was not suffering when not using the arm, a couple days were really bad, he did feel it when he was not using it, but most of the time, the pain came when he needed to use it. The reporter talked to enough who said don&#39;t worry, but patient had a total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, in that arm and asked &#34;could that injection exacerbate anything going on there?  Most doctors said to not worry about it&#34;. The reporter wants to help COVID. The reporter got hers minute after his husband and she had no side effects whatsoever, so if there was any question about something going on at the site, she could not imagine hers would be so perfect. The event did not require emergency room and physician office visit, further reported that patient had multiple health issues. Patient was coughing now(01Feb2021), over the years, reporter has learned to deal with many things without going to Urgent Care, ER, patient was 88 and the reporter wanted to keep his husband out due to COVID. The reporter called friends who were medical doctors (MDs), as the reporter was worried, the patient was coming out of it. Patient has one injection, a new medication he was on a biologic. Patient was first refused to get the COVID vaccine due to biologic, and the day before he had received it, so they discussed and decided because of biologic, &#34;XOLAIR&#34;. There were no adverse events prior vaccinations. Patient went on Friday for his next Xolair, he had no problems then. There were no relevant tests and was reported that patient has been there the whole time, at home, has been under quarantine since last Mar2020. If anything threw up a red flag, reporter would think it would be something they would explore, maybe for the Xolair, when this question came up, it was several days before the vaccine, patient was refused. Patient was asked if there were other injections, reporter said that his husband would have &#34;one the one day before&#34;, and they canceled his appointment, and he went to the doctor, the pulmonologist, who administered Xolair, and reporter said that his husband was refused, the doctor said no, &#34;it&#39;s a biologic, he was giving it to patients having the COVID vaccine, there were no interactions, and reinstated approval and everything was a go&#34;. Outcome of the event &#34;soreness in muscle on site on injection&#34; was recovering while for coughing was unknown.

The patient developed on day four (unknown date in 2021) redness with purplish lesions to the upper arm almost to antecubital. He was put on Levaquin by primary physician, the evaluation in his case was a cellulitis (unknown date in 2021). The reporter asked if the patient should get the second dose. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported cellulitis cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history included Alzheimer&#39;s and other conditions, but family did not disclose. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications. The patient previously took piroxicam (FELDENE) and experienced allergies. The vaccine was administered in a public health clinic or Veterans administration facility. On 25Feb2021, the patient noticed pain in face in the evening of day he was vaccinated and then the patient developed swelling by the next morning (26Feb2021). On 27Feb2021, the patient&#39;s face was so swollen that his face was weeping serous fluid and family took him to the ER. The swollen cheeks bilaterally progressed to cellulitis (27Feb2021) requiring oral steroids, famotidine (PEPCID), and antibiotics including cefalexin (CEPHALEXIN). The patient remains on steroids and creams to treat swelling and sores. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office or clinic visit and emergency room or department or urgent care. The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine can not be excluded for the reported event of cellulitis due to temporal relationship.

An 89-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3249, expiry date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration (injection) in the left arm on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 89-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was on unspecified concomitant medications. The patient stated he has been taking the same medications for several years, and he has had no problems with those. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day. The patient had his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 22Jan2021. He was due for his second shot on 12Feb2021. After he had the first shot, his body got itchy all over and it was still itchy. He also had little tiny pimples on his skin, and it was very uncomfortable. He was wondering if this was a known reaction to the product. He had no idea what to do to relieve the itching. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021, and the itching started either the next day or two days after getting the vaccine. His body became very itchy, and he was itchy all over. He was developing little red like pimples all different parts of his body; itchy bumps. The itching and pimples having continued through to now, and it seemed to get even more itchy in the evening at bedtime. Last night (unspecified date), he had it on the top of his feet down there, on the top and in between his toes. Those itchy bumps were all over, and he did not know if that was the Pfizer shot.  The patient tried different anti-itch creams on it, and that relieved it for a while, but then it came back. He used clobetasol propionate, but it had not worked. They stopped itch for a while but then it does not help. He tried some just plain anti-itch cream (clarified as Gold Bond Anti-Itch Cream) to stop the itching. It stopped itch for a while, but then it did not help. He did not have to use the cream until 3-4 days. It was some prescription from the doctor, but it was for his wife. He tried it, but it did not do anything. The patient stated the injection itself did not give him any problems. The patient was wondering whether he should take the second shot if this one gave him so much trouble. The clinical outcome of discomfort was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.

An 89-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN5318, NDC number: Unknown, Expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 09Feb2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 89-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, second dose of immunoglobulins NOS (IMMUNE GLOBULIN, Formulation: Unknown), intravenously from 01Feb2021 at an unknown dose and frequency for CIDP. Patient received IV Immune Globulin within 2 weeks of vaccination. Recent DX and received 2nd IVIG infusion on 01Feb2021. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing CIDP (he was diagnosed with CIDP which was chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The treatment for CIDP was IVIg infusion), hip surgery from 14Dec2020 (he had hip surgery on 14Dec2020. The surgery was at (Hospital name)), Sulfur drugs (allergies to medications, food, or other products: Sulfur drugs, known allergies: Sulfur drugs). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Jan2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID- 19. It was reported that, caller calling on behalf of the patient. She was his wife of 63 years. He has a real problem. It was complicated. His birthday was (DOB) and he would be 90 years old this summer. He had hip surgery on 14Dec2020. The surgery was at (Hospital Name). He was diagnosed with CIDP which was chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The treatment for CIDP was IVIg infusion. He had infusions for five consecutive days on 24Dec, 25Dec, 26Dec, 27Dec, and 28Dec (unspecified year). He wanted to get COVID vaccine. Pfizer does not have a lot of information for people who get IVIg infusions. On 19Jan2021 he got Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine and had no problems. On 01Feb2021 he had IVIg infusion because he has to wait 28 days between infusions. They had checked with the neurologist and they said a week then they changed it to 10 days. The neurologist said to go ahead because it was nine days. On 09Feb2021 he got second COVID vaccine. That was Tuesday. He was feeling great and walked into the place to get it. He was ok. He woke up yesterday and he was aching all over especially where he had the surgical hip revision on 10Feb2021 at 07:00. It was six inches above the knee to the top of the groin. It was a sharp pain. When he tries to lift his leg to walk it was especially sharp. He was trying to call the surgeon, but he was in surgery all day. The neurologist said to call Pfizer for any information about people who get IVIg infusion and have chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and the COVID vaccine. He walked into (Name) which was where he got it and he felt great. He walked out and came home. He has had no falls or nothing. He just came home. It was like a mystery. There was not a whole lot of information from Pfizer for people that get IVIg infusions except it started with seven days and now wait 10 days. She was trying to research it on the computer and it only says vaccines in general. It says there might be problem with vaccinations with infusions and she has read the literature that pertained to that. The article she read was from three years ago. It may just be a real unusual kind of thing that a person would have IVIg and get the COVID vaccine. She has been on hold for an hour. She has medical power of attorney for her husband. He had no problem with the first one at all. On the vaccine card she could not read the person&#39;s handwriting. Waited to do COVID vaccine on 19Jan2021 when he was in skilled nursing facility. He was in the hospital for 18 days and then went to the skilled nursing facility for 12 days. The only thing that was relevant was did the IVIg have an effect with the COVID vaccine because nothing else had changed. That was the only different thing. Morning after - body pain with continued sharp pain in left leg groin area - site of recent hip replacement on 10Feb2021 at 07:00. Morning of 13Feb2021- rash on right leg - calf region. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The action taken with immunoglobulins NOS for the adverse events was unknown. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.
