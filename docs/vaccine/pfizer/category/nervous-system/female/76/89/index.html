Swelling of the right side of my face started within a few hours later.  Called Drs. , He recommended taking Tylenol.  (Second Day) Next day, felt short of breath, weak, applied ice packs to my face. Third day, felt weak.  By the fourth day, swelling and itching subsided; but skin on my face felt gritty under the skin. Drove me to the doctor&#39;s office the third day.  I was short of breath walking from the car to the door to the doctor&#39;s office.  I was wearing my mask.  I saw a PA; but, she didn&#39;t tell me much of anything.  I don&#39;t think she knew what to say.

                                                Took shot 1/20 and asked the RN if I should take it because I explained I just got over covid, I told her I wasn?t sure how long it was  on Dec 19 I was raking leaves and I thought I should do this because I started having runny nose. I didn?t feel well that afternoon sneezing because I thought it was nothing. As the week went on I started sneezing and coughing and stopped up nose. I always end up with sinus infection when I get a cold Dec 28 I went to the doctor at doctors care and they did a covid test before the doctor would see I tested positive.  I went home and rested, no energy, felt like I was hit by a train, couldn?t breathe, sneezed a lot and hardly coughed.  January 1, I called ambulance and went to hospital, I was sick the first week of January.  I didn?t know that you should wait 90 days to get the vaccine after you?ve had Covid.  After I got the vaccination the adverse reaction, I woke up during the night with my arm hurting bad and throbbing and a very large red circle appeared on my arm 2? in diameter. The next 3 days I felt like I had covid all over again, the 4th day I woke up and felt a little better and got out of bed and started making progress each day. Now I?m not good, but I?m ok.

                                                Patient was observed for 15 minutes after the vaccination administration, felt fine, and left the facility with her husband.  The 2 of them drove 2 blocks away to a restaurant to eat.  Midway through her meal, she reported that she started to feel &#34;funny&#34; like she was &#34;drunk&#34; or something, and felt nausea and hot/sweaty.  Her husband got her in the vehicle and drove to the vaccination facility,  When he arrived, she was obtunded and &#34;out of it.&#34;  No respiratory distress, No noted rash, but some clamminess/diaphoresis.  She was initially examined by FNP and cursory limited neuro exam while patient was seated did not reveal any gross motor deficits.  FNP called 911 and staff called for me.  When I arrived, patient was groggy, but responsive.  She was A&amp;O x3 and in no distress. Pulse 54, strong and regular (normal rate for her per patient--on a Beta blocker).  BP 120/74.  O2 sat 97% on outdoor cold air.  Patient was able to move all extremities equally and with equal strength.  Lungs CTA, Heart regular no murmur, abdomen soft.  Patient complained of continued malaise/grogginess and nausea, no vomiting.  EMS arrived, checked glucose, which was &#34;normal&#34; (I didn&#39;t hear the result) and patient declined transport.  I discussed ER evaluation vs. continued monitoring by me.  Patient and husband requested monitoring.  Patient stayed in the vehicle with her husband, I gave the husband my phone number to call if any worsening.  I checked on her 5 minutes later, then 10 minutes after that.  By that time, her adult daughter had arrived.  We again discussed continue family monitoring  vs. ER.  The family wanted to take the patient home to monitor.  Patient stated &#34;If I could just go to bed, I think I will be fine.&#34;  I called to check on the patient at 6p.  She had rested well and was improved.  She still felt a bit groggy, but otherwise was feeling better.  I called to check on the patient 1/29 at noon.  At that point, husband stated that she was &#34;back to normal. Symptoms and signs appeared to be consistent with a vasovagal response.  I suspected symptoms may have been prolonged by her Beta blocker

I had severe diarrhea and my bowels are still messed up- they are light yellow verging on white. I have been having migraines  and am very weak and shaky. Pain at injection site is trivial. Pain through out my body is not. I am often dizzy.

                                                Two days after receiving the vaccine, I began to have the feeling that my insides (as in my &#34;guts&#34; or my intestines) were on fire. I didn&#39;t have diarrhea, but the feeling was very intense and I had to go to bed. I took Pepto Bismal, hoping it would alleviate the awful feeling. It wasn&#39;t like any other stomach or intestinal upset I&#39;ve ever had. It literally felt as though my insides were &#34;on fire&#34;, inflamed. The feeling persisted for 2 days and then went away. During that time, I just ate tea and toast and hoped that I wouldn&#39;t see any blood in my stool. It was very frightening.

Shot in the arm hurt 1 st day where a 1st doze shot did not hurt till next day, nausea,  weakness all  over and joints hurt.  I took1/2 of 2 percocets  1half every 3 hours for 12 hours and that helped with headache and teeth..tylenol did not help headache and I never have headaches.  I thought I was dying.  I spoke to friends who have had 2nd dose and most experienced some but not all and many nothing after 2nd dose.

Went back to bed.  6 am still hurt everywhere, short of breath (oxygen concentration at 90 and sometimes below--thankfully I had oxygen as I sleep with it).  Running a temperature of 100., disoriented, heart rate at 115&#43; and I hurt everywhere.  8 am called Dr. &amp; left call-back.  1 pm tried Dr. again.  Told person on telephone and he told Nurse Practitioner.  They ordered nose spray because I mentioned I may have a sinus infection as my head hurt, my ears hurt.  I continued Tylenol every 6 hours on Friday and Saturday (all day).  I was able to get up and do a few things on Saturday.  Felt better on Sunday but still weak feeling.  Oxygen saturation back to 95-96 and heart rate under 100.

Felt a little  better next day but knew I was about to pass out so laid down in hallway where my husband found me. Got better as day went on and feel fairly well today.  Also had a mild case of night sweats last night. They were awful  when I actually had COVID - for about  2 weeks.

When I got to my doctor my blood pressure was elevated, it was about 180/88. My blood pressure is never that high. It did go down before I left to 140/84. When we were walking in the elevator after leaving the appointment my gait was unsteady. I felt very weak. I also light headed, and dizzy.  It felt like the feeling of the sedation you have receive  before having surgery. When we made it home I couldn&#39;t even see straight.  This lasted about 2 hours. I feel much better today.

                                                pustules across her back; In her throat she is getting hoarse; itching with the rash; rash that is all over her body; splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist /Two splotches on right hand side; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information Team. A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 26Jan2021 at 14:19 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no previous immunizations. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date. Medical history included allergic to penicillin, bladder infection, in the middle of her chest she had the pain cling through her back, and thyroid getting lazy and does not work. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid getting lazy and does not work, vitamins, and sulfa drugs for bladder infection. It was reported that after getting the first dose of the vaccine the patient noticed she had pustules across her back on an unspecified date. The patient stated she &#34;got this rash from the tips of fingers, even the palm of my hands and it starts right under the neck and goes across my breast, on my belly, on my back and both arms and is now halfway down my shin bone.&#34; On an unspecified date in Jan2021, she noticed this the afternoon of her vaccine around 7:00 when she saw two splotches on her stomach and it kept spreading. Sunday morning she went to Quick Care and yesterday went to her regular doctor. Her doctor gave her prednisone to take 10 mg 4 times a day, and hydroxyzine 10 mg for itching. In her throat she was getting hoarse on an unspecified date and was keeping a water bottle on her desk to keep hydrated. She stated she read on (website) that a rash can be a symptom of the vaccine. The caller asked, &#34;if the pustules burst will this cause anyone to get Covid 19? Is this a possible side effect of the vaccine? How long will this last? Is it okay to get my second shot with this reaction? Is there anything I should be taking to make it go away?&#34; It was further reported that patient received paperwork to call if there was any type of reaction. The patient mentioned she has a rash that was all over her body on 28Jan2021. It was on the top of her hands, in the palm of her hands, on her arms, back, under her breast, on her chest, on her stomach, on her bottom end, it was going down her legs and to her knees at this point. The patient initially stated she noticed the rash on Friday (29Jan2021), she later stated it was Thursday 28Jan2021 when the rash first started. She stated she first noticed splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist on an unspecified date in Jan2021. At first when looking at it she did not think too much about it. Later in the call she further clarified and stated it was possible she noticed these splotches the same day in the evening on the day she got the vaccine. She was not sure. If it was not the same day it was the next day. Friday (29Jan2021), she started to get as initially stated bumps, but later clarified rash under skin and it really proceeded from there. Additionally, it was reported that the rash continued to spread throughout her whole body. It was down to her shin now. Her whole upper body was horrible. She has some across her back. There are pustules on them like a pimple. It was like water in it ready to break. Sunday she went to a (clinic name) to get it looked at. She went Sunday 31Jan2021. She was given an intravenous (IV) and three needles were placed in it. She knows one was a steroid, she does not know what the other two were for, but she thinks one was probably for itching. The patient also confirmed she also experienced itching with the rash on 28Jan2021. It started the same day she noticed the rash. The patient stated it was like a full blown case now. The itching was with the rash on 28Jan2021. The itching and rash has continued to go down her body. It was on her buttocks now. It was hard to sit. It was in private up between her legs and stuff. Her body was almost 80 % full and covered with this stuff. She saw her regular doctor yesterday. The doctor at (clinic name) thought this reaction may have been an allergic reaction to a Sulfa drug she was taking for a bladder infection coincidentally at the same time, but she does not believe this was the case. Stated she had taken that sulfa drug before previously. She does not have the name of the drug to provide of the sulfa drug. She does not have it with her. No blood work was done. She was just looked at. They saw what was going on. The patient also mentioned she went on the internet to do research. She saw on Pfizer page three pictures that resembled what she had going on. It was also reported that the two splotches on right hand side started about 7&#39;clock in the evening. At first did not think anything of it. Thought it was possibly a bug bite at first. Additionally, it was reported that patient went to see a doctor. She was already going to the doctor for a bone density scan and she showed the doctor what was going on at the same time. Her primary doctor thought this was due to the COVID 19 Vaccine. At end of call, patient questioned &#34;if the pustules across upper back and behind neck, will that cause anyone to get COVID 19? Side effect?&#34; The patient had no emergency visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of itching with the rash, rash that is all over her body, and two splotches on right hand side. The patient had not yet recovered from rash that is all over her body while outcome of the events pustules, itching with the rash, in her throat she is getting hoarse, and &#34;splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist /Two splotches on right hand side&#34; was unknown.

Had to grab on to something due to a feeling that I was going to fall. It lasted just a quick second or two.  Happened several times that day.  Like what I would think a TIA would feel like.

I attempted to report this on line at instructed on forms given me when I left the site. however the CODE that was to be sent to my phone never came. I then entered the wed site and attempted to report it there. .  Finally I called my primary Dr and he has instructed me to report this to the person giving the second injection.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

Patient medical history included bladder infection, blood pressure, she has some old age stuff like blood pressure, and she had Thyroid removed and takes a thyroid pill every day and she tends toward GERD. Concomitant medications included she does take other medications, but they are not relevant. Patient previously took Shingles shot for Shingles (Had the first of the Shingles shot but it was before that. She is due for the second one but she is putting it off for the COVID second dose). Patient reported that she got the COVID vaccine and was really excited because seemingly, she had no side effects. The shot did not hurt. Ten days after she go the shot, she got really hot at night and really strong muscle and joint aches on 31Jan2021. She was up almost all night. It just kept waking her up. So, she took something, an Ibuprofen thing to reduce fever and pain. The next night she took one proactively and did not have pain. The third night, she had it again but it was a headache all night and she was hot on 02Feb2021. It only seemed to happen at night. She felt like it was from the vaccine. She was not worried she had COVID. She had no breathing problems and did not feel like she was going to pass out. They said she should wait 48 hours and take a test to see if she had COVID. She did and it was negative. She does not feel any negativity toward the vaccine. She went in for a bladder infection and it was from a doctor&#39;s appointment that she got information and they told her she could go ahead and get it. Since she got the vaccine, she got white bump in the vicinity of the vaccine like a while mole, and another in the vicinity of the area as well. It does not itch or hurt. She noticed it about a week after the shot. She does not know the date. She was still on medication for a bladder infection but it would not have done anything. When she had reaction to the vaccine, it was already 10 days after she got the shot. She had asked them at Kaiser, and they think it was unrelated to any other medication. Outcome of event fever was recovered on 01Feb2021, for white bump near injection site was not recovered and recovering for all other events.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I think I am having a bad reaction to my covid shots.  The first shot was 1/31; a week later on 2/7  I started having headaches that travel around my head: some are behind my eyes and my teeth ache;  some more like migraines that go up the back of my head; some more on the top of my head or on the side.  My sense of taste changed.  My second shot was 2/27.  The day after I slept all day.  The headaches continued (I have had a headache of one kind or another since 2/7).  I had a tooth that broke off last June and was removed on March 8.  I thought the tooth was infected and part of the headache problems, but since then I have been having really bad fibro pain and for the week of 3/8- 12 I ran a fever, had chills and more headaches.  I was on amoxicillin from 3/8 to 3/14, but the tooth was not that badly infected and is healing well.  The headaches do not seem to relate to the tooth.  I have had a headache every day since 2/7 of various intensity and in different areas of my head.  I am extremely fatigued and need to nap some days.  My fibromyalgia symptoms are worse than they ever have been and some nights keep me awake.  I also muscle stiffness and spasms in my neck occasionally.  This is not normal for me. I saw a ARNP on 3/16 and she tested me for neurologic symptoms. Here are her notes:  NEUROLOGIC: negative findings: speech normal, mental status intact, cranial nerves 2-12 intact, gait, including heel, toe, and tandem walking normal, Romberg negative, muscle tone normal, muscle strength normal, rapid alternating movements normal, finger to nose normal, reflexes normal and symmetric   I have a video appointment with my primary care provider 3/26 to discuss this further

                                                The patient&#39;s daughter called to report her mother developed a swollen tongue the evening after her second covid vaccination. It was mild at first but progressed to the point that it was interfering with the patient&#39;s speech.  Her breathing was not affected.  The swelling did subside some when the patient took allergy medication.  I recommended the patient be seen by a doctor, and her daughter agreed, but the patient was not keen on seeking medical care.

                                                She got the vaccine, when she came home she started feeling the fatigue that she felt after the 1st vaccine.  She then started feeling very cold, laid down and watched TV.  She then had chills all night and did not sleep well due to that.  When she got up on Tuesday the chills were gone but had a slight headache off and on throughout the day, her temp was 97.2.  Throughout the day she would get warm spurts/hot flashes, as well as fatigue.  She did sleep that night, and when she got up yesterday morning still had the hot flashes and it was 94.2, and took it twice due to it being so low.  She was like that with fatigue and not able to sit up.  She went to bed, took some Tylenol and rested.  The heat feeling it started going away.  Around dinner time she felt more like herself, the headache was gone and her temp was 97.  She was doing pretty good, and the last thing she had was she felt on her cheeks and noticed a rash on her face, like a prickly heat type rash.  Before she went to bed she put Neosporin on it, and when she got up this morning it was almost gone but still has a tiny few bumps.   The arm itself did not hurt at all.    Feels that it is a stressful situation as to where to get the vaccine and having to travel to get it as it&#39;s not available in locations closer to their homes.  The people at the pharmacy were great, but had to travel and if it wasn&#39;t for her daughter she would probably not have her shot.

After the 2nd one she had muscle aches, headache, freezing cold, and &#34;weird&#34;, and felt really badly then at 9:30 PM, 32 hrs after the 2nd vaccine dose she felt the a-fib started. She had not been in a-fib in many years. Cardiology had already recommended eliquis but she was holding off. She had diltiazem from 2017 that she tried but with out relief. They rate controlled her but she remained in a-fib, started eliquis, and she went home. For 2.5 weeks she had headache and chest pain, other muscle pain, felt horrible, until she stopped the Eliquis.  Since stopping the Eliquis, she still has occasional mild chest pain, and headache, and flushing.   Her current chest pain is left chest, not radiating. The quality varies, stabbing pain in a very small location at times, may be associated with eating.   She did have a stress test years ago and was &#34;fine&#34;.   She had a dental appointment planned that she had to cancel, she has moved it to May 4th.

For three weeks I had sharp, nerve like pain on the top of my shoulder which kept me awake  most of the night.  I thought it would go away.  The sharp pain went away after three weeks, but pain in shoulder and bilateral neck persists.   I saw on 04/09/2021.  She prescribed a muscle relaxant and physical therapy.  The muscle relaxant didn?t help and I didn?t do the p.t.  She offered to refer me to an orthopedist, which I declined.

                                                feeling cold throughout the day; sore area on her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL8982 and expiration date was not reported) intramuscularly on 02Feb2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was scheduled to receive the second dose on 23Feb2021. It was stated that she had heard rumors by word of mouth and blogs that the second shot is a real doozer. Some of the things she had heard were really disturbing and was hearing that a lot of elderly people had died from the second shot. On an unspecified date, patient was having a sore area on her arm and feeling cold throughout the day after receiving the first injection, and state that both of those side effects passed throughout the day. Patient asked how many people had died after receiving the second vaccine and probably doesn&#39;t have right up to the minute information about how many people were dying from this vaccine. Patient reported that she had friends that took the second dose and they all had chills, body aches, headache and fevers. Patient also asked If she don&#39;t take the second shot, or take it months later from now, and a new variant strain comes out, will she more susceptible to the new variant strain by not taking the second shot and being covered totally and stated Dr. (Name)came out and said if she don&#39;t take the second dose, she will be more susceptible to the variant strain attacking her and she could die from it. Patient wanted to know instead of taking her second vaccine next week, can she delay it and take it months from now and asked will the vaccine be effective. Patient wondered why there was no expiration date on her vaccine record card. She made the comment might be because it was so new, that&#39;s why there wasn&#39;t one. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She was cold, shaking, then was tired, joint and muscles aching, and not wanting to move, just wanting to sleep.  No appetite.  She took a baby aspirin, the headache subsided but returned when the aspirin wore off.  She was out of it from Saturday to Sunday morning.  The headache was so severe and she took some Tylenol.  During the night she sweated so much that everything was drenched.  She had to get up and change her clothes again as she was wet from the chills, and urinating a lot possibly due to the water intake.  She feels much better than she did yesterday and Saturday but still having headaches, and not wanting the 2nd vaccine.    She did have COVID in July of 2020 and hospitalized 3 times during that time-frame.  She does not want to experience the same reaction.   She has an APT with her PCP coming up in May.   She was also diagnosed with the regular flu in  January and feels that she has the same symptoms if not worse than what she had experienced in the past.   She did have dizziness a lot and  had to use her walker to steady herself first.

She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question. The reporter considered the events fatigue aggravated serious and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as medically significant. The outcome of the events fatigue aggravated recovering; as for the events blood pressure raised, &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39;, lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired were not recovered; while the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 01Apr2021 (reported as 2 days after). The outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events fatigue aggravated and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as serious (IME).Based on the plausible temporal association and product safety profile, the reported events are possibly related to the vaccine BNT162B2. administration. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Mar2021 13:50 (at 76-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. Medical history included hip replacement four years ago in 2017 (First right then 2 months later left) and knee replacement six years ago in 2015 (both 2 months apart). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6203), administered in Left Arm on 25Feb2021 (at 76-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced bad headaches. The patient received the second dose of vaccine on 17Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, she was not hurting and went to brunch with friends. Afterwards (on the same date, 29Mar2021), she was sitting and got the worst pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. She drove herself home but was in such misery. She went to the emergency room the next day, on 30Mar2021, wherein she had a CT (computerized tomography) scan that showed a blood clot in her lower abdominal area. She was taking pain medication every 6 hours, or she could hardly stand it. On 08Apr2021, she went back to the emergency room because she could hardly stand it. She was kept in observation status but was not admitted. She was scheduled to have another CT scan on 06May2021. She is not sure what they will do because the nerves are wrapped around it. She also mentioned that her doctor wants to do a biopsy. The pain was also running down to her ankle. She stated that she has had both of her hips replaced in the past. She added that her doctor will do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). He will put in a drain if it has not shrunk. The doctor can&#39;t do anything because the nerves are all tangled up (2021). As corrective treatment, the patient was taking pain medication for the blood clot and pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. Outcome of nerves are all tangled up was unknown, while outcome of the other events was not recovered.

As the day went on it got much worse and the nausea started to the point where my husband had to take me to the ER .  They gave me some pain medicine, nausea medicine and did a cat scan of my abdomen. Nothing was found and I was sent home. April 4th the pain got so severe and the dry heaving to the point where blood came out. Again I went into the ER this time by ambulance because I was so weak at that point where I couldn?t walk. Again they gave me pain medicine and nausea medicine along with prednisone. It took about a week to recuperate and now I have severe tinnitus.

My last check in report I would like to change my health status to serious vertigo experience beginning on May 1, 2021.  In the middle of the night while in bed I felt like I was falling.  The next day I had the need to fall to the left side all the way to the floor 2 times safety and felt very dizzy for the 2 days.  I began my balance exercises.  I continue to have frequent serious dizziness episodes since May 1.  Can this recent on set of strong vertigo be a result of the vaccine?  Until now all vertigo expressions were mild.

This is not about that but a week ago I began experiencing sharp pain in my thumbs when I tried to open a jar, pull up my pants, rub my hands together, flush the commode, etc.  I have never had this kind of pain before. I looked on the internet to see what might help and noticed that the pain could possibly be a reaction to the Covid vaccine.  Therefore, I am reporting it to you.

A 76-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 30Jan2021 (76-years-old at the time of vaccination), (Batch/Lot Number: EL9265, Expiry date May2021) as DOSE 2, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took dose 1 PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 09Jan2021 12:30(76-years-old at the time of vaccination), (Batch/Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) as DOSE 1, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation and experienced throat started tightening, Lymph nodes under her jaw were sensitive to the touch, feeling more and more tired, entire body was leaden with lethargy, couldn&#39;t do anything, all her joints were aflame, nauseous, pain in muscles, pain in joints, couldn&#39;t raise either of her arms, chills, low grade fever of 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, Fatigue. Patient was dreading getting the second Covid 19 vaccine. One of the questions on the questionnaire she filled out prior to getting her second dose was if she had a severe reaction to any vaccine. She answered yes but no one at the facility asked her about it. She put that she may have had a severe reaction with the first Covid 19 vaccine but no one at the facility questioned it. She put question marks on the questionnaire on that question to indicate she didn&#39;t know if she had a severe reaction for sure or not. She did want to have protection against the Covid 19 virus, so she did get the second Covid 19 vaccine. After getting the second Covid 19 vaccine she experienced the same thing going home. Her throat tightened. Her jaw and lymph nodes under her jaw were tender. She was tired but didn&#39;t feel the leaden feeling she had with the first Covid 19 vaccine. She was nauseous and had diarrhea. She had muscle pain and joint pain and chills. These symptoms went on for 5 days. She thought she would be ok after the 5 days like she was after her first Covid 19 vaccine dose. On the sixth day she almost passed out in the grocery store. She had to sit on the floor of the grocery store and put her head between her knees. She was dizzy. She was still having the diarrhea, nausea, and chills. It was like having influenza symptoms. She went home that day and got into bed. Then gradually she got better. Maybe around the 9th day after the vaccine she was able to do some things around her house and on the 10th day she was better. Her lymph nodes under her jaw were still swollen. She doesn&#39;t know if what she experienced were normal side effects. She found the Pfizer reporting website obtuse. The website indicates there was a time limit to finish a report. She did not file online because she wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d be able to finish in the time limit. She was grateful for protection against the Covid 19 virus and would get the Covid 19 vaccines all over again, but she was not looking forward to getting a Covid 19 vaccine booster. She reported she was very healthy and active. When probed if she had seen her primary care doctor or gone to the emergency department, she reports the hospital was far away. She was living in a rural area in the mountains and did not trust the closest hospital to her. Her doctor friend who was an ophthalmologist told her that her antibodies were really kicking in and that&#39;s why she had the reaction to the Covid 19 vaccine like she did. When probing adverse events following any other vaccines, she reports she hasn&#39;t had a vaccine since childhood and doesn&#39;t remember having any adverse events from her childhood vaccinations. The last vaccine she had prior to the Covid 19 vaccine was the cold vaccine she received in 1992. She&#39;d like to add she also had a rapid heartbeat with the dizziness on the day she almost passed out in the grocery store. That was the sixth day after the second Covid 19 vaccine on 05Feb2021. Her heartbeat was rapid for about a week after starting on 05Feb2021. The clinical outcome of the events lymph nodes under jaw still swollen was not recovered, remaining all events was unknown.

                                                Saturday evening 1/23/21 after vaccine, just all of a sudden from one moment to the next, left hand was very tingly and tight feeling and could not move very easily.  A few minutes later her lip from the center left was also tingling, and then spread to entire left side of her body from head to feet, like her left side feel asleep that tingly feeling and numbness.  Began to be worried, called 9-1-1 and the EMT reassured her that she was not having a stroke, and told her that they had heard of it before.  Still today, Monday 1/25/21, particularly in her left hand which she is not able to use very much.  Did take Ibuprofen but nothing else.

Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

                                                arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) received via a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies- there&#39;s a whole list of things she couldn&#39;t take; carried an epi pen for years. Concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) to avoid allergies. The patient had the 1st dose yesterday and she&#39;s feeling good. She had no side effects except for a little bit of arm soreness on Jan2021. Her doctor told her to take Tylenol for arm soreness, but another woman told me not to take Tylenol, but the patient didn&#39;t need it anyway (unknown if treatment was received). Her doctor was giving her Zyrtec to avoid allergies because there&#39;s a whole list of things she couldn&#39;t take and have carried an epi pen for years. She took Zyrtec before having the vaccine and would take another before the second dose. Would this make the vaccine less effective? Her appointment was 16Jan2021 and she have already scheduled for 08Feb2021. Do they give you a timetable? What was the timing of the 2nd dose of vaccine? The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

No breathing problems. 5th February 2021 Pfizer 1st dose CV19 vaccine.  Scary symptoms started in grocery store parking lot around 6PM (after vaccine at 8:35A) my legs felt like they were partially paralyzed and I would not be able to walk to the car.  I struggled to walk.  Got home and laid down.  Thought it was side effects to vaccine and it would pass if I went to sleep.  Woke up and felt totally paralyzed and it required a lot of effort to turn on my side to try to reach my phone.  All my muscles and joints ached.  I am never sick and not a complainer.

                                                One hour after receiving the vaccination, I had an uncontrolable bout of diarrhea in a public place. Later in the day, I felt  fatigued, and aching, and my left arm started to get very tight and sore. The next day I felt the same, and my lymph nodes under both my arms began to swell and hurt and my rectum began to have severe pain. Still had  diarrhea.  By day 5 my left arm ,at the site of the injection ,started to swell, get very hot ,and a large, bright red welt appeared which  almost reached my elbow and went across the width of my upper arm..  I called my doctor and went to see her on the next day because it had gotten worse.  She thought it was a local reaction and recommended ice, tylenol and benedryl. Again, as with the first shot, I am not sure if this is an allergic reaction or not., but thought I would report it.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had anaphylactic shock in the past to a sulfur antibiotic. There were no concomitant medications. She stated she did not have an extreme reaction for the first 3-4 days, it was fine and went away. She had fatigue, joint pain, all the regular things and they were easing up. She had an appointment on the 20Jan2021 and thought things were going okay. On day 7, 20Jan2021, that night, she had an extreme reaction of blinding headache, the shakes, her whole body was shaking out of control for hours, her neck froze completely, and she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal (this is still occurring). The patient has had joint paint on 14Jan2021; extreme tiredness, weakness and muscle pain on 15Jan2021; chills, pain in her neck and muscles were so sore from 20Jan2021. She figured that was side effects, and she was handling, and then exactly a week after, she got the shakes so bad she shook for like 5 hours, she had to put nightguard in her mouth to stop from cracking, and severe headaches and her neck completely locked up, she couldn&#39;t move her head, and she still can&#39;t. She had extreme headache, and she went to the ER on 26Jan2021, since she was in really bad shape, they wouldn&#39;t believe her that it was a COVID reaction, she was there for 12 hours, they did every test, she had spinal taps, she had a head X-ray, everything, as they said she had meningitis, but then ruled that out, they wouldn&#39;t believe she was having a reaction to the COVID shot, she can&#39;t move her head, her joints and that are ok otherwise, but she can&#39;t move her head, she has pain in her neck, and she is taking Excedrin for that. She stated her doctor told her to go ahead and take the second dose of the vaccine and just take Tylenol after. She stated Tylenol has no effect whatsoever. If she takes Excedrin the headache will go away and Tylenol won&#39;t budge it. She stated she is taking Excedrin regardless of what the doctor says. When asked for age of onset, states she was on Valium and she was not thinking straight, and asked her husband her age. She was not sure why it was given, now provides name as Diazepam 5mg. Muscle pain is fine now, it went away. She went to the doctor on 20Jan2021, as she had a regular appointment for bloodwork to be done, and said she felt pretty good, she had some reaction but was fine, and that night is when she got shakes and shivers so bad, she had 3 quilts on and couldn&#39;t warm up, her body was out of control, she couldn&#39;t stop, now states for 3-4 hours. Severe headaches started the night of the 20Jan2021. Her neck pain started right after the shakes, so maybe she pulled muscles when she had the shakes, the muscles were so sore, and she couldn&#39;t move her head, like down or to the side, she couldn&#39;t move it, which is why she went to the hospital, to the ER. She was there for 12 hours. She started taking Excedrin, states she ignored what the doctor told her. She knows her body and she can take Tylenol and Ibuprofen like it is candy, and it does nothing, one Excedrin puts everything away, she swears by Excedrin.

                                                Pain; Burning sensation; Hives; Injection site soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: el1284 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 19Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lymphoma from May2020, had chemotherapy for lymphoma from Jun2020 to 08Oct2020, shingles, knee replacement from 2008 and allergic to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she thinks she was having side effects from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine she got 19Jan2021, tomorrow 02Feb2020 was two weeks from when she got it. Patient didn&#39;t have any side effects to start with, just soreness to the injection site on Jan2021. She says last Wednesday, 27Jan2021, she noticed she had hives, not a rash, on her chest on the left side that are kind of on her breast, the top of her breast, which now spread under her arm up to her shoulder area and back. There was pain along with it, a burning sensation starting last night on 31Jan2021 in the inside area. Since she got her injection on her left side, she doesn&#39;t know if this could be a reaction to the injection or not. She had shingles several years ago, this was acting like that, and it looked like one of the side effects listed is lymphadenopathy, which she looked up information about that, but she doesn&#39;t know what it was, she doesn&#39;t know what else to blame it on. Patient hasn&#39;t seen her doctor yet for hives, and has not treated the hives. She got the OK from the nurse who said she didn&#39;t see a reason for her not to get the vaccine since she was coming off chemo several months prior. Patient was considered to be in remission right now, and she has an appointment next week with her oncologist for follow up. Outcome of the events was unknown.

She did empty the water and the grease and she thought well it is going to have to stay there, it was right at the back door so anyway.

She was supposed to have surgery but because of COVID it has been cancelled 3 times. The outcome of the events were unknown.

                                                tiny sore in her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN5318, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at 16:00 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included back surgery on an unknow date and back pain from an unknown date.  Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) for back pain from back surgery. The patient reported that her doctor prescribed Tylenol to ease the back pain after a back surgery that she had before. She is prescribed to take the Tylenol 4 times a day at 6 hour intervals. She stated that she read something about after taking the COVID vaccine to not take Tylenol. At the time of the report she is feeling good with no side effects but based on the report she read that after, she is not supposed to take anything, she wanted to ask will it affect the effectivity as she read in a literature that Tylenol will decrease the efficacy of the COVID vaccine. She was wondering if it is ok for her to continue to take Tylenol. The patient also reported that she only had a tiny sore in her arm on an unspecified date in 2021. She was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The outcome of the event was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious.

                                                She can breathe better moving around but when she sits down, her breathing seems to be congested; Nose started stuffing up again; Her nose just swells; congestion in her chest; her arm was sore/ Little pain in her right leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265) solution for injection, intramuscular on right arm on 01Feb2021 at 09:10 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included breathing problems and COVID-19 on 31Oct2020 in which she waited exactly 90 days to get the vaccine. The patient had a small touch of pneumonia on her lower lobe of her right lung, she was on a lot of antibiotics and a strong herbal solution. She was on one antibiotic for 5 days and another for 7 days. She was on the herbal stuff for 7 days. She took all that stuff and was drinking lemon juice and hot water and breathing in lemon scent and Vicks Salve all in her nose. She also was prescribed an asthma pump. She had all that stuff going into her system. She also was tested, and she has H. Pylori bacteria. She explained her whole family must have that, it&#39;s hereditary. That wasn&#39;t her issue. However, all that she put in her stomach and in her system caused her to have stomach issues. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick. She told the person administering the vaccine that antibiotics made her sick and she was told it didn&#39;t matter and that this wouldn&#39;t interfere with the COVID-19 vaccine. Her stomach was all messed from all that stuff. The patient also has anxiety. She has never been treated with anxiety. She has had anxiety since she was a very young women and she has never been treated for it. When probed for any product information she had available for the medications that messed her stomach up and made her sick she provided the following information: The first medication she took was azithromycin (Z-PAK, lot number: KG0706, expiration date: Nov2021, NDC number: 0781-8089-26) that was dispensed in a little box. Dose was 250 mg which she took daily doses for 5 days. One of the doctors gave her a levofloxacin 50 mg for 7 days. She was given the pump, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL SULFATE HFA INHALATION AEROSOL, lot number: 102B4, expiration data: 20Jan2022) 90mcg per actuation. She explained she only took this once. She was so scared from this stuff. It squirted down her mouth. Another doctor prescribed her omeprazole 40 mg capsule every day because she told him her stomach was messed up. The patient was prescribed amoxicillin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet, by mouth three times daily for 14 days and clarithromycin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet by mouth twice daily for 14 days. The new doctor also had her taking omeprazole (the doctor wrote another prescription for this). However, this time the dose was 20 mg and she was prescribed to take that twice daily for 14 days. She didn&#39;t finish this medication. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick and the doctor explained because of her bacteria, she ordered the antibiotics to make her feel better. The patient told the doctor if she could live like this, let her not take these medications until she gets her stomach better and she would eat healthy food and find natural antibiotics at the health food store. She mentioned using oregano. She took that once a day. When she knew she was getting ready to take the COVID-19 vaccine, she stopped taking that 2 weeks before taking the vaccine. She stopped taking cholesterol medicine at night 2 weeks ago, it was making her sick to her stomach. She stopped her potassium medicine. She didn&#39;t want any of the medicines interfering with the vaccine. The patient also took an herbal medicine that was called a Spiritual, Mental, Emotional, Elevation Science of Eternal Life. It&#39;s a detox mixture that was very strong. She took this for 7 days. She had lost weight because she was not eating. The patient has always been a junk food eater. She quit eating junk food and that probably also had something to do with her being sick. She cooks all her food. There was no additional vaccine administered on the same date with COVID-vaccine. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She has never had a flu vaccine, pneumonia vaccine or shingles vaccine. This was her very first vaccine. Concomitant medication was reported as none. The patient didn&#39;t know if it was anything serious, but she tried to read all the information that was given to her. She was looking at the information and she saw &#34;if you have any difficulty breathing&#34;. That was the only one that she was having. She could breathe better moving around but when she sits down, her breathing seems to be congested. She was calling to see if this was anything serious and if she needed to go the emergency room. Since her breathing has been acting funny, she has been trying to keep moving around. She was cleaning her bathroom and the Bleach Cleaner and other cleaner opened her nose. She was listening to a town hall meeting and when she sat down to listen to it, her nose started stuffing up again. She has just been trying to get up and move around. Since she has been talking on the phone, her breathing was a little better. Her nose just swells. She got up and was beginning to eat breakfast when all of a sudden, the difficulty breathing started happening. It was around 8:45 am this morning (02Feb2021). It has improved, but when she would sit down, it would tighten up and she would have congestion in her chest. Since she has been moving around talking, it has gotten better. Sitting down has something to do with the difficulty breathing. She has had breathing problems before. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, 01Feb2021. She sat for half an hour afterwards and then came home. She then slept all night and stated her arm was sore on Feb2021, but it was feeling better. She also had a little pain in her right leg on the side she received her vaccine on Feb2021, which was currently gone. She wasn&#39;t sure if the breathing problems were from the vaccine or something else. The patient did not go to the emergency room or visited his physician in response to the events. She mentioned that if this continues, she probably will go to urgent care. The outcome of the event dyspnea at rest and respiratory tract congestion was recovering, recovered on Feb2021 for pain in extremity, and unknown for all other events.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EM9801), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 04Feb2021 (Administered between 9:30-10:00AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath. She said it was cold outside by her nephew&#39;s graveside, but she felt she had to fan herself like she was overheated. She said her heart rate was flying, and she had an irregular heart beat. She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell.

She said she has had a total of four COVID-19 Virus tests before, and all her COVID-19 Virus tests have been negative. She clarified she did not have a COVID-19 Virus test while she was at the ER on Saturday, 13Feb2021. With her nephew&#39;s death, getting her COVID-19 Vaccine had left her mind. She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital. She said she didn&#39;t even know that someone had drew blood from her. She said someone put a label on her, and told her the label was to show blood was drawn from her.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing low thyroid and mostly it&#39;s food allergies. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 125 ug, daily for low thyroid. The consumer stated, I took the vaccine on Monday (25Jan2021), three days ago and as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I came prepared because I do have some reactions sometimes. Mostly it&#39;s food allergies but I guess was being prepared, so I took Benadryl with me and I took it out of the packet. When probed for the treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I just took Benadryl as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I was prepared and I took my Benadryl with me and we stayed there I guess about 45 minutes until I felt better it would have been 12:15 and I was fine.&#34; The consumer stated, &#34;I have been trying for two days, that was in my arms hurting a little on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and then today (28Jan2021) around noon I was feeling a reaction again. I had the tightening in my neck and around my mouth area that&#39;s where I usually get the reactions from, but for two days I have been fine and I did not eat anything on an unspecified date in Jan2021 out of the way to give me a reaction to it. Now I took 2 Benadryl and it subsided but it&#39;s still tight around my neck and a little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness. What am I supposed to do? After I took this shot on Monday today is Thursday and I am having the same reactions that I had when I took (incomplete sentence) (pending clarification). The outcome of the events as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange was recovered on 25Jan2021, little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness and tightening in my neck and around my mouth area was not recovered and other events was unknown.

                                                weak feeling; heartbeat climb up and up; unnerving; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 77-year-old female patient received dose 2 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EN5318; expiration date 31May2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Concomitant medications included losartan, escitalopram, and atorvastatin from unknown dates for unspecified indications. The patient received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (lot number EL1284; left arm) on 15Jan2021 at 11:00. The patient previously received codeine on an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced allergy. On 06Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced a weak feeling and heartbeat climb up. The patient had a weak feeling, had to sit down and took her pulse with oximeter and her Apple watch. She watched her heartbeat climb up and up. She tried yoga breathing but could not slow it down. She was not sure how long this went on because it was very unnerving, but it reached as high as 105 before it started to go down. The beats went up, then down, finally started to keep going down. Once more there was a wave of the weakness through her before she stayed in the 73&#43; range. The patient was usually in the 60&#39;s. Since then the patient&#39;s heartbeats have been what is usual for her. During the episode the patient&#39;s husband found &#34;rapid heartbeat&#34; on the paper they received. The patient was concerned this happened a day after the vaccine, not within an hour. The events were reported as non-serious.

After 12 hours the fever gradually subsided as did the pain in my neck and shoulder. Was left with headache that remained overnight but the pressure was not like the day before. Saturday I was just tired, I think from the fever, but by the evening I was back to normal.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on 20Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in right arm to prevent covid. Vaccination Facility Type was Health department. Medical history included rotator cuff challenge. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccine was administered on the same date. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events were following prior vaccinations. Patient was calling about Pfizer Covid vaccine. She had the first shot on 20Jan2021. She did not have a reaction. She went to go get her monthly massage on Saturday (23Jan2021). On Sunday morning (24Jan2021) she started to feel ill and she had to go the hospital. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital. She had chills, aches and pains, it felt like an elephant was on her chest, she had chest spasms, a fever a little shy of 101. She went to hospital and the doctor there told her she had covid since she had all the symptoms. She confirmed she did not have covid and had a negative covid test. She had chest x-ray and an EKG since she thought she was having a heart attack. Reported her massage was primarily on her left shoulder, it was a deep massage on that area since she had a rotator cuff challenge, massage was focused on that shoulder. She was thinking that the vaccine activated all that discomfort since she felt it from the left part of shoulder, went down to her chest like a v, and back up to her right shoulder. Every time she took a breath she had a chest spasm and it was hard to breathe. The events required a visit to emergency room. For treatment, they gave her medication to take called robaxin, it was an anti-spasm, and 800mg of ibuprofen. She took robaxin Sunday night, Monday, and she took one on Tuesday since she was feeling better. She was sensitive to medication. She felt dizzy and nausea from Robaxin. The patient had recovered from the events completely by Wednesday on 27Jan2021. She had a reminder to return for the second dose on 10Feb2021. She was asking if she should get the second dose.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

They had to put me into another room that was much cooler and put me into a recliner with feet up, ice behind my neck and on my forehead. I was pushing water so it was not dehydration, and I had eaten my normal healty breakfast also so not low blood sugar. This was my second shot and I had the same reaction with the first shot. It took about an hour before I could stand and walk again, but was still a bit shaky and faintly light headed for about another hour.

She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included: cholesterol, spinal fusion L4/5, stenosis, allergies to medications, food, or other products: kefex, Zithromax, levofloxacin, oxycontin, methylprednisolone, Lisinopril, ezetimibe, Amlodipine.  She reported she has constant spiking of her blood pressure (BP) and lack of sleep for 37 days (average 1-3 hours daily), since the vaccination. She described the following: She has experienced &#34;dizziness, blurred vision at times, extreme and constant headaches, tons and tons of pain in her neck&#34;. She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function&#34;. When she &#34;lays down&#34;, her &#34;heart is racing so fast and [her] BP gets so high that it won&#39;t let [her] sleep&#34;. She feels like her &#34;body is going crazy&#34;. She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours. So weak &amp; constant neck pain that feels like someone is placing pressure around my neck. The blood pressure medication received are the following: Amlodipine from 1Feb2021 until 9Feb2021. She explained it work well to manage her BP but she &#34;could not urinate and had red flashes in [her] face&#34;; therefore, it was stopped by her cardiologist. She was off the BP medication from 9Feb2021 until 17Feb2021. Metoprolol from 18Feb2021 until 25Feb2021, but it didn&#39;t work. She explained it was stopped by her doctor because of side effects. Propranolol in combination with Alprazolam as needed for anxiety. She explained she &#34;took 3&#34; of the tablets for anxiety. Hydralazine 25mg which she started yesterday, after seeing her cardiologist. She explained she only got 3 hours of sleep last night. She woke up around 1:30am/2am&#34; her heartrate was at &#34;93&#34; and she put heat and cold on her neck to settle the pain. She specified the headache and pain were so bad it lasted for 1.5 hours, and her BP was 150/93 at 3 am .She added she had a &#34;red and flushed face&#34; and therefore took a &#34;Benadryl at 4am&#34;. She explained her BP was down to &#34;125/78&#34;, after taking the Benadryl, but got up to &#34;147/90&#34; at 7 am when she attempted to call Pfizer. She explained she has &#34;done [her] due diligence: she consulted HCP, did all the test, she attempted to go for walks and do activities she can tolerate, but her symptoms persist. She added she use to golf and cannot anymore. She explained her symptoms are persisting until this day and her body won&#39;t handle it further. She mentioned she knows she is COVID-19 free because when helping take care of her quadriplegic son in the summer, she tested negative. Outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : PFIZER INC-2021277006 same patient, different vaccine dose/AE.

                                                She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

Then around 7:00 PM her arm started to get a little sore but kept moving it and massaging it.  She then could not move anything by 10:00 PM, and had gone straight to bed as she felt so bad.  She was dizzy, light headed, and these symptoms continued all night and all day Thursday.  She dozed to sleep off and on all day Thursday and was in so much pain, didn&#39;t have to move to have pain.  She is still having some pain today, but feeling much better.  She still is a little bit dizzy.  Feels as if she laid down she could sleep for a long time.  She has pain in her back area, her arms, her hips.  She did not take anything for her reaction as was told not to take aspirin and does not use other medications.  She feels exhausted and if she moves her arm too much and also her legs then they start to hurt.  Getting in and out of bed is easier today, but she could not get them over the bed to get in or out on Wednesday.  Her neck also hurt to turn.  She had similar symptoms to when she had the COVID virus in November/December.  She had been hospitalized for it twice, was informed that she had a stroke after she had passed out.

This time it quickly turned into tremendous pain; no energy; I slept most of the time; tired; chills; fever; headache; flu-like ache; muscle pain; queasiness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Feb2021 at 13:15 (at the age of 77-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient took the first dose of BNT162b2 (lot number E13246) on 27Jan2021 at right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included High blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol, all managed. The patient had also history of sciatica nerve pain in in early Jan2021, resolved with 5 days of meloxicam. Concomitant medication included atenolol, hydralazine, pravastatin and budesonide/formoterol fumarate (SYMBICORT). The patient reported that 2 hours after vaccination, at home, she felt tired, quickly turned to chills and fever. Body temperature was 99.9 F. She never run temps. This was followed by headache, flu-like ache, muscle pain, queasiness, and just terrible in general. She spoke with nurse who gave her shot to see if I should take any fever reducers. She said try to hold off, but if bad, take Tylenol or Ibuprofen. On 20Feb2021 sciatic nerve just blew up. She had an episode in early January, but Meloxicam worked in 5 days and she was fine. This time it quickly turned into tremendous pain-could not walk without help, trouble getting in or out of bed and to the bathroom. She was screaming out in pain. She started taking Tylenol and then Ibuprofen. Nothing helped. She had a few Meloxicam pills left and took one 22feb2021. Temps were rising daily (101.5) chilled, no energy. She slept most of the time straight chair. Sciatica was better, but not gone. Day 9, she walked outside, temp was normal. She was sent for flu &amp; Covid tests (nasal swab), both negative.  The outcome of events was recovering.    No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                I am 77.  I had the Pfizer vaccine, March 9th,  with a terrible reaction starting 2 days after.  I couldn&#39;t use my brain to think, to read with comprehension, to remember things I wanted to remember and had difficulty finding my words. This lasted for 3 days when the fog began to lift.  I also had some shortness of breath(SOB)  and very low energy.  The CDC has said that when giving the injection it is no longer necessary to aspirate (pull back on the syringe) which I was taught to do as a young nurse to ensure that you are not giving the injection into a vein (blood would appear in the syringe.) It is supposed to be given into the muscle which has plenty of veins so if you don&#39;t aspirate, how will you know if you are injecting into a vein? A week later, I ended up going to the local hospital ER because of the SOB and had Chest xray, EKG, brain Cat Scan and blood work which were all normal. I debated about getting the second shot but decided to get it as long as the injector gave the injection as I had been taught. Fortunately she was very experienced and agreed to inject me using the pullback method after I explained what I had gone through the 1st time. So for the second shot I had the sore arm but no other reaction. I think Dr is making a mistake about the pullback decision.  Do we even know what happens if the vaccine is injected into a vein? I am not certain if my first shot was injected into a vein because the injector never pulled back to check.  I have not heard of anyone else with my experience.

When she got pain in the ambulance then the nausea went away. After the hospital nitro and another shot for the pain, the nausea stopped. After the hospital after this they gave morphine and the pain subsided a little but didn&#39;t totally go away until 6 o&#39;clock in the evening, she still had problems breathing because every time she breathed she got pain under her left rib cage. She says the sweat was at home, real bad, number 10, she broke out in a clammy sweat, on the 6th when she was having pain. She says that after the hospital, a couple days after that, she saw her cardiologists, he told her what happened, it was related to vaccine, it was the muscle that goes around her heart, it was having like a charley horse, he says it felt like you&#39;re having  a heart attack, her tests said her heart was good. She talks about her blood pressure and heart rate, and says 102, 103, it went up to 200 in the ambulance. She says they thought it was a heart attack, her blood pressure was usually low blood pressure and all the symptoms she was having was because of her muscle having a charley horse that felt like it was coming from the heart, if they had contacted him, he said she would have just needed a massive amount of anti-inflammatory and it would have stopped the pain. The events required an emergency room visit. She wanted to know if anybody else has been hospitalized for massive heart attacks and says that&#39;s what she was having. The patient had her second shot on 22Feb2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on an unspecified date; and outcome of the rest of events was unknown.

                                                allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine; 1st dose last 22Jan2021 - 2nd dose was on 08Feb2021; 1st dose last 22Jan2021 - 2nd dose was on 08Feb2021; doesn&#39;t feel good; one heck of a temperature; By doing what she did, if that negated the COVID vaccine/ That&#39;s what she was afraid of; redness and swelling in her right arm; redness and swelling in her right arm; feeling hot all over the body; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 77-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included weakened immune system because of the alcohol allergy (started while 19), and aches and pains. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (expiry date May2021) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 77 years old last 22Jan2021 administered on the upper righthand arm later clarified as upper right arm; and she was still going through that systemic reaction when she had her first COVID vaccine. The patient asked on regarding how effective the vaccine was related to receiving steroid therapy. Patient was advised by doctor to go to urgent care to have a covid test to see if she and husband were exposed to covid before the vaccines kicked in.  Patient stated that on an unspecified date in 2021, she still didn&#39;t feel well and was running one heck of a temperature (increased). Patient reported she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. She filled out the forms. Patient felt like she should be put in the hospital. She has a horrific allergy to alcohol. Each time she receives an injection it gets worse. She knew when she received the second dose that the third ingredient was alcohol. She thought about was worse, the virus or the reaction. Within a minute of taking the vaccine she had a reaction. She reported it at the site and was watched for a half hour. Her question was &#34;because she took prednisone immediately after getting the vaccine does that negate the shot?&#34; She was not asked the name of the steroid that she took. She was taking prednisone 20mg, 2 tablets as soon as she gets a shot then 2 daily Monday-Friday. It was still going through her system and it was reeking havoc on her. If she goes to the hospital they will give her Benadryl and monitor her. Patient stated that on 08Feb2021, she had an allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine. Patient stated that she had both COVID shots and had adverse reactions and took some medicine for the adverse reaction and now the patient was concerned it might mess with the shot, it might not work for her as it should. She knew that this was going to be a long process and she knew her allergies were rare, but they were there. She is allergic to isopropyl alcohol, even if it is in shampoos or liquid soaps, she gets reactions. She had her first COVID vaccine and she had her own hospital cleanser that she has with her at all times and she used it which was not a problem. For her second COVID vaccine, the nurse was naming the 3 ingredients that were in the COVID vaccine and asked if she was allergic to any. She said this last shot had alcohol in it, she sat with her husband next to her, and thought which was worse: getting COVID, the cases in the city are high, or having a reaction to the alcohol. She chose the latter. When it went into her arm she immediately knew she was getting a reaction. She had steroids with her just in case this happened. Each time the reaction happens, it gets worse. She said she sat for half an hour and has been on steroids until last Friday. She was supposed to be on them for days. On Friday, she was wondering if taking the steroids negated the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine and that&#39;s why she called in. She knew that this was rare and it was not something that the company going to say that the company know how to fix it. Patient worked in the health unit of a university as a hiring and firing people person. So, she was around it, but she was not a doctor or a nurse. So, she guessed the answer was no. Last week she received her second COVID vaccine. She said, she has got to get rid of 5 pounds, but it&#39;s harder to do that when you&#39;re older. She experienced the reaction from the isopropyl alcohol within her second dose of the COVID vaccine last week, 08Feb2021. She said she was still going through it and will for a while. When asked for the outcome, she said she couldn&#39;t answer that honestly. She said she didn&#39;t feel good (2021). Period. She knew that when she goes through this it takes, each time, an extra 4 to 5 days to get over it. When she got up this morning, she didn&#39;t feel good. Her husband asked if she wanted to go sailing, and she said not in 30 degree weather, but for her to say no to sailing, her husband knew she didn&#39;t feel well. She couldn&#39;t say worse, but she can say she didn&#39;t know how long it was going to be, which was scaring her. By doing what she did, if that negated the COVID vaccine, then lets go from there. That&#39;s what she was afraid of. When she tells people she is allergic to alcohol, and when it happens, they look at her like &#34;nobody is allergic to alcohol.&#34; She is 77 and has the aches and pains of a 77 year old, which she hates. But she doesn&#39;t think there are related medical conditions to what she experienced. This (allergy to alcohol) started when she was 19 and it has gotten progressively worse. So she tries to be careful. She says this was her, not dumb, but her decision that she made and now she is concerned.  She said no to any tests done. She had the immediate reaction and she knew what to do. Patient further reported that she has allergy to alcohol and had an adverse reaction after the 2nd shot due to alcohol swab and on an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced redness and swelling in her right arm and feeling hot all over the body. Patient asked if her doctor will prescribe Benadryl to manage my allergy will it affect the effectiveness of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The patient did not recover from the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The outcome of the other events reported was unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 08Mar2021 15:30 (3:30 PM) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hashimottos (reported as hoshimottos) Diagnosed 35 years ago, hypermobile Diagnosed 20 years ago, and disorder nomia Diagnosed 25 years ago; all unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); diazepam (VALIUM); and levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 on 15Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization first dose at the left arm and experienced immobile for a day, cannot walk, weakness and sore arm. The patient was to know if there is going to be a booster for the Pfizer covid vaccine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer covid vaccine both doses and she is calling to report the reaction she had with the first and second dose to help other patients, she said she was close to death after the second dose. In the middle of the night she was awaken due to excruciating pain in the body, like truck ran over her. The patient heard that someone had same reaction who was in the hospital, with similar symptoms to covid. She said she felt like if her internal organ were shutting down. She does not do well with the antibiotic, and does not go to the doctors. She could not walk or eat after the second dose. She said she has hashimoto dysautonomia hypermobility. she said she thinks she might have had anaphylactic reaction. The patient added that she has lived through it and her experience has been very unusual. The caller has underlying conditions that may have caused this event, she received the second dose on 08Mar2021, it was a horrible experience but since she is still alive she would want to report it. The caller does have strange reactions to chemicals and she typically goes to naturopaths and holistic doctors because of this. The caller also has multiple autoimmune disorders and feels like that may have played a part in this reaction. It was added that further added that she received her second dose 08Mar2021 at 3:30pm and had a little bit of a sore arm, she was thinking positive thoughts about all of this because she never gets vaccines. At 2:00am on 09Mar2021 the caller was awaken in excruciating pain, every surgery she has had or accident manifests in the greatest pain. The pain was excruciating the caller took over the counter pain medicine and diclofenac and it didn&#39;t help. The caller is unsure of what she took, she may be making this up. The caller felt like she was dying, she felt like her internal organs were shutting down, it happened all week. The caller was so weak her husband fed her and made sure she was drinking. The caller thinks she would die if she had to have a booster shot of this vaccine. The caller has never had anaphylactic shock, could this have been anaphylactic shock? All of the pain from a surgery all occurred at once and her entire body was wrecking, in horrible pain, that she does not think heroin could have taken care of. After the second vaccine she was literally so weak that she felt like all of her vital organs were shutting down and it lasted for 6 days, like she got hit by a truck, like had beat her up. The caller knows that there are new found reactions with (Company name) and they stopped thousands of doses because of it, she saw this in the news today. The patient wanted to make note that she has underlying autoimmune diseases, she is unsure if there is a correlation between this and her reaction. The caller was changing from her thyroid medicine and her thyroid went very high with the generic brand so she was swapped to Synthroid in the middle of this. The caller was on levothyroxine and it wasn&#39;t working, her thyroid was sky high (Unknown lot number and expiration date Feb2022). The caller was going through all of these changes as well when she received the vaccine. The caller&#39;s doctor took a test and the caller has antibodies and they are there but not very strong. The caller doesn&#39;t want to be spreading something because she is feeling healthy and fine today. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Advice has been: try heat, try ice, try movement, try stretching, try Voltaren [Diclofenac]... info from any doctor I could ask, from nurse help-line, any nurse or anyone who might have an answer. I TRIED EVERYTHING THAT WAS SUGGESTED, and soreness is still there.  CAN YOU HELP??

This 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0171), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies and sinus headaches which she takes (Excedrin) off and on for years in the past, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included atenolol (manufacturer unknown) taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported. Past drug history included the patient received a flu shot (unspecified Flu shot) with a mega reaction she was sick for weeks which was at least probably 15-20 years ago So, she never got a flu shot after that and she has never had the flu. On 29Apr2021, the patient had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, dizzy/light headed, felt like I am going to faint, and ringing in the ears. On an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced allergic reaction. On 01May2021, she was really ill, and her blood pressure went up over 220 and pulse rate went way up. On 02May2021, she experienced headaches. On 06May2021, she was feeling a little weird and nauseous. On an unspecified date in May2021, her memory is a little off right now. The clinical course was as follows: the patient reported, &#34;I had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, it&#39;s okay now, I couldn&#39;t really move it. I feel I may be having a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine) got on Thursday (29Apr2021) of this past week. I am very light headed, dizzy and felt like I am going to faint, has ringing in the ears, and all that has been going on about a week, since last Thursday (29Apr2021). Then I was really ill last night (01May2021). It started last night when we went to bed around 11 O&#39;clock. I have never had anything like this in my life. My blood pressure was through the roof. With a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope, her blood pressure went up over 220 which was so high that had never happened before, so I took an extra pill (atenolol 25 mg tablet) last night (01May2021) which helped a little bit but not enough, and I really thought that I was going to pass out and be really sick. Because I thought that it was either having a stroke or a heart attack, my husband had to call ambulance to take me to the hospital last night. The systolic and diastolic and pulse rate went way up.  They did chest x-ray, blood work, and urinalysis, and everything came back fine and they could not find anything. They just felt that I was just having a major reaction to the shot so they sent me home. I just got home this morning (02May2021) from having to go to the emergency room. But as soon as we got home, I started with a humongous headache and so I had Excedrin/Tylenol for headaches because I used to get sinus headaches. So, I took that, and it helped a little bit, my headache got a little better. Anyhow, I am much better right now and I am sleeping. But tomorrow it will be the same.&#34; Later the patient also reported, &#34;Today (06May2021) I am feeling a little weird with ringing of ears and is light headed sometimes. Because of the light headedness, I feels a little nauseous. But I am a still very nauseous. I feel like I am going to faint again and my blood pressure I think has gone back up. I am trying to keep calm and trying to figure out what is going on. But I am really afraid if I am having a reaction to the vaccine unfortunately. I am dizzy and I do not want to start getting worst again. I guess I will feel better if you tell me that this happens sometimes and what can I do to decrease somehow?&#34; She also stated that she did contact her doctor about this event but she didn&#39;t get very far. Her memory is a little off right now because she really has not felt well. She stated that her biggest thing is her blood pressure. She also stated, &#34;The only thing that I am really concerned now is about getting the second shot because I already had the reactions by the first shot. Am I going to face the same thing or even the worse with the second shot?&#34; Treatments were received for her blood pressure went up over 220 and headaches. The clinical outcomes of the event &#34;a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine&#34; resolved on 01May2021, the event nauseous was not resolved, while the events, allergic reaction, really ill, felt like I am going to faint, pulse rate went way up, ringing in the ears, dizzy/light headed, Headaches, feeling a little weird and memory is a little off right now were unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12May2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0168) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included acne and migraine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 12May2021, patient experienced soreness in arm. On 13May2021, she had symptoms of rash on her face and it&#39;s itching, and the rash started in her face and ear, all on the left side, on her ear half way down the outside of the ear. She could see all the pimples on the face so she put hot water on it and used rubbing alcohol, which she thought would help curb the itching and dry it up, the bottom of the ear lobe is very much active going into jaw area still. She also had headache, and tiredness following her dose, the doctor told her if headache was severe, take a Tylenol with codeine, she took something with codeine and it went away after about three hours. She also had some breast pain (only in the enfold of her breast closest to the middle of her chest), sore to the touch, and it was very sore for about 24 hours, and that it hasn&#39;t fully resolved. Then, while bathing, she noticed a knot in the vaginal area right in the fold of pelvis and thigh inside of the pelvis that was painful, large, and the size of a quarter, if she push on the pelvic bone area, it would be painful. Also, while bathing, she identified cysts in the rectal area; after bathing she was trying to identify what they were, when she touched it, it hurt, it felt like a ball and eventually it went down and she caused them to bleed, not a lot of blood, just a small amount. She also started getting more growths in the vaginal area/bottom area near the rectum. Patient got sleepy and now made herself go lay down and she doesn&#39;t usually do that.

They did not think the Gabapentin was part of it. Confirmed with caller that neuropathy medication was Gabapentin. They did not think pill had anything to do with it. Caller stated that she had been on it for at least 4 years. She had been afraid to start on something else. She said everything had something. Caller reported that she has been back on 2 pills of Gabapentin for 3 weeks now. On unspecified date, the end of her fingers and toes are still hurting and feel frozen. At her next appointment, she wanted to know if can go on 3 pills and then cut back. She had it for 4 years, but it got worse. This was under control, the neuropathy, and now all of this threw it out of control. Caller stated that everything calmed down about 9 days later. She had problem with her eyes, she did not have to sit inside in the dark. The neuropathy was there but not quite as painful. After going down to 1 pill of Gabapentin, it got worse. In the past she had dry eyes. She went to 3 different doctors and had different eye drops. They mentioned that her blink was not normal. They put plugs in and for about year, her eyes didn&#39;t bother her. At her first appointment, she checked her eyes. She ordered permanent plugs for her eyes for her dry eyes. She had slow abnormal blink on 21Feb2021. Very slow blink. It was causing eyes to be dry. They had suspicion that it was Benign Essential Blepharospasm on unspecified date. She wanted her to stop taking the Gabapentin as side effect is loss of muscle. On unspecified date, her eyes were red and irritated when she was in for her treatment. She was having hard time in there. Her next appointment was 19Mar2021. Caller said her first appointment was 09Mar2021 and she put in plugs. Her vision was blurry. PRIVACY felt she definitely had Benign Essential Blepharospasm. She talked to other doctors and it was agreed this is what she had. The only cure for Benign Essential Blepharospasm is these little Botox injections in her eye. Caller stated on 23Mar2021 she went back. Her eyes were getting worse. She had abnormal blinking problems opening and closing her eyes. She injected Botox on top. Her vision was clear and her blink was back to normal. This only lasted for half an hour. At the visit she saw white circle around the cornea. Caller stated the cure didn&#39;t work. Next visit was 30Mar2021. Her eyes were getting worse and worse, mainly only the whites of her eyes were showing. She was having trouble keeping her eyes open. Caller said that a few years ago she got up 3 times in the middle of the night and it took a minute or two to get her eyes open. Her fear was that she couldn&#39;t get her eyes open. Caller stated that it was exhausting to keep her eyes open. She got medicine drops to keep her eyes open. 06Apr2021 the white circle around her cornea was getting smaller. It was still blurry. It was burning, but it was a pinch better. She had more control over the muscle. The drops were Apraclonidine ophthalmic drops. At this point her eyes were barely open. Mostly saw whites of eyes. Barely color. Caller stated that she started 2 pills of Gabapentin. On 19Apr2021 white around cornea gone. She had blurry days but also clear ones. They ordered MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging). Her blink was still abnormally slow. When she tried to read or watch TV, it strained her eyes. 02May2021 MRI was done. She saw PRIVACY 03May2021 for treatment and he already had MRI results. MRI normal. They talked about Gabapentin and said he did not believe it was that. Caller says she told him that she had gone back on it. She was getting more muscle control. She continued to use ointment that they had given to her. She told her not to drive. She used the ointment twice daily. It was Erythromycin 5mg. She put in in her eyes twice daily. On 07May2021 appointment PRIVACY said vision was 20/30. It was 20/50 when it was bad. The white circle in her eyes was slightly back. Seeing improvement. On 21May2021 was last appointment. PRIVACY checked her vision and it was 20/25. Caller said she was dancing around. She looked so much better. Her blink was more normal. PRIVACY confirmed that all of the problems were from the second dose. Caller stated that her friend knew a scientist that said that if it was from vaccine, it would take at least 3 months to get normal. It is getting more normal, her eyes. She is driving. Once in awhile it gets a little blurry but mostly pretty clear. It is nothing like before. She could only read one line and texting she knew where it was. She mainly sat around with her eyes closed resting them. Her biggest fear was they would close and not open. Treatment for the events slow abnormal blink, Benign Essential Blepharospasm, her eyes were red and irritated, vision was blurry, white circle around the cornea included Eye plugs, Apraclonidine ophthalmic drops, Botox on eyes, Erythromycin Ointment. She had transplant 3 years ago, bone and blood for Multiple Myeloma. Her doctors researched the chemotherapy she had for the transplant to see if it had anything to do with this. Caller than gave more information regarding the transplant. She had pneumonia. She was supposed to have transplant. There was a shadow on her lung. She had CT scan on unspecified date. She had to cancel her transplant. Something was in the lung. They did a biopsy on her lung (unspecified date). During the biopsy, they pulled her arm down hard. That is when the neuropathy started. She had fungus from the pneumonia. It took 3 months to heal the fungus. Cancer was back up higher than the first time. When it was down low enough, she had the transplant. Caller stated that day or two after blood test for Myasthenia Gravis, she had difficulty swallowing. She looked at internet. She thinks it was just nerves and trying to keep her eyes open. It was exhausting. She called a girl to come stay with her and it went away. When she looked at the internet, she got shook up. The events neuropathy felt worse, extremely sensitive to light, slow abnormal blink, benign essential blepharospasm, her eyes were red and irritated, vision was blurry, white circle around the cornea, muscle spasms in right arm and under right breast and going across her stomach and in legs at times resulted in physician office visit.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0178; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25May2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 77-year-old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation at Clinic. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure, high cholesterol and it runs in her family (She has tried all the different &#34;statin&#34; medications and she couldn&#39;t tolerate any of them. Her cardiologist told her there was an injection she could take for her cholesterol every two weeks and it was supposed to be like a &#34;liquid plumber&#34; for your veins. She is so sensitive to medications including all these &#34;statin&#34; medications, there is no way she can take the bi-weekly injection. It might have a much more profound negative affect on her. She was so leery of taking medications, even over the counter medications), gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 4 cardiac stent placements in 2015, blood pressure abnormal, allergies (unspecified), sinus are swollen, neuralgia, cataract surgery (a year and half ago), retina had swelled and sensitivity to heat. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRINE) chewable tablets at a dose of 81 mg daily for sinuses are swollen (her sinuses are not swollen at this time), loteprednol etabonate (LOTREL) for blood pressure abnormal. The Lotrel keeps her blood pressure around 120/70mmHg, famotidine (PEPCID) for gastrooesophageal reflux disease. The patient previously took tylenol and experienced allergy and giant hives. Aspirin give her hives but usually a hive here or there, not real big hives, ilevro for retina swelling and affected her skin on her face (She did have a problem while she was taking the steroid eye drops. They made her feel very unwell. She does not take Prednisone for the same reason. She had tried many different steroid eye drops and so many of them gave her a problem. She ended up taking Ilevro. She had no choice but to take it. The Ilevro affected the skin on her face. Her retinas had to stop swelling. Everything is fine now. She has no glaucoma or macular degeneration. This occurred a year and half ago when she had her cataract surgery). She had given the nurse who gave her the injection a list of all her allergies and sensitivities and the nurse reviewed the list and didn&#39;t see anything in the Covid 19 vaccine that would cause the caller harm based on her list of allergies and sensitivities. The caller took a deep breath and prayed while she received the Covid 19 vaccine. After the vaccine she waited at the facility and she was fine and then she left to go home. She ever had an adverse event with any other vaccines she reports she has not been vaccinated with anything since she was a child. She didn&#39;t even have the Polio vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the suspect vaccine. After getting the Covid 19 vaccine, on an unspecified date, the patient had 5 days of exhaustion where she felt like she couldn&#39;t get out of her chair and she was also very aware of her stomach. Her stomach wasn&#39;t upset but she was aware of it. That slowly passed and she started doing the things she needed to do. She needs to walk because of her heart stents. She had been fine after the Covid 19 vaccine until last night on 10Jun2021 at 21:30 the patient skin on her left leg started to hurt so much that it reminded of her of having a neuralgia. She provides an example of her sometimes feeling a draft and she can develop a neuralgia from the draft for a day or two. That&#39;s what her leg felt like initially. As the night wore on, around 22:00, she realized she couldn&#39;t even stand clothes on her legs. She wears nightgowns, not pajamas and she had to take her nightgown off her leg. The sensation in her leg started changing, she could feel that she not only had the skin hurting sensation but now she had stinging in certain parts of her leg. She had stinging on the top and behind her knee and it traveled down towards her ankle and up towards her upper thigh. It was bizarre. She thought about it this morning, 11Jun2021, what it felt like. She remembered way back, long ago, and she was not a sun person, but it felt like how a sunburn would feel. The skin on her left leg feels burning. She used Aspercreme on her leg thinking it will help with the pain. She wiped all the Aspercreme off her leg. She could not cover her left leg. Her left leg felt like it needed cold and not heat. She does have a history of sensitivity to heat. She runs her air conditioner, and she had a ceiling fan above her bed. She had her left leg exposed and out of her bed covers to try and get the cold air on her hot leg. Finally, around 23:30, her leg still bothered her, but she was able to go to sleep. She twisted and turned at night but was finally able to put her bed cover back on her leg but lightly. The sensation was still there in her leg. She was so sensitive. On an unspecified date, the patient had two twinges in her arm and then her arm never hurt again. The events did not result in emergency room or Physician Office. She is due for her second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Jun2021. The outcome of the events she had 5 days of exhaustion where she felt like she couldn&#39;t get out of her chair, she was also very aware of her stomach, two twinges in her arm was unknown and the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on lot/batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

She tried to take off her sweatshirt and her arm froze--this is the last thing she remembers.  Husband called 911 and she went to the ER.  She had had a seizure and they found 2  brain lesions. She had a CT scan and an MRI in the ER.   There was memory loss in the beginning and slurring of words.  She felt a weighty fatigue.  Was put on Keppra for seizures.  Had consults with neurology, a neurosurgeon, a neuro-oncologist--all unsure of what exactly these brain lesions were.   Back left lower part of brain:  a small lesion, which was basically ignored Right side, towards front, part of brain, on top of and/or intertwined with motor strip:  not sure what this is, a stroke or tumor (the neurosurgeon and neurologist had differing opinions) 2/22--1st MRI--shows 2 spots  between these 2 MRIs the bloodwork, CT scan, and ultrasound are done--results normal 3/23--2nd MRI--larger lesion is bigger.  Was not thought to be a cancerous tumor 4/23--3rd MRI--Looks like larger lesion is improving.  A scheduled brain biopsy is postponed 5/20--4th MRI--the small spot is almost gone and the larger spot is much smaller, about 1/8th the size of the February MRI.  According to the neuro-oncologist, this was an atypical stroke.

She is a shell of who she was and our family just simply misses her,I truly just wish that we would have had been warned of the possible risks to patients like her prior to getting the vaccine.No matter how small the possibility of adverse reaction.We would have chosen to keep her longer.

A 77-year-old female patient received bNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number&amp; Expiry date not reported) via unspecified route of administration in arm on 03Jun2021 (at age of 77-year-old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 Immunization. Patient medical history includes Memory Loss, Breast Cancer, Allergic to Sulfa Medication, Flexeril, Allergic to Clams and Shellfish, Pneumonia, Urinary infection. Patient concomitant medications were not reported. Caller reporting on behalf of his wife who received her first Covid 19 vaccine on 03Jun2021 and she developed pneumonia and a urinary infection. She was prescribed amoxicillin for her infection. The caller wanted to know how the antibiotic will affect his wife. He reports her second Covid 19 vaccine is past due by 2 weeks. He reports his wife gets pneumonia every year and it is not from the Covid 19 vaccine. She received her first Covid 19 vaccine on 03Jun2021 and was due for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 24Jun2021. This is discrepant from the above information that his wife is past due by 2 weeks but is documented as provided by the caller. She will not be able to get the second Covid 19 vaccine until the first week in Jul2021. She waited because she was prescribed a Z-pack for her pneumonia started on 29Jun2021.She developed a urinary infection, she has a history of getting urinary infections too. The doctor also wanted a chest x-ray to make sure that her pneumonia was gone. The Amoxicillin will double check that his wife has no more pneumonia and will clear up her urinary infection. She was hospitalized in 2019 because of a urinary infection. The doctor prescribed Amoxicillin and she cannot wait any longer to get her second Covid 19 vaccine. She must get her second Covid 19 vaccine before time runs out. He reports none of this has to do with the Covid 19 vaccine. These are problems that his wife has had before.Upon follow up when probing for information regarding the sore arm he and his wife experienced he reports the sore arm was minor, it was just where the injection was in jun2021. His wife had breast cancer and can only get injections in one of her arms. It was a little soreness, nothing, barely noticeable. He and his wife did exactly what the pharmacist said, they took a lot of fluids, drank Gatorade for electrolytes. He reports his wife is sleeping right now because she was at the doctor&#39;s office this morning. He reports his wife&#39;s doctor is being thorough before his wife gets the second Covid 19 vaccine. He is supposed to call the pharmacy to schedule his wife&#39;s second Covid 19 vaccine on 03Jul2021. The pharmacist told him not to cancel his wife original appointment because it would remove her from the system. He&#39;s will call on 03Jul2021 and hopefully his wife will be able to get her second dose on 05Jul2021 or 06Jul2021. At that time, she&#39;ll almost be off the Amoxicillin. He is asking what the effectiveness rate is of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine while on an antibiotic.The pharmacist told him the effectiveness is diminished for people who have taken an antibiotic. He believes the first Covid 19 vaccine provides 70% effectiveness while the second Covid 19 vaccine provides 95% effectiveness. His sister-in-law has titanium plates in her back and must take an antibiotic for the rest of her life and she received the Covid 19 vaccine. Advised in response to caller to discuss with Health care professional about the final decision about receiving the second dose to discuss the risks and benefits of the administration of the vaccine and the HCP is most familiar with the health history of his wife. Pfizer is unable to make treatment recommendations for individual patients. Patient underwent lab test and procedures include Chest X-ray result was it showed nothing, no pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2 test was negative; Urine analysis result was unknown; all tests done on Jun2021. The outcome of event was unknown.   Follow up (29Jun2021): This is a follow up spontaneous report from a Pfizer Sponsored Program. A contactable consumer reported for a 77-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s wife) that: New information include medical history, schedule of second dose, Lab test, event little sore arm, visit of physician office.   No further information is provided or obtained.Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                At approximately 930am I arrived at Memory Care.  I met with the director of the facility and she directed me to where my team would be setting up.  My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt&#39;s room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her. She also stated that the hospice Nurse believes that the death was primarily caused by her detiorating state. She also stated that the hospice Nurse informed that the death was not due to the Vaccine. Per Lead Pharmacist at the clinic.

                                                When I awoke this morning and was getting dressed, I noticed a soreness in the back of my left leg (on the right side of the left leg).  I felt a lump,  It was about 2-3 inches above the knee.  It was what I would describe as a medium-sized lump.  I called my doctor to leave a message about my symptoms.  My doctor called  a few minutes after 11 am and asked me to immediately come in so he could see the lump.  He thought I might have a blood clot.  This lump was not present late last night because when I put lotion on my legs after my shower, I felt no lump or soreness.  I worked out this morning and by 11:00, it seemed to me the lump was not as big as it was when I was getting dressed earlier this morning.

Then she woke up in a horrible sweat but by the following morning it was gone. She wouldn&#39;t say it was a horrible reaction but she wanted to be certain she can go ahead and get the second shot which she had an appointment for. She said everything has resolved completely except for the swelling, her arm was still swollen, itchy, and red. Since the swelling, redness and itchiness began she would say it was slightly better than it was. The patient received the vaccine at an independent assisted living facility, not a military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events chills, feeling very hot and woke up in a horrible sweat was recovered on 14Jan2021, while the remaining events was recovering.

                                                I began feeling weak around 3:15 and was worse by 4 PM. Then I began having shivers but no temp. I felt weak and pulse raced as soon as I got up and walked around. Some aches and pains and malaise but I slept all night. Next day still felt poorly but no chills. Got a cold spell towards evening bu lasted about 1 hr. Some slight congestions that was relieved with a good cough maybe twice a day for another couple of days. That is all.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the covid vaccine, I developed a red flush on my face which was bright, hot and uncomfortable. The flush appeared nowhere else on my  body so I concluded that the vaccine must have interacted with the tretinoin cream I use nightly. That is the only area of my skin on which i apply the cream. When I got home, I applied soothing skin cream but no relief. I then tried aloe, which grows in the area, and the flush/burning abated somewhat. The next day, my face was still flushed but less red. the skin surface was scaly. I am continuing to treat at home. No MDs involved.

                                                little depressed; not feeling like herself; weak; tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose on the left arm on 19Dec2020 10:30 (lot number: EL0140). Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had no side effects after the first vaccine except for a little tenderness which went away. On 11Jan2021, after receiving the second dose, she felt really tired but which went away. On 20Jan2021 (last Wednesday), she started to feel tired, weak, and not feeling like herself. On 22Jan2021, the patient was a little depressed. She did not have a headache. Her blood pressure was fine and she never had a fever. She had an X-ray back in Sep2020. Her vision is good. She is not hurting anywhere. She doesn&#39;t feel as strong. She doesn&#39;t understand the tiredness, weakness, and depression. Outcome of the event tired was recovered on 11Jan2021, of the events doesn&#39;t feel like herself and weak was not recovered, and of the event depression was recovering. The reporter assessed all the events as related to the bnt162b2. The events depression and doesn&#39;t feel like herself were reported as serious: medically significant while the other events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory role of bnt162b2 in triggering the onset depression and doesn&#39;t feel like herself cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I also felt very stiff and uncomfortable.  Sore neck and joint pain and a slight headache.  I had a sore area across my arm (felt like a bruise although there was no discoloration) about 1 inch inch below the injection sight which was on my upper left arm.  That persisted for several days. I slept and took 1 800 mg Ibuprofen (on   1/27/2021). Am feeling better but still not feeling 100 %.  That may be due to increased allergies due to time of year of etc a

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) from a Pfizer Sponsored program.  A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 25Jan2021 at 13:00 (at 78 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included anxiety, headache, dry eye and low potassium, each from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included potassium oral at 10 meq daily for low potassium, cholecalciferol (D3) oral at 2000 iU once a day to help with bones, fish oil oral at 1200 mg once a day, alprazolam at 0.5 mg as needed (take one three times a day) for anxiety, clonazepam oral at 0.5 mg once a day for anxiety, nortriptyline HCl oral at 10 mg once a day, paracetamol (TYLENOL) at 500 mg as needed for headache, estradiol (SYSTEN) ophthalmic one drop as needed, all from an unknown date and ongoing.  The patient experienced one or two hours after the vaccine (on 25Jan2021), she went to talk, she couldn&#39;t get her sentence straight. She knew what she wanted to say but she couldn&#39;t say it. Her first thought was that she was having a stroke and it really scared her. She became very tired and went to sleep, when she woke up, she was talking straight but she was still really tired. The next morning (on 26Jan2021) she had diarrhea three time and after that she felt better. The patient outcome of speech disorder and diarrhea was recovered on 26Jan2021 and the outcome of tiredness was recovering.  The information on the batch number has been requested.

Medical history included non-hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from Jul2019 and ongoing (The first time she was diagnosed was Jul2019. She then went into remission and then got the cancer back, she doesn&#39;t know when. She knows they started treating it as the cancer had returned in Aug 2020), watering eyes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine), chemotherapy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (she is a cancer patient on chemotherapy), fever blister from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced she had bell&#39;s palsy and she does not know if she got this from the covid shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. on 02Feb2021, droop in her lip/mouth on 02Feb2021, her eye was still watering on 02Feb2021, there was a little puffing around the eye/ puffiness around her eye on 02Feb2021, double vision on an unspecified date, the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech on an unspecified date. Caller was calling about the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She said on Friday 29Jan2021 she had the first shot at about 12:30. Her eye started watering in the morning Thursday the day before and she maybe assumed she was getting a cold in her eye but it was really runny and she got the shot. She was a cancer patient on chemo and she went to the doctor because she was supposed to get her chemo. That Tuesday morning she had a droopy lip on the right side and her eye was still watering, there was a little puffing around the eye and the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech so she thought stroke but she was going to get her chemo in an hour or 2 so she when they checked her she told them what happened, she was seeing the PA that day so she left and came back 10 minutes later and said she had talked to the doctor, they were not going to give chemo today and told her she had Bell&#39;s Palsy and she does not know if she got this from the COVID shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. This was her first shot so as a cancer patient on chemo should be getting the second shot 21Feb. She was concerned about taking that when she already has Bell&#39;s Palsy now, what else would it cause and then if she does not get it would she be 50 % protected. The doctor seemed to say she thought it was from the vaccine, but caller does not know because the eye watering began the day or 2 prior to getting the vaccine. Product details: She does not have the vaccine card right with her and she was using a walker to get up and down and so she was not able to provide NDC lot expiration right now. It would be available if needed at a later time. Indication: doctor said she should have it because she has no immune system. They don&#39;t know what to do they are just following what they told her and they were scared to death. The caller states she was a cancer patient on chemotherapy. She received her first Pfizer COVID-19 injection on Friday, 29Jan2021. Prior to the vaccine, her eye had been watering Thursday or Friday morning before she had shot, it was just her right eye. On Tuesday, 02Feb2021, she developed a droop in her mouth and puffiness around her eye and so forth. Caller clarified it was just on the right side and with her right eye. She also has double vision in her right eye. She got up in the morning on 02Feb2021, and her husband was in the other room and told her that she sounded funny. She explained to her husband her mouth was dry and she was kind of slurring her speech. Her husband came into the room she was in and said, &#34;huh, your lip was drooping&#34;. Since it was in the morning and she had no other symptoms besides the talking funny and the puffiness around her eye, she didn&#39;t take it as a stroke. She figured she would just until she went to her chemotherapy appointment she had the same day, 02Feb2021. She went into her appointment and showed the person and gave her information on what happened. The person wanted an MRI of the brain to make sure she didn&#39;t have cancer there or cancer anywhere else up in that area and also that she didn&#39;t have a stroke. She confirms the MRI was fine, both were negative for any signs of this. She was told she developed bell&#39;s palsy. She has a drooping lip. The caller was concerned about her second shot. She wants to know should she getting the second vaccine, because the person at the (institution name) office (where she receives her chemotherapy) believes the bell&#39;s palsy came from the COVID-19 vaccine. She was supposed to have chemotherapy that day (02Feb2021), but they wouldn&#39;t give it to her then, but she did have it done yesterday. Caller explains she has no NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the chemotherapy she receives. She isn&#39;t given any stuff with any numbers and she gets numerous medications. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination): Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine because as she was sitting waiting to receive her injection, she remembers wiping her eye and thinking to herself, &#34;I wish this eye would quit watering&#34;. Caller states she had a fever blister, but she was not quite sure about when this appeared. She doesn&#39;t know if she had developed the fever blister before or the next day after receiving the vaccine, she was not quite sure. The any events were not required a visit to Emergency Room. She went to the Oncology Office for her chemotherapy appointment. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Caller had the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on 02Feb2021 showed she didn&#39;t have a stroke and no cancer of the brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: negative on 02Feb2021 Negative for stroke and/or cancer. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                I have osteoarthritis, with Heberden&#39;s nodes on all of my fingers.   3 days ago the two nodes on the most affected finger (and the first that showed the arthritis) turned bright red.  Now the whole joint is red and a few of the other nodes have turned red.    Except for binding the first finger with the hope it would help (it didn&#39;t), I&#39;m not treating them, since of course one can&#39;t do anything about osteoarthritis except ease the pain.

A 78-years-old female patient receive first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) on 15Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID Prevention. Medical history included ongoing High Blood Pressure, she was diagnosed approximately 5 years prior to starting blood pressure medications in 1998. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) at 320mg/12.5mg, once daily, by mouth from 1998 and ongoing, amlodipine besylate at 5mg, once daily, by mouth at night from 1998, both for High blood pressure. The patient stated that she did not realize, but she must have been exposed to the COVID Virus, prior to getting her shot. She stated that on 15Jan2021, she went and got her Pfizer COVID shot, and that same day, by the time she got home, she was starting to feel bad and it went downhill from there. She mentioned that on the same day on 15Jan2021, she &#34;came down with covid&#34;. She finally went in on 22Jan2021, and got tested, and she did test positive for COVID. The patient was tested Positive for COVID-19 on 22Jan2021. She did believe she was getting better. On 29Jan2021, she felt fairly decent, and today, she is kind of weak but she is assuming that will happen. She was scheduled to go back for her second dose on 08Feb2021, and she is wondering if there are recommendations about the second dose, for people who tested positive for COVID after having gotten the first dose. When queried for her PCP contact information, she stated that her head is not working really great and she feels stupid she did not have this information handy to provide. She states that the first week with her symptoms, she just figured she did have the virus. She had a cough but it never got down to where she had trouble breathing, and she just figured that her body had to go through, whatever it was going to go through, and as long as the patient felt like she was okay, there was not anything anyone could do, she just had to play it out. When she did finally go get tested, the doctor told her to get on Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what the patient has been taking, and she feels like it has helped a lot. Before she saw the doctor, she was taking Acetaminophen, but the doctor told her to do the Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what she has been doing. By the time she got home from getting her vaccine, her heart was racing. She took her blood pressure and it was okay at 125/73, and her heart rate was 72. She has high blood pressure and she takes two medications for that, so she took her night time blood pressure pill and the fast beating of her heart went away. The next day, she got to aching. She has had all different aches, and she ran a fever that got up to 101, and the rest of the time it was 100 or 99, but the fevers were not all day long, they would just come and go. Now she has had no fever in four or more days, and she is doing better. She does still have the cough, but she also has allergies so she does not know what is causing the cough. As far as the reaction to the vaccine, just her arm got sore. But she thinks she was exposed prior to getting the vaccine and just did not know it. she stated that the people took her temperature the day of the shot and she didn&#39;t have a temperature. She did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of fever was recovering, of cough and allergies was not recovered, of her heart was racing was recovered.

                                                I was vaccinated with Pfizer for the first time 11 days ago. Within a few minutes of being vaccinated, I felt nauseated but I did NOT throw up. I have been sick ever since with one thing and another. For the first several days after being vaccinated, I had a sore arm, which I expected. I have also experienced extreme fatigue, chills, nausea, muscle and joint aches, a sore throat (briefly), an occasional headache, tenderness in my left armpit and along the left side of my rib cage, stomach pain and diarrhea and at times, a low-grade fever and sweating. My memory and ability to focus on my work have been affected. Yesterday (March 13), I felt OK all day and thought I was better at last, but after I ate dinner, I vomited and had diarrhea. I told my primary care physician about all of this in an email and she replied that my symptoms were &#34;normal.&#34; I&#39;m not so sure. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else feeling so sick for so long after the first dose of Pfizer.

She doesn&#39;t have a heart problem she doesn&#39;t have any other medical issues. She&#39;s not diabetic the neuropathy was idiopathic.  Concomitant medications included atorvastatin for cholesterol (abnormal), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA). The patient previously took morphine and was allergic, and hallucinating as she was told by the nurse, she said there were monkeys on the ceiling and her husband was trying to kill her and gets itchy with morphine. This is the same reaction she had when found out she had the reaction to NSAIDs, for example, she could take Advil or Tylenol for one night but it she took it two nights, that was when she woke up itching all over. She reports no rash, just itch. It just lasted that one night and it was gone. She could take some Advil and get that itchy feeling.

She&#39;s been isolating since Feb2020. She was only going out for necessity. She took a risk and had family at her home for Christmas. She hasn&#39;t been to church in almost a year, so she was taking this very seriously. Before they even started telling you to wear a mask she was listening to the news in December and January. She states, alright she&#39;s isolating, it&#39;s the safest thing she can do she&#39;s not ready to leave this world yet even knowing she&#39;s past her golden years. Her doctor put her on Atorvastatin it because of her age, she had blood drawn but she wasn&#39;t given any counts on an unspecified date. Her first thought was she had a chest problem but it&#39;s not a heart attack, the ache doesn&#39;t go any farther than what she told. It&#39;s not stopping her from being productive, from doing things. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room, physician office and was not hospitalized.

                                                I had the second Covid (Pfizer) vaccine on February 22. The next day I had chills, fever, aches, nausea and was very weak. After about 30 hours I felt okay again.  However, a week and a half later, I noticed red bumps on the back of my neck. The next day, my neck and scalp had red, itchy blotches. Through the next five days, these spread down my body to my ankles until I was covered with the red, very itchy blotches. I did go to Urgent Care on the third day and I was given a 5-day prescription of Prednisone. It did not do much until the third day and then it relieved the itching somewhat for about 6 hours, but then it would start again. After the five days of Prednisone, I took Benedryl for three days until the itch and redness disappeared.  I checked the facility web site on types of rashes and my rash fits the description (and the photo) of a drug-related rash, but I have not changed or added any drugs for several years other than the Covid vaccine (I did some research online and found two other people who have had the same problems I have had after the second Covid vaccine. Both of them had the typical reaction of chills, fever, aches and dizziness for about a day after the second shot and then 1-2 weeks later, broke out in a rash. Both reported having the rash start at the neck or head and then spreading down the body throughout one to two weeks before disappearing. There were photos on the facility site of drug-related rashes and they were exactly like what I had.  Since the rash was almost certainly covid vaccine related, I am making this report, which my doctor recommended. I had no other changes in diet, medications, environment, etc. ? only the Pfizer vaccine was new to my body.

A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, second dose on 10mar2021 (formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EIV6202) via an unspecified route of administration at single dose for covid 19 immunisation. The patient medical history included ongoing tubular dysfunction, migraine and patient had the vestibular Dysfunction from 40 years, ongoing migraine headache. The patient historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EL9267), (first dose) via an unspecified route of administration on 17feb2021 at single dose for covid 19 immunisation and took Flu shot for immunization. The patient had regular flu shot a few years ago it was mentioned that doctor told get a Benadryl an hour before my shot which I did and she was in the hospital for 5 hours on a Breathing machine. Concomitant medications included rizatriptan benzoate (MAXALT) at 10 mg, as needed for migraine. Consumer stated, &#34;I had Tubular Dysfunction been diagnosed many years ago and I live with dizzy every day In Mar2021. I have tried everything to get rid of it and nothing is working. This is going on for Probably 40 years may be more anyway (Intent: History). I had my second vaccine on 10Mar2021 and on the first day, my doctor told me since I had the reaction to the regular Flu shot a few years ago my doctor told me get a Benadryl an hour before my shot which I did and the first day everything was wonderful. I was so happy you know no reaction, I didn&#39;t have any. The first time I got the flu shot I was in the hospital for 5 hours on a Breathing machine, it was beautiful. I thought I was free and then the next day my arm got real sore and I expected that and I expected to have a fever I expected to feel nauseous and all but the dizziness set in and just got progressively worse and it will be a week tomorrow since the vaccine still I was dizzy In Mar2021. I have been so off-center In Mar2021. Sunday I could hardly do over I was just so sick with the dizziness and yesterday the same thing and this morning I thought I will get over maybe today will be a good day and it&#39;s the same. I called my neurologist and he said that any pre-existing condition can be exaggerated by the vaccine while the system is building up his anti-bodies so I expected but is this going to go away, this thing, is this going to go away and reported just so beside myself, I just can&#39;t live like this anymore everyday you know this is beyond dizzy.&#34; tried taking, I do have a prescription for it starts with M wait a minute it hasn&#39;t helped but I tried it , if it doesn&#39;t help for the first time I won&#39;t take it again but I have a prescription for Meclizine 25 mg Tablets. Consumer stated, &#34;I spoke to somebody earlier and told me to call this number and tell you that what&#39;s going with me. Tomorrow will be one week, since I had my second Covid shot and the first day, I got it everything was fine. The second day I was feeling a little off and I thought okay will they told me that I would feel little, may be not sick-sick but not feeling good and then the second day after that Friday. I got it on Wednesday and by Friday, I have a pre-existing condition and it is called Vestibular Dysfunction. Consumer stated, &#34;I had the Vestibular Dysfunction from 40 years. So, I live with dizzy all the time. But by Friday, it is just unbelievable dizzy, Saturday was worse, Sunday was even worse, yesterday was little bit better. Today, I am still shaking and dizzy and Tomorrow will be one week since I have the shot and I read that stuff happened in the first week and I was wondering, have you had the other people with the same problem, Consumer further added, &#34;It is not an inconvenience, this is horrible way to live. I feel dizzy all the time, this is horrible. Was I told that I should talk to you about, can the shot exacerbate a bad situation like this, they told me to call you, now I getting no help at all can anybody tell me.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Nothing I have no recollection of any of that no, I just started coughing and they told me to go to the emergency room so I did you know In Mar2021. The patient has received treatment with Meclizine 25 mg tablets. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

                                                The injection was given high up on my arm and was very painful.  About an hour after receiving the shot my arm felt weak and my hand and fingers felt numb.  I could not raise my arm.  This lasted into the next day, when my shoulder began to hurt. The feeling returned to my hand but I started getting drawing pains in my arm, and increasing pain in my arm when raising it.

This nurse (patient) reported that a 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6204) at the age of 78-years, via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 at single dose; first single dose of BNT162B2 (lot: EM9810) on 11Feb2021; both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoarthritis (having aches and pains) had for 20 years; large sliding hiatal hernia was diagnosed from an EGD six months before, didn&#39;t want surgery to fix it; heartburn (last five years); fatty liver, was not from drinking alcohol; generalized anxiety; was tuberculosis positive only because she was exposed years ago. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole started four to five years before at 40 mg twice a day for heartburn; escitalopram (tablet) been on for 15 years or longer at 10 mg 1 DF every day for generalized anxiety; clonazepam 0.5 mg nightly at bedtime for anxiety (been taking for last ten years or more, stops her from worrying about her kids and stuff like that). The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

Then she had the procedure on 3/25/21 and then 2 days later she lost the use of her legs.  She has fatigue, no energy whatsoever, it took 3 days for her to be able to get up and walk, and slept on the floor as she could not use her legs to get into the bed.

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 11:00, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included silent heart attack, ongoing Barrett&#39;s oesophagus from 2008, fall she had over two months (2021), eye surgery on an unknown date. She does not get any shots and can&#39;t have shots even for the flu shot because she had problems with two flu shots she had; states she had a problem with each one of the flu shots and does not know the names of the flu shots and has no lot numbers to provide for them; states she had the flu shots in the early 1990&#39;s and worked in healthcare and had to have them and they told her back then if she wanted to work she had to have the flu shots and then she got sick with both of the flu shots and they said they guessed they would not force her to have the flu shots. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose administered and then about 14 hours after (12Mar2021) that she had no problems until it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours. She does not know what to do about getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine and was at her cardiologist&#39;s this week and he said he is not familiar with the Pfizer vaccine causing chest pain; caller states she has a history of silent heart attacks. She still has tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight and they told her to mention if she does go for the second dose of the vaccine to mention that she had this situation.The chest pain and arm pain began 12Mar2021 and the arm pain is in her right arm where the vaccine was administered and the arm pain and chest pain have resolved; states the arm pain and chest pain stopped and she thinks that lasted about an hour and a half and she called a family member to take her to the hospital; states about 2:30am that same day she was admitted the morning of 12Mar2021 and was discharged on 13Mar2021. They ran every test known to the patient and for a while her blood pressure went up to 198/203 in the emergency room (12Mar2021) and she is not on any medication; caller states she does have Crestor but has not started on it and has not taken it yet. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight began the same time she was having the chest pain and she is not having any chest pain or anything like that right now but the tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight is still ongoing; states she did go get cardiac clearance to make sure which was this past week and she does not feel well and like for her the tiredness is bugging her. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing are better but she knows they are there and she tries to swallow something and is like boy her throat is still tight. They did an ultrasound in her left leg because she was limping from a fall she had over two months ago but still has a sore ankle from that and they sent her down for the ultrasound and a CT looking for blood clots in her lungs because she was short of breath (12Mar2021); caller states she thinks they were running everything they could to rule out things; states everything was negative for the CT and ultrasound and she believes the CT and ultrasound were done on 12Mar2021. She has no idea when she was diagnosed with silent heart attacks but they kept asking her about this when she went in for eye surgery and asked her when she had a heart attack and she said she had never had one and they said yes she had and she never knew. She just set up a HCP appointment after the reported events with a gastroenterologist because she has Barrett&#39;s and because of the esophagus she did not know if it flared up by the Pfizer vaccine and that caused the pain because the two pains of the heart and esophagus mimic each other with pain going up into the jaw so they were ruling out which one it was; states she went out as an atypical chest pain and called the cardiologist and went in and went over her records from the hospital with the cardiologist. She does not know what caused what in terms of the pain. The outcome of the event blood pressure increased was unknown, chest pain and pain in arm was recovered, other events was recovering.

A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Mar2021 12:10 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine on 23Feb2021 (lot number: EN6198 with expiry date 31May2021) for Covid-19 immunization. The patient experienced passed out for a very short period of  time and awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking on 18Mar2021; her body felt warm but then she was freezing, she was sick and was different and very weak, and muscles were sore in Mar2021. It was further reported that the patient got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine that day on 17Mar2021 and about 12:45am or 1:30am the next morning she was awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking; the shaking has resolved completely but she is not sure when it resolved but she was shaking for a good while because she can remember being so uncomfortable with her body moving so much which went on for maybe 20 minutes or so when her husband woke up.Patient&#39;s husband then woke up and got Ibuprofen and gave it to her and that stopped the shaking which surprised her and she did not know the Ibuprofen would work to stop the shaking that well and the Ibuprofen did work in stopping the shaking. The Ibuprofen stopped the shaking and she can remember to touch her body felt warm but then she was freezing and she does not know what this means but this was not ongoing and resolved when her husband gave her the ibuprofen and she stopped shaking right away which always amazed her that the Ibuprofen worked. She stated fortunately the Ibuprofen stopped her from shaking and she was able to sleep until early morning when she woke up and knew she was sick and was different and very weak; states the weakness was not ongoing and the approximate time the weakness resolved was unknown but she was down the rest of the day and after that she passed out for a very short period of  time and held her head up and stood up and thought wow something was going on and asked where was this coming from and it was not nausea but she was just weak. She has not passed out for a huge amount of time but fortunately she had some towels laying close by and was able to use a towel; states after that she stopped for the rest of the day and only got up to go to the potty and was just so weak and heard that from many people that they just slept afterwards.Caller states her muscles were sore and she realized that was just normal and after the 2nd dose of the vaccine she knew her muscles would probably be sore and this was resolved. She came downstairs and was sitting on a chair and then stood and no longer sat in the chair and her husband knew things were not right with her and her eyes looked funny and she passed out and that never happened to her before and she was passed out for a few moments. Other than the Ibuprofen she did not have treatment and did not go to the emergency room or the HCP office. Patient only took one Ibuprofen and she has a very small body and her husband sometimes takes 2-3 Ibuprofen and she thinks wow that is so many but she herself does not have any medication and she just took one Ibuprofen and it worked; She took the Ibuprofen on 18Mar2021 in the early morning. Fortunately she was in good health. Outcome of the event passed out for a very short period of  time, was awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking and muscles were sore was recovered in Mar2021, and unknown outcome for the remaining events.

After a month I called the dr. and  was told to take 2 naproxen twice a day to relive  swelling.  T his helped, but when I stopped the pain came back.  Does not hurt just sitting, only when I try to lift something.  Think injection was given in a muscle.  Hurts when I left arm above shoulder.

                                                Pneumonia after getting the COVID Vaccine; Pneumonia was related to MRSA; Very weak; mild fever; This is spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband). A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 78-years-old, administered in arm on 25Feb2021 15:45 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus from 2011 (Verbatim: Diabetic; Diagnosed 10 years ago), rheumatoid arthritis from 1995 (Verbatim: Rheumatoid arthritis; Diagnosed in 1995), cardiac failure congestive from Oct2020 (Verbatim: Congestive Heart Failure), adrenal insufficiency from 1990 (Verbatim: Adrenal insufficiency; Diagnosed in probably 1990), atrial fibrillation from 2017 (Verbatim: Atrial fibrillation; Diagnosed 4 years ago). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications (&#34;she takes lots of medications. Too long of list she probably takes 15 different medications, reporter chose not to provide them). No-other vaccines were given at the same time. She gets the flu vaccine every year, shingles vaccines, pneumonia vaccines every year but, has no idea where they were manufactured. Confirmed she did not get the listed vaccines at the same time she got the COVID Vaccine. The patient&#39;s husband and the patient (his wife) both received their 1st COVID shot on the 25Feb2021 and was scheduled for 3 weeks later. He got his COVID on the 18Mar2021. The patient got Pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital but he does not know the exact time the Pneumonia started. It developed over a period of several day started with a mild fever (in Mar2021) and after the 2nd or 3rd day her fever spiked and that&#39;s when she was admitted to the hospital. He reports his wife went into the hospital with Pneumonia on 18Mar2021, the day she was supposed to get the 2nd shot. It was also reported that Pneumonia was related to MRSA. She laid up in the hospital for 2 weeks, the weakness (&#34;very weak&#34;) may have happened in the hospital or a few days before, date was confirmed to be on 15Mar2021. The event &#34;pneumonia&#34; was totally unrelated to COVID and now she is in a nursing home, she went in on 26Mar2021. She probably won&#39;t be able to have the 2nd shot for a couple of weeks. She was in there for a couple of weeks and still quarantined. He wanted to know will the fact that she is not getting the 2nd shot at the 3-week interval reduce the efficacy of the vaccine since she is getting the 2nd dose late. Does it make a difference with the effectiveness of the vaccine if she&#39;s going take the 2nd dose 3-4 weeks or even a month and a half rather than the usual 21 days interval? No treatment before going to the hospital other than calling the doctor and the doctor saying take her to the hospital (not reported if patient received treatment during hospital stay). No treatment done over the weekend, while she was in the nursing home. The adverse event pneumonia required a visit to Emergency Room. The patient was hospitalized from 18Mar2021 to 26Mar2021. Investigations included had a lot of blood work done, a CT scan, an X-ray on unspecified dates. He does not have any of the results but, the physicians have them. The outcome of the event mild fever was unknown, for very weak was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovered on 26Mar2021.

A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 78 years, administered in right bicep on 16Mar2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history includes bells palsy from 1997, lower right lobe of her lung removed in 2016, and removed for carcinoid tumor on an unspecified date. Patient did not have prior vaccinations in 4 weeks. Concomitant medications were none. There were no other vaccines administered on the same date as the suspect. Patient previously too quite a few medications but she hasn&#39;t been taking for years or that would affect it. It was reported that patient and the reporter received first dose on 16Mar2021 at 09:00 AM in the right bicep as recommended by the pulmonologist and oncologist.  It was reported that on 29Mar2021, also reported as &#34;13 days later from vaccination&#34;, facial paralysis started around noon. At the time of report, patient was experiencing Bell&#39;s Palsy from 29Mar2021 and asking for recommendation for second dose. Patient was also officially diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy when she went to the ER on 31Mar2021. Patient has seen the doctor and been to the ER and the doctor refused to comment saying he had no opinion, they had asked him if she should do the second dose and he said he had no opinion. Reporter relayed that on the website there is no specific notable balance in the numerical groups to suggest a causal relationship to the vaccine. Reporter was asking if the second dose was prohibited, stating patient was scheduled for 06Apr2021 which is 21 days after her first dose. Patient&#39;s husband spoke from the FDA&#39;s briefing document that &#34;Bell&#39;s palsy was reported by four vaccine participants and none in the placebo group. These cases occurred at 3, 9, 37, and 48 days after vaccination,&#34; and mentioned that  there have been 4 reports of Bell&#39;s Palsy during the study and 1 of those was after the first dose and 3 were after the second dose. They wanted to know if it is allowed should she get it or could it be rescheduled to a later date. For tests, no testing was done they just did a visual exam on an unspecified date. Vaccine was not administered at Facility. The outcome was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number is requested.

                                                Loss of voice; Asthma; her voice became extremely hoarse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Family history included sore arm. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate, vilanterol trifenatate (BREO ELLIPTA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 (lot number: EN6198) on 23Feb2021 in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. About 3-4 days after (as reported), her voice became extremely hoarse, in which she lost a voice for 3 weeks. She mentioned that she was diagnosed with Asthma on 23Mar2021 and was started with a Breo Ellipta inhaler. The Breo had a listed side effect of hoarseness of voice in which she started a week after receiving the vaccine, to which her hoarseness became worse. She mentioned that according to the paperwork she received from Pfizer, hoarseness of the voice was also listed as a side effect. She consulted with her Pulmonologist who determined that the inhaler was working pretty well and would like to continue her on it and wanted to see if the hoarseness is still there by May. As of calling, she already has some of her voice back, but the hoarseness was still continuing, which gets worse in the afternoon or evening. She would like to know if this has been reported and for how long it will last. She had the injection/vaccine and hoarseness started about a week before she started on the Breo Ellipta inhaler (NDC: 01730859-10 Lot: UL4F Expiration: 10/2022 Dose: 100mcg/25mcg). She stated they both can cause the same thing with hoarseness. She clarified that when she lost her voice, it was just above a whisper. It had gotten progressively worse since it started a week prior. It lasted almost 3 weeks. Now she has started to get her voice back, but still has the hoarseness and this was as good as her voice gets, it gets worse in the afternoon and by 2:00 P.M. it was back down to no voice. She went down to see the pulmonary specialist and prescribed her 2 different inhalers. The specialist said it was an unusual hoarseness, but he couldn&#39;t tell what one it was from. The patient clarified she experienced the hoarseness first from the Pfizer Covid Vaccine after the second vaccine, and then a week later she started on the Breo Ellipta, and the hoarseness got worse. The doctor wants to wait until 19May2021 and see if she still has the hoarseness and then he might switch, but it was working so well, he didn&#39;t want to switch her yet. The patient was prescribed Breo Ellipta and Albuterol but she hasn&#39;t used the Albuterol. The patient reported that she considers the event as medically significant because hoarseness can cause cancer and she doesn&#39;t want it to get worse. No other vaccines administered on the same date of the BNT162B2 and no prior vaccination. The event hoarseness started on 18Mar2021 and loss of voice on 23Mar2021. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room. The outcome of the event hoarseness was not recovered, Loss of voice recovered on 13Apr2021 and asthma was unknown. The events hoarseness and loss of voice was reported as serious-medically significant.  Follow attempts are possible. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Hoarse voice and Loss of voice cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history included type 2 diabetes that diagnosed about 3 years ago, this year makes 4 years, and she took medications for it. And she was a little overweight, supposed to drop some but gained some back that because of diabetes. Historical Vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) also at age of 78-years, at single dose in left arm on 02Feb2021 13:00 for covid-19 immunisation and she had no problem with that one. Another Historical Vaccine included flu shots, it just lasted a day or two, maybe that&#39;s it, never had problems before. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported side effects from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Her arm was still bothering her. There was a lump down from where the injection site was and that she kept rubbing it but it won&#39;t go away and that she still had pain. She was told she should go to the doctor, but she thought she would call to see what was best to do. She had not a fever, just the lump on the arm, 4 inches down from the shoulder where she got the shot. The patient stated that both Pfizer COVID vaccines were in her left arm, she should have gotten it in the other arm. The patient stated she heard about blood clots and thought she&#39;d better check it out. The patient stated that she had the lump and her shoulder aches; not the shoulder the upper arm. The lump was on the inside and she kept rubbing it but it didn&#39;t go away. The patient had the second Pfizer COVID vaccine in the morning around 10:00 AM on 3Mar2021.

The patient stated the lump felt like it was the size of a nickel, she was pushing to try to feel it and that maybe the lump was a little larger than a nickel. Her shoulder aches and the feeling went into the arm and it started the same week she had the shot but that she didn&#39;t pay any attention so is not sure exactly when it started. It was best to check it out with her doctor. The outcome for event pain and vaccination site lump was not recovered, while for remains event was unknown.

                                                nurse was putting it in the wrong spot because it hurt so bad; pain in left arm; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EM9809; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on Left arm on 07Feb2021 14:10 as 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery from 2013; Back problems, had brain surgery when she was 39 and she still has ongoing disability from that. Patient stated that born with the disability in her right hand and a cyst, they just didn&#39;t find the cyst until she was 39 and that&#39;s when she had the surgery. Family history was reported as none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication was unspecified allergy shots, once a week and ongoing. The patient historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL1283, Expiry date: 30Apr2021) on 17Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that, the patient has gotten both shots and she didn&#39;t have any problems with the medication, but she had a problem with the 2nd shot, so she was calling for advice. States that she got her 2nd shot on Sunday, and the nurse either stuck it into a nerve or into the muscle because she felt like her arm was going to fall off before the nurse even pushed in the medicine; states that she wanted to scream. Now she was still having pain in that arm, but it&#39;s not exactly where the shot was, it&#39;s running down her arm and it&#39;s not constant, it comes and goes. States that she did have rotator cuff surgery in 2013, and that&#39;s kind of what the pain feels like now. This is in her left arm, which was the only arm that she can really use, because she had brain surgery when she was 39 and she still has a disability from that. Clarifies that she was born with the disability with her right hand and a cyst, they just didn&#39;t find the cyst until she was 39 and that&#39;s when she had the surgery. States that it scares her because she only has the use of one arm already. She had no problem with the medication in the vaccine either time. States that the second time she got the vaccine, she knew that the nurse was putting it in the wrong spot because it hurt so bad, like so bad that she wanted to slap her. States that the pain is nowhere near like it was on Monday, but she didn&#39;t know who to call. She gives herself allergy shots, so she knows how to give herself injections. States that the vaccine was perfect, she had no side effects from that. The first shot, she didn&#39;t even know that she had gotten a shot. States that yesterday her arm didn&#39;t feel as bad as it does today. It&#39;s more aggravating. Again, states that the pain was like what she had after her rotator cuff surgery. States that she hasn&#39;t felt that pain since her surgery, then on Sunday when she got the shot the pain has kind of started back up. States that it has definitely improved. On Monday and Tuesday, she would feel a little twinge of pain about every 3-4 hours, but today it&#39;s every 10-15 minutes. The patient not visited emergency room and not visited physician office. The outcome of the event pain in left arm was recovering and was unknown for another event.

                                                her tongue felt burned; her mouth was burning; her throat was burning; acid reflux; everything was still burning; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information Team. A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 78-years-old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included macular degeneration. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included tetanus vaccine on an unspecified date for immunisation. She got her first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine on 25Feb2021 and thought she was having a reaction. She called her doctor and he said go get some Benadryl to make sure your throat doesn&#39;t get swollen. She went out and bought Benadryl and she took the Benadryl every six hours. Her doctor said don&#39;t get the second dose of the Covid 19 vaccine because these side effects she had are a warning and the second dose might not be helpful for her. The patient reported that she stayed at the facility that gave her the Covid 19 vaccine for 20 minutes and her husband was waiting for her. When she was driving away from the facility her tongue felt burned and then her mouth was burning and then her throat was burning on an unspecified date. She does have acid reflux but this wasn&#39;t like any acid reflux she&#39;s ever had. She got home and she drank some cool water but everything was still burning. By then it was almost supper time so she took 20 mg of Pepcid. Her mouth burned throughout her meal. She called her doctor again and he asked her if her mouth was swollen and she told him she didn&#39;t know. She took more Benadryl. One of her daughter&#39;s told her that the Covid 19 virus was so bad that she should get her second dose of the Covid 19 vaccine no matter how bad her reaction was. Her doctor told her not to get the second Covid 19 vaccine. She assumed it was a done deal. She wasn&#39;t going to get the second dose. She was supposed to get her second dose on 17Mar2021. She had gone to the doctor a couple times and each time he told her, do not get the second Covid 19 vaccine. He showed her the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine print out with side effects. When her mouth started burning after she got the first Covid 19 vaccine her husband did ask her if she wanted to turn around and go back to the facility where she got the vaccine but she told him no. Now she&#39;s missed her second Covid 19 vaccine on 17Mar2021 because she thought that what her doctor told her was the final word. She was afraid to get the second Covid 19 vaccine and she wants to listen to her doctor because he knows what&#39;s best. During this Covid 19 virus time she was also diagnosed with Macular Degeneration. That&#39;s keeping her from driving and she&#39;s lost even more of her independence. She&#39;s heard if she gets the Covid 19 virus it can attack her eyes. Every time she hears the words fully vaccinated it makes her want to cry. She&#39;s worried that people won&#39;t want to be near her because she&#39;s not fully vaccinated. Her husband had both of his Covid 19 vaccines and he had no side effects. Her husband gets every vaccine on the market and never has any side effects. As far as she&#39;s concerned she feels like a pariah because no one will want to be around her because she&#39;s not fully vaccinated. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (02Jun2021): No follow-up attempts are completed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 79-year-old elderly female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Apr2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On unspecified date the patient experienced, the patient could not catch her breath, her breathing was down in the danger zone at 220 reported dyspnoea and hospitalization on an unspecified date, had high blood pressure, her doctor could see that she had some pneumonia showing, coughing, soreness in her arm, slept all day long. Additional Context: Consumer states that her doctor wanted her to call and report this, because she has asthma and allergies that are chronic. Consumer states that she took her first Pfizer injection in April. She saw her allergy specialist on the 1st, and she tested the Consumer before she took the vaccine. She states that her breathing was at 113% breathing capacity (good) and the allergy specialist wanted her to go ahead and get the injection, which the Consumer did. Consumer clarifies that she received the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 11Apr2021 and that she did really good with that one. Consumer then received the second COVID vaccine on 13May2021. She came home and slept almost all night long and thought she was okay. The Consumer explains she was not feeling real good before she went to receive her second dose. It was kind of like she was having some coughing and stuff, but she thought it was not bad and that she could still go ahead and get it. She went ahead on 13May2021 and had the second dose. Consumer states that on the first day, she slept all day long- the whole entire day, she didn&#39;t even wake up. On the second day, the Consumer states that she had soreness in her arm. Then, she noticed she was getting really sick and started running a 99.9 temperature. It was getting worse day by day, and she kept coughing and getting worse. Then, on 18May2021, her husband took her to the emergency room and they just automatically treated her for asthma and allergy and sent her home. This was on Tuesday night. On Thursday night, she got so bad that her breathing was down in the danger zone at 220. She couldn&#39;t breathe. Her husband rushed her back to the ER and this time, they kept the Consumer and hospitalized her for a week. Her blood pressure was high. She clarifies normally her breathing on her peak flow meter, she can always do from 350-400. Well on Thursday night, her peak flow was all the way down to 220 and she could not catch her breath. Consumer states that she was admitted to the hospital and they had her on oxygen and blood pressure medication. She states that they did a bronch on her and still did not really come to a conclusion of what was happening. She was told it looked like it could be an infection in her lungs. Consumer states that she is having to see three doctors this week because of this since she got out of the hospital. She saw her medical doctor, Dr., yesterday who was very concerned because she had a recent patient that was about the same age as the Consumer- he was 75 years old. This patient had done the same thing, only he ended up taking pneumonia and dying with it. The doctor told the Consumer in her x-ray, her doctor could see that she had some pneumonia showing. The Consumer asked her doctor while she was in the hospital about the pneumonia and they refused to listen to anything the Consumer said, so Dr. told her that the Consumer needed to report this because she is still so sick. Consumer clarifies that she was hospitalized for a week and that she just got out on Saturday, 29May2021. While reporting the event details, the Consumer stated that she had and emergency call coming through and that she had to take it. Consumer had to end the call, stating she had to go and requested this call handler call her back. The patient was hospitalized due to events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 99.9, peak expiratory flow rate: 220 Units: x-ray: had pneumonia showing. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She was prompted to consult because of &#34;pain in the shoulder&#34; she said it hurt when she takes a deep breath (lasted for days), pain radiated around my breast in the front. Her shoulder wasn&#39;t hurting that bad, but it was still there until Friday. The pain was in her shoulder blade and it went to the front near her breast. She went to the chiropractor on friday, and he said he thought it was from the vaccine. Upon checking up with Doctor with an x-ray, Doctor confirmed that he couldn&#39;t see anything; nothing to indicate pericarditis. In addition to this, she mentioned that the nurse practitioner also experienced the toe pains (Age and Gender not provided). On the next day on 03Jun2021, she set an appointment with her chiropractor, and confirmed these side effects were from the vaccine. It was reported that age at time of onset of reaction/event was 78. Does the caller wait to a take the vaccine. Does the caller not even take the second dose. Her hip hurting was like a jab. Her foot pain woke her up in the middle of the night. She received her first dose on 27May2021. She was scheduled for her second dose on 16Jun2021. She was worried and has her reservations about getting the second dose because she had a reaction. She asked if it would make a difference to wait for getting the second shot; &#34;is it better if I wait between vaccine one and two&#34; She has heard that people get adverse events after the second dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal on the same week that she received the shot on an unspecified date in 2021, the nurse practitioner said the chest x-ray was unremarkable and x-ray: normal on an unspecified date in 2021. Reporter seriousness for events was unspecified. The outcome of the event had tingling on the lips was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021 and for Felt like I got stabbed in the butt/hip and butt was hurting, Hip joint was hurting, arms hurting/arm was really sore was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

                                                Flu like symptoms; Headache; Aches and pains; Sore arm; lower lip broke out with cold sores; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0186, Expiration date and NDC number are unknown, time the vaccination was given: Noon), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 03Jun2021 at the age of 78-years-old as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient s medical history including any illness at time of vaccination were osteopenia, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, diagnosed over 20 years ago in 2001. The patient s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of historical vaccine, bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0186, Expiration date and NDC number are unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 13May2021 at the age of 78-years-old for covid-19 immunisation. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) if applicable, list any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine were none. Adverse events following prior vaccinations were none. Family medical history relevant to adverse events were none. Relevant tests were none. History of all previous immunization with the pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) were none. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect were none. It was reported that event happened after the second dose of the vaccine. About a week after receiving the second dose, her lower lip broke out with cold sores on an unspecified date in Jun2021 and she has been fighting this more than a week now. She tried Zovirax (NDC and lot unknown, expiration date 31Mar2021) which usually helps with this but it did not this time. It has been years since this has happened. Yes, this has happened to some other people. It has been two weeks now. The Zovirax tamped it down a little but did not get rid of it like it normally does. She thinks her immune system is working and her immune system is causing the issue. It was reported that she had the normal flu like symptoms and headache on 04Jun2021 and it went away in under three days, she thought it was normal. The caller also had a sore arm on 03Jun2021 and aches and pains on 04Jun2021. By the fourth day the caller was fine. The caller wanted to make Pfizer aware that someone else had the herpes complex problem. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. It was reported that age at time of onset of reaction/event was 78. Time of onset of adverse events was unknown. There was no investigation assessment. It was reported that she is tired of lock down and she does not want to wear a mask the rest of your life. She googled to see if anyone else had this come up and it seems to be a minor amount of people that have experienced it. She didnt expect for this to happen to her. The reporter assessed events as non-serious. The reporter assessed events relatedness to Pfizer covid vaccine as Related. The outcome of event, lower lip broke out with cold sores was not recovered while for other events was recovered on an unspecified date in Jun2021.  Additional information is requested.

                                                I had itchiness and swelling around my eye. I thought it was a bug bite but it kept getting worse. Eventually, I had a rash around my eyes, my forehead, my hair. I went to the urgent care where they prescribed me an antiviral. The antiviral seems to be slowing things down. I am also now experiencing a crawling sensation throughout my body. It feels as if a bug crawling on me. This is something new that I have never experienced before.

She went to her PCP and he told her that she had an infection from the Covid shot, and gave her some antibiotics and some prednisone.  This did not help.   She was able to walk with her rolling walker before but since then she has had this problem.  Her hands hurt, burn, turn red.  She drops things steadily.  When she gets up in the morning she is not able to do much as she drops things.  She still has the same symptoms, and still having no energy and not herself.  Her son has now moved in with her to help her as she is not able to take care of herself anymore.

Home in a week, back to normal (taking anti-seizure med) by second week. Hospital said seizure was due to alcohol withdrawal, which is ridiculous. Furlong did not stop drinking before the seizure. He was told to stop drinking afterward, which he did with no problems whatsoever.  Then went to PCP, neurologist, and cardiologist. Multiple tests, but still no cause for seizure found.

This is report 1 of 5.  A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: not reported), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28May2021 at 17:30 as single for covid-19 immunization (at the age of 78years). The patient medical history included First serious fall from May2021 to an unknown date-Shattered left hip that was May2019; shattered left hand and wrist; When shattered left hip they had to fix the shattered hip then they put a metal rod from the hip to the kneecap inside the femur bone. Second serious fall from 27Nov2019 to 27Nov2019, fell again in her home and that time she shattered the left knee, hip fracture- Broke right hip 4 or 5 times, shoulder arthroplasty- On the right arm. She broke that right before get to the shoulder, the upper arm and the shoulder and everything was all mangled, stevens-johnson syndrome from on an unspecified date in 1954 and ongoing-very severe autoimmune disease she got at age of 12, in roughly 1954. It is also called Erythema bullosum-that&#39;s what it starts out as-then becomes Stevens-Johnson Disease, then Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Affects mucus membranes in body and appears to be rejecting the eyes-this is relative to her blindness. When contracted had 108 degree fever, implantable defibrillator insertion from on an unspecified date in 2015 and ongoing- installed back about 6 years. She was taking some kind of, the numbers are way down now, she does not think there&#39;s a problem but they were thinking she was prediabetic which was probably attributed to her diet. The day before they did the blood test she had ice cream for lunch and for dinner. Then she had the blood test taken the next morning which could have set the numbers off the chart; since then the numbers have gone down. glucose tolerance impaired. They were thinking she was prediabetic and blind from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, wheelchair user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. She only has 1 eye now-left eye; has been legally blind since age 24 years; now left eye is just about gone. She was the 5th person in the world to have Stevens-Johnson syndrome with blindness that could still see and lived. First 3 people with Stevens-Johnson syndrome died-4th lived but was blind. Concomitant medication&#39;s included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), diazepam (VALIUM), hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN), cholesterol (CHOLESTEROL) taken for an unspecified indication and Unknown product: Some kind of stomach pill, does not know, it is the size of caraway seed in rye bread. Regarding concomitant medications caller reported she has no idea. She is taking products that the drug store puts a bubble pack for her. She was taking high blood pressure but her blood pressure was never high, it always ran on the low side; but they started giving her that when she had a pacemaker and defibrillator 2-in-1 installed back about 6 years ago. Otherwise unknown. Cholesterol meds but those numbers are all under control. She has been having trouble; so she thinks this is the last months she is getting her meds after that she thinks she is stopping everything. There&#39;s 5 or 6 meds in the morning and 2 at night, one is cholesterol from #. She cannot provide further information for her concomitant products as she is blind-Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Not provided, She cannot provide further information for her concomitant products as she is blind. With the old flu vaccines with the live viruses she was always coming down with the flu after getting the injections. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the COVID vaccine and since the vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient did not visit emergency room or physician office. Adverse reaction was very bad: Started out with pretty bad headache around noontime, 12:00 on 29May2021 with the most severe part of event starting probably about 22:00. From there it went to severe chills and temperature. Then she went to move her left arm where she had gotten the shot and couldn&#39;t move it; she tried to move her fingers and make a fist but couldn&#39;t do it; the arm was paralyzed. Then her shoulder blades started hurting like hell, like incredible. If she had a gun she would have put it to her head. Then where the neck connects to the body, collar bones she guessed; in between like if she had an adam&#39;s apple it would be on both sides of those bones that are right beside the neck, they started hurting like hell. The paralyzed arm the pain coming from that was incredible; then the pain went down to both hips and her back too; but back wasn&#39;t as severe as the bones. All of Saturday, 29May2021 into Sunday, 30May2021 she was unable to get out of bed. This whole thing just intensified, she had nobody there; she lives in senior housing, they are confined to their quarters, to their apartments, the whole thing. She did not have access to anyone, had problems with her phone with no dial tone, nothing. Finally on Sunday, 30May2021 early evening she was able to, she would say, slither out of bed on her back and drop her feet over the edge of the mattress so those are kind of like on the floor. Her wheelchair is next to her; she has to get her upper body upright to be in seated position to be able to get into the wheelchair which was damn near impossible to do. She never knew that kind of pain existed. She was then able to get into the bathroom and use that. She had nothing to drink because obviously if you drink have to urinate and use the bathroom there was no way she was going to go through that again. She thought at that time she might as well go and unlock the door so if an ambulance does come they can haul her to the hospital or they could retrieve her body. She was totally convinced she was going to die on Sunday night into Monday morning, 30May2021-31May2021. She was up until 04:30 on Monday morning, 31May2021 because she was so scared if she fell asleep she would pass away in her sleep. The pain she could not describe how bad that was. That was Monday morning, 31May2021, all of this interim information she is discussing here; basically she was a total mess until it started backing off on Wednesday, 02Jun2021. She was told by the commission for the blind, that they were able to set up the appointment with # because she was due for in-home inoculation with J&amp;J but when they had trouble with that it was pulled and the appointments were cancelled. The commission for the blind took it upon themselves to set up appointment for her Pfizer Covid Vaccine which was given at # on 8 #. #-that was where her Pfizer Covid Vaccine was administered. She did not call anyone or go to the doctor, emergency room or hospital; she has life alert but thought it was in God&#39;s hands so if he takes her he takes her. She did not call her daughter. She did call her doctor the early part of last week; he wants her to have a blood test to check for antibodies to see how much of the vaccine is in her or how much she is covered. Once he sees those numbers he says maybe she should get the J&amp;J Covid Vaccine, but if she already got the Pfizer Covid Vaccine and with the J&amp;J trouble with that too, that does not even make sense. She asked for information about that. She was due for a physical about a week ago but her daughter was unable to take her to her physical appointment because she had to take granddaughter to hospital because granddaughter has a hole in her heart and they had to do some testing on her. The patient underwent lab test which included body temperature of 108 degree on 29May2021. The outcome of events were unknown.  Information about lot/Batch has been requested.

The pain got worse to where I couldn&#39;t walk on it. The pain went up my leg to my knees. The next day, I went to the Ortho Indi facility. They did an x-ray on me that indicated that there was no structural damage to cause pain. The doctor recommended me to put on a boot that go up to my knees and to ice it. I did that from Wednesday through Sunday. The pain went away. Every now and then I would get a sharp pain in my left foot, but then it goes away.

A female patient of an unspecified age received BNT162b2 (CONMINTARY, Solution for injection, Lot No: EN6200), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 28-JAN-2021 16:00 as 1stdose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received second dose BNT162b2 (CONMINTARY, Solution for injection, Lot No: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 05-MAR-2021 16:00 as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing cardiac disorder heart condition , ongoing hypertension high blood pressure , cardiac operation from 25Jan2020 to 25Jan2020 heart surgery , knee arthroplasty from Jan2014 to an unknown date double knee replacement surgery made out of unknown titanium and plastic , office visit from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing foot doctor appointment , biopsy uterus from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing scheduled for a biopsy on her uterus , breast cancer from Sep2020 to an unknown date breast cancer , arthritis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing arthritis , immunisation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing very active , genetic counselling from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing genetic testing relative for breast cancer, heart surgery for other conditions was 2 heart stents placed, double knee replacement surgery was the prosthetics are each 9 inches made out of unknown titanium and plastic. Caller interchangeably referred to surgical date as Jan2014 and about 5 years ago. She was fine without any assistance for about 4 years never needed to use canes or walkers only at 1st when had replacements-did for that immediate after surgery-was down 4 months with replacements. Foot doctor appointment was she will tackle soon. Scheduled for a biopsy on her uterus was she is concentrating on that once she gets past that they picked that up in annual pelvic exam about a month ago; if that doesn&#39;t have any lasting need for any further treatment she will tackle this knee pain, breast cancer was 1st stage taken care of no further mammograms not on any medication for it; operated on Sep2020 until now another part of her needs to be looked at no reason it won&#39;t be nothing just questionable if something might be brewing; just going to do a biopsy of uterus because of ultrasound need to be looked at again. Arthritis was definitely what caused the knee surgeries. Very active gone on to have a full life radio program curates the art in her town. Does her own grocery shopping. Lives alone since husband died. Patient tested her for genetics relative to breast cancer she is not passing anything on to her daughter of the female breast genes don&#39;t think it goes any further. Patient does not take a lot in the past she had very serious lyme disease; no real relapse in that last 10 years; before that she spent 10 years in treatment for lyme disease so she could go back to that. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Concomitant medication(s) included celecoxib (CELEBREX) taken for pain, start and stop date were not reported; thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID) taken for thyroid disorder from 2001 to an unspecified stop date. The patient experienced pain in her pelvis on 31Jan2021, same pain feeling in bladder and pelvis on an unspecified date, sore arm on an unspecified date, had pain that was just in the knee replacements, where knee replacements on unspecified date, pain on 31Jan2021, standing up feels weird on 28Jan2021.This is report 1 of 8. The patient who reported pain standing up feels weird and sore arm after first dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. Pain on the 3rd day after the first dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine she woke with pain in her pelvis and thought she had a urinary tract-captured as provided as only urinary tract- which she doesn&#39;t usually have. Then on the 4th day after first dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine she had the same pain feeling in bladder and pelvis. She was seeing a cancer doctor that day for a 6-month check-up who ran a urine sample, and it was negative. She knew it was negative because that symptom was pretty intense on 3rd and 4th day but then it was gone. The pain took her all the way back to when she had the knee replacement surgeries; she was on Morphine then which she can&#39;t do that now; they wouldn&#39;t give it to her. She had using Advil and some Celebrex which she was not supposed to use those because of her heart condition which was under control. Advil and Celebrex taken for the pain have done nothing for the pain they are doing nothing they don&#39;t touch the pain. Her family doctor suggested she try marijuana. her cancer doctor was trying to get her medical marijuana; but nothing&#39;s happened in 6-8 weeks. Pain was making her crazy, did buy the marijuana it comes like candy like little gummy bears to try to alleviate the pain that way but did not get the medical marijuana. The oncologist talked to his secretary and she was told they would contact her in 6 weeks. 6 weeks went by and they haven&#39;t contacted her. The Oncologist texted her she told him she hasn&#39;t gotten the medical marijuana card yet and you have to pay for the card. So her daughter in Massachusetts can buy marijuana that&#39;s legal there-so the patient tried little bit of a gummy bear which did nothing for the pain; so she tried a little more of a gummy bear which still did nothing for the pain; then another day she tried a whole gummy bear which still did nothing for the pain in her knees but she felt kind of fogged up in the head, after 6 days after the first dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine she woke up with both knees that she had a knee replacement in in 2014; and she had basically gotten over most of it; the 6th day after the shot she woke up and had pain that was just in the knee replacements where knee replacements both were. It was excruciating pain it woke her up and she has been pretty bad ever since. That was the most extreme day of pain was 6 days after the first dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. It was pretty bad and then it woke her up 10May2021 also. For the pain Advil doesn&#39;t touch it she has taken 600mg of Advil every day which she was not allowed to take because she had 2 stents in her heart during heart surgery performed in 2020. They don&#39;t really want you to take Advil or anything after that. She&#39;s pretty much suffering and was probably going to end up in pain management. She got the second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine and that second dose didn&#39;t make any difference did not worsen or affect events. She has to use a walker now; she had really gotten pretty much through that major surgery 5 years ago the double knee replacement surgery which she verified as being in 2014. She never got really great, but she could walk without a cane or any assistance. 09May2021 she when went to the cemetery to spread her deceased husband&#39;s ashes and had to use 2 canes so the pain definitely came from the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. The patient reporting adverse events with Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. Mentioned she has been using Advil and some Celebrex taken for pain which have done nothing for the pain they are doing nothing they don&#39;t touch the pain. Advil expiry: Jul2023 Lot: WJ22828 UPC/NDC was Unknown on top over the code they use when they do inventory or all. Patient has friends with hip replacements and knee replacements, and no one was saying anything about pain with their replacements. She was thinking the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was just attacking the foreign particles in her body which are the knee replacements. Celebrex: Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown dispensed in pharmacy vial. The outcome of the event pain in her pelvis was recovering, same pain feeling in bladder and pelvis, sore arm, had pain that was just in the knee replacements, where knee replacements was unknown, pain was recovering, standing up feels weird was recovered on unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected

A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at same age, dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jun2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0182; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021) as DOSE 2, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Borderline multiple myeloma (Borderline Multiple myeloma for 10-15 years), ongoing Monoclonal gammopathy, covid-19 from Mar2020, Severe allergies, ongoing having a lot of immunology problems going on/ immunocompromised, sarcoidosis from 1970, Russian flu, 5 episodes of anaphylaxis, had 9-10 episodes of total body hives, has been resuscitated twice, B cell blood malignancy, allergic to over 30 drugs and lingering COVID symptoms: dry cough, muscle and joint pain, headache, dizziness, and diarrhea. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previous received hepatitis vaccines and TB for immunization and experienced did not respond/ nonresponsive, received Swine Flu for immunization and received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0173, expiry: 31Aug2021), on 19May2021 (at the age of 78-year-old) as single for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced high fever, joint pain, some weakness in her legs/severe muscle weakness, headache, nausea, she was very ill / She said she was pretty sick for 10 days, diarrhea and muscle pain. The patient experienced dizzy, and severe muscle weakness, and pain/ weakness in legs, both on 10Jun2021 with serious criteria of disability, diarrhea, and had a fever of 102 for 5 days on 10Jun2021. Her immunologist cleared her for the vaccine because she has an unsettling allergy history. He did an immunology review of her allergies and prior vaccination problems before determining if she could get the COVID vaccine. He wrote her a letter that said she had to get the vaccine in a room with an IV ready and the defibrillator ready as well. Her immunologist thought it was prudent she try the first dose. She did have COVID already in 2020. She ended up in the emergency room from the vaccine. She was reticent to get the second dose because she had barely recovered from the first dose when she was due for her second dose. The second dose reaction was different. The day she got the second dose 09Jul2021, she got home okay without problem and went to bed. When she got up in the morning she had trouble getting out of bed. She had difficulty walking. She said she had a severe bilateral leg and sacral pain to the point where she had difficulty walking (10Jun2021). She also said there was numbness in her leg, swelling in her &#34;sacrum,&#34; and really horrible radiating pain down both of her legs, front and back. She was fine the day she received the shot, but had great difficulty getting out of bed the next day. She said she still could not drive because she was still dizzy and nauseated. She added that she had headache, nausea, and diarrhea. She said she had on and off diarrhea for 6 or 7 days, and couldn&#39;t keep anything down without having it. She said she had severe joint pain, severe muscle weakness, and pain, and had a fever of 102 for 5 days (from 10Jun2021 to 15Jun2021). On the 5th day of her having fever, she said she was struggling to put one foot in front of the other in terms of walking. She said she was also starting to feel as if she was paralyzed. She was having troubles trying to walk normally since there was weakness in her legs. She also said she did not have any appetite. She spent a lot of time in bed, sleeping, and had troubles staying awake. She said she had a bad headache. She said she called 911, and went to the hospital. She stayed there for 2 days. She said it was very unpleasant. She also had neurological problems as well such as extreme difficulty in walking, standing up, and profound leg weakness. However, she said that her neurologist assured her that it would go away within 4 to 5 weeks. She said it has already been 5 weeks since her 2nd dose, but she was still not feeling well. She was improving, but not well. She said she was physically not much better. She was having severe bilateral leg and sacral pain. Her sacrum was hot and swollen so she called the ambulance. She went to the ER because she had difficulty walking. She went to the ER. After five days of the second dose she still had a fever and trouble walking. The ER did multiple scans including a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, an x-ray of her pelvis, and MRI of her upper and lower spine. She also had blood cultures and multiple lab work done. They were trying to rule out Guillain-Barre. She was in the ER for 2 days. She was very sick. The second day she was in the ER they told her she could go home. She thought it was because they were busy. No one explained to her the results of her tests or what was going on. Once her fever was done they didn&#39;t have to deal with her anymore. They sent her home when she was still sick with leg pain, trouble walking, and still had diarrhea. She was still nauseated, and was just eating jello. It is week 5 and she is really physically not much better. She can&#39;t drive because she was still dizzy and nauseated. She has leg pain, trouble sleeping, and muscle weakness in her legs. She is not recovered from the second dose. She thought she was going to die from it. It took a lot to call 911 especially as a nurse, but the numbness and pain in her legs was really severe. She had such weakness that she had trouble standing up and navigating through her apartment without falling down. She had made slight improvement. She mentioned that she had the flu back in 1988, so she felt very ill, and was in the hospital for 2 weeks. She was a long haul COVID patient who is enrolled in a long haul COVID program. She has been sick for a year and a half now since having COVID. She got COVID in Mar2020, and did not recover well. that is one of the reasons why they delayed her vaccination. She had to do prednisone during that time, and had to wait 6 weeks after completing the Prednisone to get the vaccine. Her baseline was a subnormal temperature of 96.1 because of her immunology issue. So 102 is really high for her. She had lingering COVID symptoms, and was a long haul patient. She had a cyclic problem with dry cough, muscle and joint pain, headache, dizziness, and diarrhea. She would have it bad for 7 days, and then recover a couple of days, and then it repeats itself. She couldn&#39;t drive because she was too dizzy and weak to drive. It was not safe to drive. She didn&#39;t have enough strength in legs to stop the car. She was seen by a neurologist several days after her emergency room visit. He examined her, and asked her reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. He said he had other patients with similar outcomes. She was immunocompromised . She has had borderline Multiple myeloma for 10-15 years. She has Monoclonal gammopathy, MGUS, she had it for a while. There are periods of time where her protein is elevated making her borderline for myeloma. She has had a couple rounds of prednisone to suppress the protein. She has a positive ANC. She has a multitude of issues. She was diagnosed with sarcoidosis in 1970 bust is in remission. She is tested regularly for sarcoidosis. She thinks she might be having a gallbladder attack now. In the past, she has been a non responder to vaccines. She got out of healthcare for that reason. She did not respond to hepatitis vaccines. She doesn&#39;t have NDC/lot/expiration for those vaccines. The infectious disease doctor at the time told her she shouldn&#39;t be a nurse for that reason because it put her at risk for hepatitis. She was also nonresponsive to TB. She doesn&#39;t have NDC/lot/expiration to any of the ones she has been non responsive to. Last time she was vaccinated she had Swine Flu. She was having a lot of immunology problems going on. The doctor recommended her not get a flu vaccine. It was later discovered that she was a non responder to hepatitis and TB. She has had no flu vaccine since swine flu in the 70s. In 1988 she had the flu, and was in hospital for two weeks and almost died from that. One of the doctors she worked with died from flu. He was a surgeon. He died so she thought she was going to. She barely squeezed by. She was allergic to over 30 drugs&#39;. No information on those drugs provided. She has had 5 episodes of anaphylaxis. She had been resuscitated twice. She has had 9-10 episodes of total body hives. The COVID vaccine knocked her down to 0. She has had to cancel her last 5 weeks of life. She was homebound. She couldn&#39;t get out of bed and get dressed. When she had COVID in Mar2020, she had an antibody tested 3 months later and 6 months later that both showed no antibodies. She has a B cell blood malignancy, and the b cells pump up the immune system. So she wasn&#39;t surprised she didn&#39;t have antibodies. Events caused emergency room visit and physician office visit. The outcomes of events dizzy, severe muscle weakness, and pain/ weakness in legs, She said she had a severe bilateral leg and sacral pain to the point where she had difficulty walking, nausea, diarrhea, had a fever of 102 for 5 days were recovering while other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information in the case report and a plausible temporal relationship, a possible causal relationship between the events &#34;dizziness and muscular pain&#34; and suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 79-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 18Dec2020 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication in two weeks included citalopram, levothyroxine, atorvastatin, anastrozol.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 3rd day (21Dec2020), the patient experienced severe chest and back pains on right at time of 12:30 AM. On 4th day (22Dec2020) pains radiating down right arm, chest and back, nausea and vomiting. On 5th day (23Dec2020) pain under right arm pit, very stiff neck, pain radiating into ear. Temperature was normal. On 6th day (24Dec2020) most symptoms dissipated. On 7th day (25Dec2020) almost back to normal. No treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, it was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was recovered in Dec2020.

                                                Started getting headache within minutes of shot.   Bad body aches for about 12 hours.   Everything ached and couldn&#39;t get comfortable to sit, stand, lay down.  Stomach cramps that doubled me over lasted for a few hours.    Last 4 hours could barely walk.   Husband had to help walk me to the bathroom.  Chills and shaking and could not warm up after the 1st hour through the rest of the night! Everything started going away about 1:00 in the afternoon and felt better at 2:00.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (also reported as Pfizer Covid vaccine, lot number: EK4176), intramuscular into left arm on 05Jan2021 16:00 at single dose indicated as presentation because she is a nurse/Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Type 2 Diabetes, about 2 years ago in 2019 in which she takes metformin 1,000mg twice daily. Concomitant medication included metformin on unspecified date at 1,000mg twice daily for Type 2 Diabetes. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine nor there were additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Covid vaccine. The patient received the Pfizer COVID vaccine last Tuesday and since 06Jan2021 at 06:00, she has been sick as a dog. She is running a fever, has chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite because she is nauseous; all on 06Jan2021 at 06:00. This is the third day of it.  She would like to know what she can she do. She said that it all started Wednesday morning when she got up. It just gets worse every day.  It looks like it would get better by now, but it hasn&#39;t.  She never runs a temperature, but she has now (unspecified date).  She is still freezing to death on unspecified date. She usually has a good appetite.  Even the thought of food makes her sick. She further reported that she has had nothing but chills, fever, and nausea and states it will not go away. She is treating it with ibuprofen. She confirms she already talked to a nurse in this department to report this and she was transferred to see what she could do and states they never answered. This is her first dose and she does not know if she should get the second dose. The patient can&#39;t calm down since she has been sick since last Wednesday. She stated that she needed some help because she is so sick. She was suggested to call again calling Pfizer medical information department. She stated that she had called back three times, but there is no such number. The events sick as a dog, fever, chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite, and nauseous were considered serious (Other medically important condition). The outcome of the events sick as a dog, fever, chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite, and nauseous was not recovered, and the outcome of the remaining event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completed based on known safety profile and a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included major reaction to eating conch, and tested positive for COVID on 22Nov2020 There were no concomitant medications. Patient read that was not a good thing to do, to get the vaccine after only 2 months instead of 3 from diagnoses. When she had COVID she had major headache, chills, and diarrhea. After the vaccine she had had the same thing, terrible chills, bad headache and diarrhea on Jan2021. The side effects say that this was normal but she wants to know should she have waited the 90 days before getting the vaccine. Patient still had the headache and chills but she took an Imodium and the diarrhea was better. Patient had also fatigue in Jan2021,and slept all day yesterday (13Jan2021). She has had a very sore arm and at 2am she woke up trembling with chills on Jan2021. Outcome of the event chills and headache was not recovered, for diarrhea was recovering and for the remaining events was unknown. Patient had a major reaction to eating conch and wanted to make sure there was no shellfish involve in the vaccine.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

This 79 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284) in left arm, on 18Jan2021 at 12:00 PM or 01:00 PM, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pacemaker (she just had it checked on 18Jan2021 at the cardiologist and they said it was good for five more years), heart issue, dementia (before getting the vaccine). Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date in Jan2021 the patient experienced dementia (she had a bit of dementia right now, which she also had before getting the vaccine) and her feet felt like they were numb, like neuropathy (maybe she had that, it had never been checked). Since 19Jan2021 the patient could not walk, had difficulty in walking. She was using a cane as she did not want to fall, she weighed 200 lbs and her partner would never be able to get her up if she fell. She was able to walk with the cane. The patient said that there had been no other treatment for her difficulty in walking and it seemed to get better. The initial caller (patient&#39;s partner) said she had the shot too on 18Jan2021 and did not have those symptoms, she was not the one who was sick, she did not know what else was going on in her partner&#39;s body, they did not think the shot caused it. The patient said she was supposed to be on a sleep apnea machine but she could not get in to the doctor to get the machine checked, it needed a test to be rechecked but they could not get in to do it because of everything that is going on. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 08Feb2021 at 10:00AM. Difficulty in walking was improving. The other events outcome was unknown.

Specified cataract and glaucoma in left eye; but drop was administered to both eyes; and left eye was eye affected by Bell&#39;s palsy for Cataract and glaucoma in left eye. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergy with onset maybe about 50 years ago, she was not sure; occurred during dental procedure; had bad headaches but no lasting effects so they assumed allergy to codeine; she did not know if still has allergy but says she does if asked.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 (at the age of 79-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cholesterol.  Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR).  The patient previously took Aspirin (e.c.) about 10-15 years ago and experienced anaphylactic reaction, Lyrica about 10-15 years ago for neuralgia and experienced hypersensitivity. The patient reported that on 10Feb2021, she got the vaccine. When she first obtained the vaccine, she was put in a holding situation in regards to having any reaction. She was sitting there about 10-15 minutes, and the first reaction was a numbing on left side of her face and her eye, her jaw and then her left arm was tingling, then she developed a taste of metal in her mouth; had a very salty taste along with the metal taste in her mouth; her mouth became dry. Her heart felt like rush. The &#34;EMT&#34; guy was there, he watched her. So, she sat there for a while. She went home and her symptoms got progressively worse. It was almost an immediate reaction. She started to get an ache in her left eye/pressure in her eye, and feeling just kind of bumped out. Immediately, after she got the vaccine, she had a very salty taste along with the metal taste in my mouth. When I came home, my mouth became dry. The patient reported that she still have a salty taste in her mouth and have &#34;Covid tongue&#34;.  The patient also reported that she had a herpes simplex virus that was dormant unless she  get excited and it has been down for a long period of time. The patient reported that &#34;I am afraid to take my second dose&#34;. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. She  stated &#34; I just thought it would go away&#34;. The clinical outcome of the event salty taste in her mouth was not recovered. The clinical outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection lot number: EN6201), intramuscular at upper left arm on 17Feb2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis in right shoulder and arm gets inflamed and sore; rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm. It sometimes flares up and gets sore) diagnosed in late 2019, ongoing Autoimmune deficiency disease diagnosed in late 2019 and lower left eyelid which was inverted. There were no concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient previously took Shingrix vaccine (Shingles vaccine) at left arm last year-2020 and she felt soreness and achiness in right shoulder and arm. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine yesterday on 17Feb2021 at her left arm. A few hours later her right shoulder and right arm felt sore and achy. On 18Feb2021, the patient&#39;s right arm and shoulder were aching. The patient mentioned that this has also happened last year when she had a Shingrix vaccine. She was also injected in her left arm but her right arm got sore and achy. She felt soreness and achiness in right shoulder and arm. She wanted to know if this is a normal reaction from the vaccine. The patient stated that it was weird. On unspecified date, when she lifts her arm up high it hurts, she stated that she does have an inflamed shoulder. She did have an inflamed shoulder prior, it has been pretty good lately but flared up after the vaccine. During the night it was very bad. She does have rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm. It sometimes flares up and gets sore. She was wondering if there is a relationship with the COVID 19 vaccine because she felt like she got the COVID 19 vaccine in the right arm, she asked if she&#39;s reacting to the medication. No treatment was administered for right shoulder. Routine lab work done on 02Feb2021 but it has nothing to do with this. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The patient is also scheduled to have Botox in her lower eyelid for her left eye to release the nerve muscle. She asked if it is ok since she just had the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She is scheduled to get botox injection next week for lower left eyelid which is inverted, it was bothering her. They have to release the muscle by getting an injection of botox. She was receiving conflicting information from her PCP, who says wait a month and her ophthalmologist who says its ok to get the COVID 19 vaccine. She thought she heard something about not mixing botox with the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;She did have an inflamed shoulder prior, it has been pretty good lately but flared up after the vaccine/She does have rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm&#34; was unknown; and other events was recovering.

She heard that the second one should feel something going on more than first time. She did not know if she could get another vaccination or what she needed to do.  Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I have not been to Urgent care .  I informed people giving me vaccine I was on blood thinners.  Nobody seem to show concern about that.  I have already received 2nd shot, which I got very sick after, but symptoms seem to happen to others.  My concern is the lump on my leg if it is a clot and concern if I will get more now that I took the 2nd vaccine.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration, on 02Feb2021 12:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, knee surgery, and bulging disc.  The patient had an MRI on an unspecified date in Jan2021 (a week and a half prior to the date of initial report) with result of bulging disc. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate (ARNUITY ELLIPTA) for asthma; She was supposed to take 1 puff a day. However, being in the house, she had no problems, she had maybe used it twice a week since she hasn&#39;t had any problems, she last took 1 puff on 01Feb2021). She was also taking vitamin pills concomitantly. On 04Feb2021 23:00, 2 days after the vaccine, the patient had sweats, was wringing wet, and was not feeling well. Her hair was wet, and she was sweating. She was okay on the morning of 05Feb2021 but not herself. She had a little nausea on 05Feb2021. She was just not quite herself on 05Feb2021 but doesn&#39;t have the sweats. She further reported that she had her first shot on 02Feb2021 12:00. She was fine and had no problems. However, on night of 04Feb2021, before bed, she started getting hot and sweaty, like she was wringing wet. She didn&#39;t feel good, but 2 days had gone by and she was fine. She also went to bed with something like chills (later clarified as not chills), she went to sleep on the morning of 05Feb2021 and felt okay but not that great. When queried when the chills started, she said that it was not really chills, she was just very sweaty, wringing wet. She stated that she never sweats, and in this case her whole hair was wet. Being older, she was wondering what was going. Her feeling hot and sweaty subsided during the night. She did start to feel nausea, or she thought maybe she hasn&#39;t had anything to eat and so had a half banana and then she was okay. She thought she was hungry and felt funny, she had the half banana and was okay. She also felt a little shaky and nervous on 04Feb2021; however, it all subsided after going to bed. At the date of report, 05Feb2021, she felt okay but she didn&#39;t feel completely herself. Her second dose is scheduled on 26Feb2021 at 9:15 AM. Outcome of events feeling hot and sweaty was recovered with sequel on 05Feb2021. Outcome of event not feeling well was unknown. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 05Feb2021. Outcome of the events shaky and nervous was recovered on 04Feb2021. Outcome of she was just not quite herself was not recovered.

Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

Reporter (Nurse) stated &#34;I had my first Pfizer vaccine on Friday, I think 22Jan2021 and the only thing I have was the sore arm and got really tired okay and the sore arm went away, it descended in about 12 hours and gracely went away, after that it started itching, okay no problem.  I had my second vaccine this past Friday at about 8 O&#39;clock between 8:15 in the morning. As the day went on I felt my arm is a little bit sore, no problem. Okay I went to bed and about 3 O&#39;clock in the morning, I woke up and I was shivering, I was so cold and I ached all over and I said okay I am getting the flu, went back to sleep, by the time I got up in the morning about 6 o&#39;clock the aching was gone but I could not walk, it was like I was drunk. I have a little dog and she was barking to go out and it was like 0 here so I sat there for a minute and I left her out and she started barking, to bring her back and I could not walk, I kept walking into the walls and my house was just this dark, I thought it&#39;s so dark in my house so I got my little dog back in, sat down and again and I thought what, maybe I will take my blood pressure, so I did and it was 66 over 48 so I though okay, so I started drinking, I thought I got to eat, I got to drink, so I get that, my pressure came up to 80 over 62 or something, my pulse rate was like 116, my O2 stat was like 98 percent so that was not a problem. So, I ate and drink, as the day went on the pressure came up to like about 103, gradually last night by the time I went to bed, the only thing I had was a little bit of headache, I did not thought enough to take anything for, when I went to bed, my pressure was like 120, the systolic was 120 and diastolic was like 70 something, this morning when I got up my pressure was in the 90&#39;s. I was not taking any blood pressure medication, I mean I have but doctor took me off long time ago, I did not I mean I have no aches, I have no pains, I have nothing just a little bit of headache, not even enough to bother me, every now and then I think about it, I also, I mean I thought I have got to the bathroom, I had diarrhea terribly, something, I did not know if any of this is from the vaccine. I have not called my primary, I thought I called him tomorrow I mean I am fine, I am little short of breath when I walk up to the stairs but that is nothing unusual.&#34; Causality: Reporter stated &#34;I don&#39;t know, I am thinking it does I never had anything like this before but you know I don&#39;t know, I don&#39; know, I am just reporting it, I am 79 so I don&#39;t know how much this is, I don&#39;t know.&#34; When probed from where reporter got the vaccine, Reporter stated &#34;I got it the first one at (Institute name).&#34; LOT# of COVID-19 Vaccine administered on 22Jan2021: Reporter stated &#34;You know it&#39;s not on my little card, just the LOT# of second one is on here. The first vaccine was 22Jan2021, the second one was 12Feb2021.&#34; Reporter provided the LOT# as EM9809 for second shot of COVID-19 Vaccine administered on 12Feb2021 and did not have LOT# of the first vaccine administered on 22Jan2021. Date of side effects: Reporter stated &#34;I think when I started having difficulty was the morning of 13Feb2021.&#34; (Not clarified further).  Still experiencing side effects: Reporter stated, &#34;No, finally last, I felt yesterday I felt like I kind of had the flu, I have got to get the flu, but it was not enough to stop me, I kept going, I went to work, I did all my stuff, this morning I got up I felt fine.&#34; (Not clarified further). Treatment: Reporter stated: No, did not take anything, no. Other medications: Reporter stated &#34;the generic 10 mg.&#34; (Not clarified further). Reporter stated &#34;No I was just going to report this, like I said I don&#39;t know if this is a problem or not. I have never had anything like this before, I thought this is something you needed to know.&#34; Reason of delay: Daily spike of incoming calls due to COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome of all events was unknown except for event I ached all over, outcome was recovered on an unspecified date.

On 31Jan2021, the patient ended up in ER with hives from the vaccine. She was told that she would be given Prednisone for hives but not to take it until Monday at noon. Stated that they wanted her to wait 48 hours after vaccine before she started it because it would cut it in half. She started Prednisone 40mg on Monday and did get a few more hives on Tuesday and Wednesday. She had the shot in her right arm, and all this happened on the left side of her back. She had a patch of hive of 5x6 to 8x8 on her back and on the back of her arm by her elbow and forearm. She put apple cider vinegar on her arms, and she did not itch anymore. Someone told her that this could be shingles. She stated that she got flu vaccine and got sick with flu and she took the shingles vaccine and got shingles. She could not stand in shower with the shingles but that she can with this, so she knows that it is not the shingles. The patient did not want to take the second shot on 20Feb2021 and wanted to know what Pfizer thinks. She does like to travel and hopes to soon so she wanted to know if not taking the shot could get a stipulation if they required two shots to travel. She has nerve on back shoulder to side and back of arm to forearm to her thumb which is not spasming, but she knows that it is there which came on in the past week (2021). She was on Prednisone 40 mg for 5 days and she still had hives (though they are diminishing). The patient stated that she still has &#34;lizard skin&#34;. She received the shot on her right arm, but the hives spread on the left shoulder down the arm and forearm where she had shingles. Her ER doctor told her not to take the second dose and her primary care physician told her to wait and think about it. She is wondering if she should receive the second dose. The outcome of the event hives was not recovered while the other events was unknown.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

Medical history included thyroid and pericarditis fluid. Family history included brother had heart disease. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) ongoing for thyroid for 20 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 in left shoulder on 21Jan2021 (Batch/lot number: EN6201) for COVID-19 immunization with no side effects.  The patient had her 2nd Pfizer vaccine dose on 11Feb2021 and received a &#34;medrol pack&#34; on 20Feb2021 for &#34;shoulder, back and neck pain. She have felt lousy for 4 weeks. She went to the hospital with palpitations and it probably was from the 2nd pack of methylprednisolone, she was prescribed after the 1st pack did not really help her pain. She haven&#39;t been sick or had a cold for 25 years and the 2nd dose through her for a loop. She stated her daughter called her and she said that her doctor told her that her vaccine may not be effective and she may not be protected because she took methylprednisolone. The patient received the second vaccine on 11Feb2021 and she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling. The patient mentioned she went to her doctor because after calling the COVID hotline they said they had cases where some of the vaccine had seeped into the lymph nodes. She was told to have her lymph nodes. No patient demographic details provided regarding those other patients who had the vaccine seep into lymph nodes. She went on to explain she went to the doctor, but the doctor said there were no problems with the lymph nodes. On 13Feb2021, she felt achy and fatigued, back discomfort. The lightheadedness occurred on 18Feb2021. The doctor gave her a high dose of the methylprednisolone 4mg pack for a week. 16 days later on 27Feb2021 it had not touched the discomfort in back, fatigue and lightheadedness and gave her another pack of methylprednisolone.  She also had heart palpitation, was sweaty and went to the Emergency Room. The patient mentioned she took a low dose of levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). She asked the doctor about the methylprednisolone being taken after the shot. The patient heard it diminished the effect of the shot, that she may not have as much protection. She had called the COVID hotline to address this issue and they said people who were on chronic steroid therapy had no problem as far as they know. The patient asked if she was protected because she had the methylprednisolone pack the first one within 9 days after shot and a second pack 16 days later. She took a low dose of generic levothyroxine sodium every day. She commented she was concerned with the drug interaction and wanted to make sure still protected. She was informed by individual who answered COVID hotline she felt like she was still protected because others have been on chronic steroid therapy.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6202; Expiry Date: 30Jun2021), administered in left arm on 03Mar2021 (at the age of 79-years) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced discomfort, mild malaise, trembling, on an unspecified date she says she feels a little fuzzy, like she was not thinking clearly and she says she was not able to do anything due to exhaustion. she has been having three days of discomfort and mild malaise for a week. The patient says she was not able to do anything due to exhaustion, so she thought Pfizer would want to know. She says that she could not type due to trembling to complete a report online. Patient second dose was on 26Mar2021, and they did not ask for her vaccine card, so she does not have and was not able to provide NDC/LOT/EXP from the second dose. She says that the NDC was not provided on her vaccine card for the first dose. The patient mentions a COVID test, but says that this was just a paper, she had forgot that she had a card, the test was to do a job. Patient says it was the second dose that she had a reaction after. She says she got both doses in her left arm. She says her reaction was discomfort and mild malaise beginning Saturday. Patient said that it has not got better or worse, she was having intermittent trembling periods where she would feel ok but then start shaking and be exhausted again, so it has been about the same since Saturday. Patient said that she will be ok for a couple hours, and then it will all start again, and she will shake all over. Patient felt a little fuzzy, like she was not thinking clearly, and so tired and trembling. The patient said that her prolonged reaction was not enough to go to the hospital, but she was not feeling so good, and thinks maybe people should be warned. The patient did not receive any treatment for adverse event. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 79-Year- old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

She has recovered completely she says the next morning she woke up and felt rejuvenated. She said the stuffiness and sneezing happened before the hangover feeling it was probably Saturday after the vaccine that she had the stuffy nose and sneezing, she says 30Jan2021 sounds right. She says she has recovered completely since then everything is going good. Patient asked who she was talking to she got the number off the paper she got after the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She wanted to people applaud her people for being so orderly and efficient it only took, she only had to wait half an hour all together it was about 45 minutes but the efficiency was great that they gave them at the Hospital. She said she wanted to tell Pfizer how much she appreciated and just check to see how long after the vaccine could she have any kind of reaction. She said she was asking because she thinks she may have had a reaction but she does not know so she wanted to try to see if it was one. She said this happened a week later didn&#39;t have any thing when she got the vaccine except her arm was sore but that was it. Then, she is 80 years old and she doesn&#39;t drink but she felt like a she had a hangover and her nose was stuffy and she sneezing. Patient declined to provide email address. She hardly ever uses it. It was reported that decline to provide because she was fine. She feels like a million bucks. She had to get her glasses to read the vaccine record card. She does not see and expiration date or NDC number just the date she got it. It was reported that she did not want to get the dangerous flu at her age that would be a horrible death. She was only on high blood pressure medication. The outcome of the event her arm was sore was unknown and outcome of the other events was recovered.  No further information provided.

A 79-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient medical history included spinal stenosis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient concomitant medications were not reported. Patient persistently asked what to do to manage her symptoms from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. She explained her doctor said he cannot help and has not seen this before.  She then threatened to call her lawyer if a doctor or scientist from the company could not assist her. It was stated that patient received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 26Feb2021. She explained a few days after, her arm was sore near the injection site, then the soreness spread to her shoulder and she can barely move her arm and shoulder. She added she was in excruciating pain; it is terrible and debilitating. She took pain medicine for the arthritis in back and described it as spinal stenosis. She mentioned this medication was barely doing something to help with her arm pain. She then specified she also consulted her doctor who prescribed gabapentin and methyl prednisone tablets, which aren&#39;t relieving her arm pain. She expressed her concerns on the persistence and intensity of her pain. She asked if her symptoms were reported as side effects to the vaccine. Patient expressed her disappointment on the lack of information provided to manage her symptoms from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. She said she was excited to get this vaccine among the other brand, and now that she is injured from it, she feels like Pfizer should be by her side and thus claims to have help from Pfizer. Outcome of the event her arm pain and her arm were sore near the injection site was not recovered. Outcome of the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered on the left arm on 21Apr2021 13:12 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia (diagnosed more than 20 years ago), bladder cancer (diagnosed 13 years ago the first time, 8 reoccurrences and has been cancer free for 2 years, cancer free for 2 years), multi drug allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, diabetes, and obesity. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, levothyroxine, and oxazepam. No vaccines received within 2 weeks. In 12 minutes after the injection on 21Apr2021, while she was still sitting in the parking lot, patient developed tachycardia on and extreme flushing to face and neck on 13:20.  They were as red as being in the sun.  She was aware of tachycardia first.  Then she looked in the mirror and was glowing red. Patient was observing in parking lot and took her pulse and it was 145. Persistent head to toe macular erythematous rash occurred next.  They took her to the ER about 20 minutes after the injection. In the ER, she was given 25mg of Benadryl IV and 125 mg of Solumedrol IV.  When both of those wore off the next day, the generalized rash came back on Thursday (22Apr2021).  The rash was persistent but not as flushed looking as before. When they got her into ER, the first blood pressure reading was 198/117, which was within 20 minutes of injection. Hypertension was experienced on 13:30. Her blood pressure usually was fairly low and was back to normal now. She had one reading of 124/76 to 170/something. Her normal range is anywhere between 150-170/70-80&#39;s. She is on Lisinopril. The other morning when it was 124/76, was just a fluke. That was an unusually good reading. They did a regular panel of lab work when she went to the ER. They did not tell her that anything was abnormal.  She asked them to run an A1C, but they told her they could not. They did a chest film, EKG, placed IV to give medications, but no fluids given. Her doctor said not to get second dose of the vaccine.  She had it at the hospital and they had reports of other people with a rash. The patient considered the events tachycardia, extreme flushing, macular erythematous rash and hypertension were medically significant while for headache was non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were possibly causally related to the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to plausible temporal relationship.  This case will be reassessed should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She has had multiple GI bleeds secondary to esophageal varices and is followed regularly by Dr who has had to do multiple banding procedures on her.   She also relates she has an enlarged spleen and is followed by Dr.   In the emergency room she was noted to be febrile and hypotensive. She received a total of 5 L of normal saline in the ER to bring her pressures up with a systolic below 100. She has a very elevated procalcitonin as well as lactic acid. Urine is positive for large amount of blood and small leukocyte esterase  Hospital Course 79 y.o. year old female with HTN, infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast stage I status post lumpectomy with positive margins was on anastrozole but taken off secondary to abnormal liver enzyme testing, CLL/thrombocytopenia stage I with no treatment needed, fatty liver complicated by portal hypertension/splenomegaly resulting in bleeding esophageal varices, history of viral cardiomyopathy in 2006, B12 deficiency, history of admission for septic shock, chronic diarhea, presented to the emergency room on 2/14 complaining of fevers, myalgias fatigue nausea and vomiting 24 hours after having a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

It was reported that patient had a really crazy experience, She received her first dose on 25Feb2021 at around 10:30 am afterwards, she had just a regular headache and then the next morning, she tried to get out of bed and had no strength at all in her legs and her arms. She got up out of bed, and her legs would not hold her up so she collapsed on the floor. She mentions her husband is hard of hearing and she was calling for his name to help her. She could not even scoot on the floor, her muscles just did not work at all. The caller states her husband came in and got her up. She went to the bathroom and then for the rest of the day, she stayed in the recliner. Really, the next day, she got back her strength in her shoulders. She clarifies on Saturday, 27Feb2021, she started to get back her strength. She also read in the newspaper to not get a mammogram and a COVID-19 vaccine on the day and she did because they didn&#39;t know. She confirms her mammogram was scheduled on 25Feb2021 at 2pm, which was after when she received the COVID-19 vaccine, so her mammogram might not be right. The outcome of events recovered on 27Feb2021. No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The very next day I was so weak I couldn&#39;t get out of bed and was having a hard time breathing.  I called 911 and was taken to the hospital which resulted in being admitted.

                                                rectal bleeding; sensation/pain in her right arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EW1051), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm on 15May2021 17:30 (at the age of 79years) as 1st dose, single for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergic to lemons, vinegar and white wine, severe reaction to some eye drops 4-5 years ago, vomiting, and diarrhea, rectal bleeding, stomach hurt, and felt like her head was going to explode. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she was allergic to lemons, vinegar and white wine and can&#39;t take any pills because they make her stomach hurt, she now only takes natural medicines. She had a margarita the week before the vaccine that had some lemon juice in it, and she had rectal bleeding for a few days. She also had a severe reaction to some eye drops 4-5 years ago, she does not know the name of the medication, just that it was a generic. Half an hour after putting it in one eye she said it felt like her head was going to explode and thought she was going to die. The ambulance was called but refused to go in and had her friend take her in. She also experienced vomiting and diarrhea. On 16May2021, the day after the shot (Covid vaccine) she had some rectal bleeding similar to a light period but only for one day.  She also had the shot in the left arm but had a sensation/pain in her right arm that went away quickly. The patient was unsure if that happened because she also had 2 margaritas and they made it with lemons which she is allergic to so it might have been that. The patient asked if the vaccine have any vinegar or wine in it. The patient also asked if she could get the second dose of the vaccine if she&#39;s had a severe reaction to some eye drops 4-5 years ago. She doesn&#39;t remember name of medication but had severe side effects including her head felt like her head was going to explode, vomiting, and diarrhea. The outcome of event rectal bleeding was recovered on 17May2021, while the outcome of event sensation/pain in her right arm was recovered on an unspecified date.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Formulation: Solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Left upper on 24May2021 11:30 AM (at the age of 79-year-old), as 1st dose, 0.3 ML single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included first pulmonary embolism in 2007; second in 2017 Went to hospital 23Jan2017, left hospital 5 days later. Patient has allergy to aspirin from Dec1982 to ongoing. (Patient Had headache, took Aspirin in 20 minutes had severe reaction-like never seen. Did not go to hospital, never felt throat closing off, coughing, trouble breathing. Skin felt on fire inside and out, took everything off, ice cold shower, skin beet red felt on fire all over, skin looked like elephant skin, wavy; Neighbor nurse gave her liquid Benadryl she drank. Within 15 minutes everything started to clear up, never been near Aspirin again). Patient has allergy to Advil from 1985 To Ongoing. (Had Severe reaction. Did not go to hospital, never felt throat closing off, coughing or trouble breathing. Couple years later had new job picked up fever from little kids coming in. Took Advil had reaction started the same way as with Aspirin, but she had Benadryl at home and able to catch it in time. Never taken again). Patient has allergic to other things, has environmental allergies. She kept Benadryl in her purse. Patient had Gall bladder surgery from 1985 to Unspecified date. (When had gall bladder taken out, they gave her Percodan and Percocet in hospital, had reaction of rash so they had to take her off Percodan and Percocet and give her Benadryl). Patient had Titanium filter in place from 24Jan2017 to ongoing. On 23Jan2017, patient was hospitalized because she could not breathe with pulmonary embolism, they put titanium filter in place probably after midnight so on 24Jan2017. Patient had lumbar stenosis with pinched nerve from 49 years of being a nurse. A few years ago, she had 2 procedures where they would inject long-acting unknown product, she guesses Cortisone but did not know the name of the product she guesses Cortisone but does not know the name of the product. On her right hand the numbness was still there. Patient underwent EMG test and a couple weeks later he told her he thought she has carpel tunnel. The concomitant medications include Eliquis taken for pulmonary embolisms (2.5 mg, 2x/day) from unspecified date of Jan2017 to ongoing. Synthroid taken for thyroid problem from unspecified date to unspecified date. Eliquis has to be a pretty powerful drug; don&#39;t know about Pfizer Covid Vaccines, wondered if something interacted because excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand and couldn&#39;t move her fingers took a little over 4 days after Pfizer Covid Vaccine for onset. The patient previously took (years ago) hepatitis vaccine, shingles vaccine, pneumonia vaccine, no reactions to those; she was very cautious did not leave the office too soon after vaccines. She never got flu shot; when she was first in nurses training, she had a reaction to the flu vaccine in like 1960 and was in the emergency room. This retired Registered Nurse was the patient who called regarding her first dose of Pfizer Covid Vaccine. She reported tiredness; eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see; excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand; She couldn&#39;t move her fingers. She also mentioned red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site. She reported she had absolutely no symptoms, nothing after the Pfizer Covid Vaccine other than tiredness, feeling kind of tired, that&#39;s about it. On27May2021 in the afternoon she had onset of her eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes. She washed her eyes out, and the burning and watering went away after she washed them. She had no make-up on, no eye make-up on for a few days at that time. Otherwise, everything was ok. She went to bed last night and during the night she woke up with excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand. She couldn&#39;t move her fingers for maybe a minute or two. Eventually she was able to move her fingers a little, then more and more and the event stopped, she kind of went back to normal and fell asleep. A couple of hours later she had the same event reoccur, just down to the hand, all 10 fingers, couldn&#39;t move them for a few minutes and then after that she could, they seemed to be ok, and she fell asleep again. Whether event started 27May2021 or 28May2021 is unknown, unknown onset times. She has been fined all day. She has written checks out, made meals, coffee, washed and dressed herself, had no other problems. At her age it was hard to tell when the tiredness started regarding time of onset. Thinks in the evening of 24May2021 she felt onset, tired and the next day on 25May2021 she had a couple episodes where her arms felt really heavy just for a short time maybe 30 seconds and then the episodes went away and she just felt tired. 26May2021 she noticed she was not as tired, and yesterday and today improved, feeling pretty good. Seriousness of all the events was not specified by reporter. The outcome of the events eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes was recovered on 27May2021. Time of onset: late morning, probably about 11:00-11:30 really burned, then eyes started to really, really water. She was familiar with her house so she held onto furniture to get to the bathroom and as soon as she rinsed her eyes out event never happened again. Her eyes are not bothering her.The outcome of excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand and couldn&#39;t move her fingers was resolved on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the event tiredness and red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site was recovering.  Follow up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on close temporal association the causal association between the reported event she almost could not see for a few minutes with the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The contributory effect of the patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications also need to be considered. The case will be reassessed should the additional information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 79-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0153) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 03Jun2021 13:00 (at the age of 79-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included her first cataract surgery on her right eye, and they found out she had glaucoma. She got a slight infection which is unusual after cataract surgery. She weighs around 188. She is trying to be healthier in general. She had so much going on in 2020, like everybody else. Her sister was really ill and she passed away She and her daughter were planning to fly in August and wanted to be fully vaccinated before they fly. She had been through this before as a child when she had the polio vaccine and there are people she knows got polio who are still affect by it as adults. She is also on blood thinners. She got good reports from her eye doctor. She had no eye pressure. A couple days later she saw her primary doctor and everything was good there. She sees her cardiologist on 17Jun2021. The main thing is she had been on blood thinners since Apr2017. She hopes she doesn&#39;t have to be on them for the rest of her life, but it&#39;s a possibility. She has to take that twice a day. She also takes a high blood pressure medicine and thyroid medication. She was told to tell the nurse to use a smaller needle. She has arthritis in both of her knees which is kind of hereditary. She had a fall after the campfire. They evacuated, and when they came back and fell in a store. She is getting physical therapy. The Pradaxa is quite expensive. She takes it twice a day. She keeps a log. This medication can&#39;t have air reach it, so she can&#39;t use a pill box with that. She keeps a journal and logs her medicines. She takes eye drops for her glaucoma. She takes a drop in both eyes before bedtime. It gives it a chance to rest and for the drops to absorb. She stated that diabetes runs in her family. On 20Mar2021 she had her first cataract surgery, so they gave her anesthesia for that. Glaucoma, cataract, arthritis, fall. Concomitant medication(s) included dabigatran etexilate mesilate (PRADAXA) taken for anticoagulant therapy from Apr2017 and ongoing, unspecified high blood pressure medication, thyroid medication and eye drops for glaucoma in both eyes before bedtime which would give a chance to rest and for the drops to absorb. Historical vaccination included polio vaccine.  On 03Jun2021, It started that day she had the vaccine. Her vaccine was at 13:00. It was 104 that day so she stayed hydrated and drank a lot of water. She came home and had a little soreness. She was surprised she didn&#39;t have any big noticeable difference. With her arm soreness she was surprised it hurt in her shoulder. If she touches the site she can feel that, but she was okay and was well. On 04Jun2021 she had a headache the next day, and she did take Tylenol. She tried to prolong taking the Tylenol because she heard not to take Tylenol before the vaccine or too soon afterwards to give the vaccine a chance to do its thing. She went ahead and took Tylenol and it worked. It kicked in, and her headache went away the same day. She heard from other people that is was a classic symptom. Her symptoms weren&#39;t something she had to stay in bed for. She had a little anxiety before she had the vaccine. She read up as much as she could and decided on Pfizer because she had spoken with other people who had Pfizer. She will continue to wear a mask, she is really good at that. Outcome of the event headache was recovered on 04Jun2021. Outcome of other events it was recovering.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: unknown) via unspecified route of administration in arm left on 06Mar2021at 11:00 (at the age of 79-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history of the patient included high blood pressure, sinus issues. Family Medical History included that her daughter has had reaction to medications, she had flu vaccine and she ended up in the emergency department, she had trouble breathing. Concomitant medications included atenolol started a long time ago taken for high blood pressure. Patient previously used clindamycin as in her age she occasionally breaks. Patient previously received flu vaccine in 2009 for immunization and had a reaction. She had the Flu vaccine for many years and the one she had trouble with was a vaccine without preservatives. On 06Mar2021, seven hours after receiving first dose of vaccination, in the evening patient noticed that her mouth started to burn, accidentally pinched her arm and the pain was more than expected and it left a bruise. On 12Mar2021, patient experienced sinus issues. On 20Mar2021, patient experienced that her legs were heavy and felt like they were weighted, which made it difficult for her to walk. On 22Mar2021, patient experienced burning pain on her lower lips, specifically in the space between the lip and the teeth. There was also burning pain in the face, in the arm and her neck-chest area, which caused great mental distress, a huge emotional toll, specifically being upset and devastated, lack of sleep, and weight lost due to lost of appetite with 5 pounds being lost within 2 weeks of these side effects. On an unspecified date in 2021, patient experienced hypersensitivity reaction. Patient stated that when she was changing her outfit she accidentally pinched her arm and the pain was more than expected and it left a bruise. About 7 hours after, she noticed that her mouth started to burn. She mentioned that she also had pineapple that day and was not sure if it was caused by the vaccine. On the 09Mar2021, she consulted a nurse practitioner who said that the burning may have been caused by the Pineapple. On 10Mar2021, she consulted her allergologist and got tested for a pineapple allergy. The results came in on 15Mar2021 and they came back negative for the allergy, but her allergologist mentioned that pineapple can still irritate the mouth. On 18Mar2021, she consulted with her Primary in which she was given magic mouthwash that made it worse. She was made to continue her benadryl and aspirin spray. On 20Mar2021, that Saturday night, as she was walking, she felt that her legs were heavy and felt like they were weighted, which made it difficult for her to walk. It lasted for about 20-30 minutes before subsiding. Last Monday, 22Mar2021 she really started to notice the burning pain on her lower lips, specifically in the space between the lip and the teeth. There was also burning pain in the face, in the arm and her neck-chest area. She described it as not constant but comes and goes. On 25Mar2021, she consulted with her primary again in which she was recommended not to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine and her side effects lean to a more neurologic cause. The doctor mentioned that the vaccine was still too new. These side effects has caused great mental distress, a huge emotional toll, specifically being upset and devastated, lack of sleep, and weight lost due to lost of appetite with 5 pounds being lost within 2 weeks of these side effects. She said that has not been fun. it has been horrible, and she would choose dying over this burning sensation in the mouth. Patient visited physician Office, 3 times and allergist did it virtually. Reportedly, after eating dinner she was eating pineapple from a can. She had the can and tried it. She had not had pineapple in a long time. While sitting in her recliner, she experienced her mouth burning. She added that began about an hour and a half after eating the pineapple and it has lasted for approximately 2 weeks. It was not constant all the time. She did not know at the time if the burning in the mouth was related to the pineapple. Caller added they thought it was the pineapple causing this. Last Sunday, the caller indicated that it was leaving and going away. Caller saw her new primary medical doctor on 09Mar2021. The Nurse Practitioner said it was probably the pineapple, She started her on Benadryl. Manufacturer was unknown to caller. Caller took 2 tablets on 09Mar2021 and stopped taking it on 10Mar2021. She restarted taking the Benadryl on about 14Mar2021. Caller stated she was primarily calling and asking because on Monday, 22Mar2021 she started having burning in her face and had burning in her arm.  Caller reported the burning in her arm was not from the vaccine and she thought it was caused by her blood pressure cuff.  Caller took her own blood pressure. Burning was better today, she still had burning in her arm. She took Zyrtec as instructed by her physician twice a day. She took a half tablet on 10Mar2021 through 13Mar2021. She was taking half a tablet in the morning and a half tablet at bedtime. Caller added that the Zyrtec made her feel unsteady and it made her sleepy. She did not tolerate it. Dose was 10mg. She has recovered completely from unsteady and being sleepy with Zyrtec. Caller took Tylenol because she was having sinus issues. She did not have the manufacturer, she took it on 12 and 20, two times. Its 325mg, by mouth, the regular strength. Caller saw an allergist on 10Mar2021 who tested her for pineapple allergy. The Allergist called on 15Mar2021 and reported she was not allergic to pineapple. Allergy was also tested for egg white, milk, wheat, corn, peanut, soybean, potato, yeast, and tomato. All resulted as negative. Benadryl: took 2 times in 09Mar2021. Caller restarted Benadryl and took it on 14Mar2021-17Mar2021. These days she only took it in the evening. She took 25 mg at night. Then she took Flonase, twice, on the 17th and 18th. Its over the counter. Lot number: TE8G, caller doesnt have box to provide UPC, stated there was another number of 0140592, expiry Mar2021. Dose was 27.5mcg per spray, spray into each nostril. When providing strength, states writing was so small for her to see. Gets a magnifying glass to confirm strength, states it&#39;s with her age. The doctor also suggested for the caller to try Afrin spray on 18Mar2021.  Caller started it on 20Mar2021 and used it only once. She didnt like it. Caller said at her age she occasionally breaks out and uses Clindamycin for that. Dermatologist has her using Clindamycin 1 per cent pledgets. Applied twice to face once daily, She stopped 20Mar2021. Given Magic Mouthwash, which was in a pharmacy bottle, she took it once on 18Mar2021, but stopped. It was 5-10ml swish and spit. It made things worse and did not improve it. The doctor forgot to give her a measuring cup, and caller thought she told her a teaspoon. Caller added she tried using a warm cloth on her sinus area and her skin felt like a sunburn. The cloth left a red area around her cheek. Then this Sunday, after using the pledgets, went for a walk, next day noticed her face was really burned, not just face, her neck, arms, but she was not exposed, but had a burning pain, and she still continued to have it.  She asked the dermatologist if this could be caused from the Clindamycin. The dermatologist told her no. She took a walk on Saturday and did not know if she was dehydrated.  She felt like there were weights on her feet as she walked. It lasted 30 minutes. The burning in mouth started 7 hours after the first dose and it had improved. Therapeutic measures taken in response to the events included Benadryl, Zyrtec, Tylenol, Flonase, Afrin spray, clindamycin, magic mouthwash. Outcome of the events &#34;mouth started to burn/burning in mouth&#34; and &#34;sinus issues&#34; were ongoing-not recovered and for all other events were unknown at the time of report.

After being in COVID isolation for 24 hours, I saw her in a hospital bed and she looked like a corpse.   The initial diagnosis was severe Sepsis with liver, kidney and heart problems and blood clots in both lungs.  She had never had any of this before getting the Pfizer vaccine.  Her WBC count was also very high.   She was hospitalized for 10 days and then sent to a rehab facility for 14 days before returning to her independent living facility.   She is now taking blood thinners for the blood clots which she didn&#39;t have prior to taking the vaccine.  He did a miracle in sparing her life!

                                                Well like I said, I woke up and my arm after the shot was sore. The joint was bothering me, and I thought that it was a side effect of the shot and after about a week I had a little bit of movement but still pain. So later in May I finally called the orthopedic doctor. I got an MRI and he said it was a significant tear to the rotator cuff. I did not do anything so I do not know what or how it happened. I just figured it was the COVID vaccine, although the doctor thought it was highly unlikely. I had surgery to repair it on May the 20th 2021, at local hospital. I came home that night after the surgery. The doctor gave me tramadol for the pain as well. I will have another MRI next week, in mid-July 2021.

An 80-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via unspecified route of administration, on right arm, on 14Jan2021 15:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

On 15Jan2021, patient had a 101F fever, a headache and chills all day. Her concern was that she had never had any kind of reaction to any kind of vaccine before. From what she&#39;s heard, people have had a worse reaction to the 2nd shot, and since the first shot was so bad she was worried about getting the 2nd one. She was scheduled for her 2nd dose on 02Feb2021, and she had an appointment scheduled with a specialist on 03Feb2021. The morning after getting the vaccine, she woke up and got dressed but kept thinking that she was cold so she put on an extra sweater. Stated that even with the extra sweater on, she still had the chills, then she started to get the headache, and then she took her temperature. Stated that she had also had a sore arm, it&#39;s finally starting to feel better today. The outcome of event sore arm was resolving, outcome of other events were resolved on 16Jan2021.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and previously took the flu shot one time and started having right arm pain across her chest over to the left side right after getting it. So she don&#39;t take it anymore and takes a bunch of herbs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she has a disease, amyloidosis on an unspecified date, where there is a build up of protein in the body. She didn&#39;t know that there is protein in the shot and doesn&#39;t know the affects it has with her condition. She found out the day after getting the first Pfizer C-19 (clarified as COVID-19) shot that there was protein in it. The patient wanted to know the affects it has with her condition and if it will affect her getting the second dose and if it covers the new virus and booster shot. The patient got the vaccine on 16Jan2021 and found out about the protein in it the next day when it came across her phone. The patient received it at a school, where they vaccinated 1,169 residents. They text her to inform her she could get the vaccine. They also have the health department there. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient took 1 Tylenol about 15:00 that afternoon and seated herself in the chair about 17:45, then she felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head. She stood up and walked around to see if she was going to faint and she did not faint. She walked through the house and nothing else happened. The patient mentioned that her eyes have been swollen and her hands hurt, that&#39;s where the protein build up comes in the body. Has pings up and down her legs, they are sharp pings that lasted through on to Tuesday. She took 1 Advil to help and as of yesterday (as reported) no pings. Her hands still hurt, because this condition forms chains in the body and the chains are around the hands like carpel tunnel. The protein normally should leave the body and with this condition it doesn&#39;t and it leaves chains. When she was diagnosed with it they took a spot off the ankle to test it, the Dermatologist did and sent it off. No further details provided. Wants to know the affects of her getting the second shot. No further details provided. The outcome of the events amyloidosis and hands hurt was not recovered, the events felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head and sharp pings up and down legs was recovering, and the event  eyes swollen was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot: EL8982) intramuscular in right arm on 22Jan2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Gastroparesis from 2016 and ongoing, ongoing Osteoarthritis (diagnosed about 10 to 20 years before), acid reflux (esophageal), blood pressure, osteoporosis, arthritis, anxiety, high cholesterol, stomach problems, allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, leg cramps at night, allergic to all kind of bites. Patient previously took shingles vaccine as immunization and she had had a small reaction, she had a patch of shingles break out around her arm at the site of injection site. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for Gastroparesis, ongoing erythromycin, ongoing aluminum hydroxide/magnesium carbonate (GAVISCON) for acid reflux (esophageal), ongoing calcium for Osteoporosis, ongoing losartan for Blood pressure, ongoing acetaminophen for arthritis, ongoing spironolactone as diuretic, ongoing tramadol for Osteoarthritis, vitamin C [ascorbic acid] as general supplementation, ongoing alprazolam for Anxiety, ongoing doxazosin for high blood pressure, ongoing fenofibrate for High cholesterol, ongoing vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX) as general supplementation, ongoing bisoprolol for high blood pressure, ongoing magnesium good for heart recommended by cardiologist, ongoing biotin for hair and nails, ongoing zinc as immunity booster, ongoing montelukast sodium for allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, ongoing levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) for allergies, ongoing cyclobenzaprine for leg cramps at night as muscle relaxer, ongoing macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) as laxative and ongoing &#34;CVS brand multivitamin at one tablet once a day oral as general supplementation&#34; (as reported).The patient experienced face felt hot and flushed and face red on 24Jan2021; gray spot on forehead on 25Jan2021; was tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot, face was burning and burned bright red face feeling sunburned in Jan2021.Events were described as follows: patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and she had a few mild symptoms. She did not feel really good for a day or two but it was nothing that alarmed her, she was tired and wiped out. She always took a shower since she had arthritis and it get gets her joints going. On 24Jan2021 after she got out of the shower, her face felt hot and it was red. She didn&#39;t think too much about it and it went away pretty soon. She did not connect it with the vaccine. On 25Jan2021 she took a little longer shower and the same thing happened, but it was 10 or 12 times worse in regards to her face feeling hot and was red. She was drying off and getting dressed and reported her face felt funny and it was really hot. When she looked at it was bright red like she had the worst sunburn, it felt like a sunburn. Her face was red and eyes were red bloodshot and it lasted about half an hour; her face got real flushed like a real bright sunburn and her face was burning and burned bright red. She started putting on cold wet wash cloths to help cool her face down and when it the wash cloths got warm, she would wet it again to cool her face down some more. She was alarmed but about 30 minutes later it started lightening up a bit and pretty soon it was back to normal. Her face felt different in the afternoon, it was a little red. She worked out in yard and last summer she got an insect bite on her forehead that turned gray, it was the size of silver dollar. After the hot flush thing this morning, that gray spot came back. Her doctor said it might take a while for it to go away. Her face felt warm like it has been sunburned. Her throat was dry since she has been waiting on the phone for an hour. Her face feeling sunburned/hot was about 95% gone, barely there. Her face getting red started on 24Jan2021 morning and it was almost gone. Treatment included ponds face cream and it was very soothing. Patient just wanted to know what to do about this flushing of her face and if it was dangerous what she can  do. She would like to know if she should be worried about this, it only happened when she took a shower. She was asking if there was anything she can do before she can get the second injection, so it does not happen again or what to do if it does happen again. Final outcome of tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot and face was burning and burned bright red/her face feeling sunburned/ face got really like the worst sunburn was unknown; outcome of the other events was not recovered.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

                                                I am reporting that I was diagnosed with  shingles after 2 wks of getting my 1st dose of Covid vaccine shot in my upper left arm.  My arm starting hurting &amp; a few days later, I broke out with tiny dark red spots inside a red swollen circle.  Arm remained with a burning aching pain. My dermatologist said it was definately shingles &amp; prescribed a 10 day treatment of antiviral medication.  She didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine but  should report this.   The shingles are just below the shot area.

                                                Asthma attack began about 20 minutes after injection, with throat tightening, slight mouth swelling sensation and immediate wheezing which grew progressively worse.  I had my inhalers (Levalbuterol and Flovent) with me, used Levalbuterol at the direction of medical people who surrounded me after I reported wheezing.  They gave me a Benadryl, then brought a wheel chair and sent me directly to the ER.  I was there about 3 hours during which I had a heart monitor,  a &#34;breathing treatment&#34; by a respiratory therapist, and DUONEB, famotidine (PEPCID), and (DELTASONE). I was given a 3 day Rx for 20 mg. of prednisone, and released.  My lungs felt &#34;twitchy&#34; the next day and my voice was muted, but was well otherwise.   The only &#34;normal&#34; side effect I had was some soreness at the injection site for a couple of days, with some light sensitivity there for a few weeks.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EN6200) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies, hip surgery, and foot surgery three times. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. Patient reported she has been so sick. She got the shot on Monday 15Feb2021, and that same day she got so sick, it was horrible. Patient had chills, fever, aches and pains, and if someone named it, it was there. She stated that before Monday she was 183 pounds, didn&#39;t know if it has changed as she has not been on a scale, but she was sure it has because hasn&#39;t eaten since Monday, as she has had no appetite. Her appointment was at 07:45, and she went right when she got up, so she did not really have anything to eat on Monday. Patient stated that on Tuesday, she did not eat anything until the evening when she had one piece of pizza. Today, patient has only had a yogurt. Today was the first time she has gotten out of bed and even felt like getting dressed and putting her contacts in, since Monday. The last few days, patient stated that after getting up and going to the bathroom she would walk downstairs and felt weak as a kitten (15Jan2021). Patient stated that she was at least 80% better, because she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door (Feb2021), and she was not a wimp, it was just horrible. Patient mentioned that she was on a lot of medicine, probably 10, but this was the first time she was receiving this vaccine. She stated that she was still having pain where the injection occurred (Feb2021), like when her shirt touches it, she can tell it was there. But patient stated that she had the nicest nurse and the injection itself did not hurt, it was just later, and the injection site got swollen (Feb2021). Outcome of the event she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door, chills, fever, aches and pains, felt weak as a kitten was recovering; no appetite was not recovered; while the other events was unknown.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

Medical history included, broke her elbow from 04Dec2020 and surgery from 12Dec2019 and second surgery was from 15Jul2020; the patient thought that the second surgery on her arm was in 2020 and she actually broke her arm in 2019. She thinks it was actually Dec2019 when she broke her arm and the second surgery was on 15Jul2020; ongoing with the arm the pain and movement in that arm (movement disorder) and arm; weakened (same arm that she broke).

She experienced some side effects, there was joint pain on 15Feb202 later that nigh and the most obvious thing was exhaustion that began later the same day as well; but one thing was unusual, the strange side effect that has happened on 16Feb2021 was that her hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy but it was much better now, it was the same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before. The patient stated that the main thing was the neuropathy thing, it felt like she was sitting on her hand and that persisted, but it was 90 percent better and she thinks it will go away. The neuropathy feeling was ongoing but much less, it was improved it happens only if she squeezes her hand so it was much less and she hoped it just dissipates. The patient&#39;s main concern was the neuropathy and it has improved a great deal. The patient mentioned with the arm the pain and movement in that arm has worsened since the injection (Feb2021). The worsened pain and movement has persisted about the same since she noticed it. The patient informed that was the joint she guessed, because she broke the elbow.

The patient basically is maintained in the nursing home in this state of being bed-bound and nonverbal.  She was recently transferred to Rehab after she developed a stage IV sacral ulcer at a previous nursing home.  The patient had been seeing wound care and doing very well.  Her stage IV sacral ulcer had been healed to a stage II.  She had been gaining weight.  Unfortunately, at her wound care appointment yesterday the wound had decompensated a little bit and had started to drain some purulent material.  It also enlarged in size a little bit.  I was called yesterday afternoon and the nursing home reported the patient was not wanting to eat or drink.  Lab work showed a sodium of 170 and creatinine consistent with acute kidney injury.  She also appeared to have a urinary tract infection.  Because of her critical labs she was sent to the nursing home.  The patient was evaluated in the nursing home and then admitted to the floor.  She was given Zosyn and vancomycin and started on IV fluids.  The emergency room physician did counsel the family that the prognosis was very grim.  The patient has done reasonably well overnight.  She has been grimacing quite a bit and the family has decided they just want her kept comfortable    comfort care during admission

Then a day or two later started getting left arm rash then on to the right arm a few days later.  Don&#39;t know if rash was caused by that.  Went for 2nd shot today and rejected when I told them about fluctuation of temperatures at fist shot.  How can I get second shot??

An 80-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284) on left arm, intramuscular on 02Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pancreatic cancer stage IV metastasized, blood pressure (abnormal) and chemo. Concomitant medication included pancreatin (CREON) for pancreatic enzymes. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a side effect and it&#39;s so weird, she was a cancer patient she was in (city, state) and she had her first Covid vaccine on 12Jan2021 and she had her second one on 02Feb2021 and not a reaction until yesterday (06Feb2021) her left arm got a red rash, all the way up and down her shoulder to mid way between her elbow and hand and some swelling and she just wanted to make sure. She did look at the sheet and it does say you can get a rash, she has no temperature and she wanted to make sure that&#39;s a part of it all. When clarified if the retired registered nurse wanted to if it was the side effects from Covid vaccine, she stated, she guessed so because she got it on Tuesday and her arm hurt a little bit (Feb2021) but no rash showed up until yesterday which was Saturday. The patient had blood work done last Monday on 01Feb2021 with unknown results. The patient reported that she knows her white count was low (unspecified date) because they could give her chemo, so she actually has blood work on Monday 01Feb2021. Treatment was not received and patient stated, it just showed up yesterday and her nurse told her not to put anything on it. The outcome of the events was unknown.

They admitted me to Emergency because my blood pressure was extremely high-they said later it was about 187/ ?.  While I was there the blood pressure went up over 200 to 214/81.  I was dizzy and nausious and shaking because I became very cold even though the nurse covered me with 3 blankets.  After I left the hospital it took until after I got a prescription for meclizine filled and took one at 7PM before I was able to get the blood pressure down to a normal range - 130/64.  Today I am still taking meclizine as prescribed and am still slightly dizzy.  I do not know if this was related to the vaccine or not.

                                                sore right arm; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program. Contactable consumers (including the patient) reported that an 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EK4176, expiration date: Mar2021) intramuscular on the right arm on 21Jan2021 14:00 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. She had the first shot. She was going for the second shot on Thursday. She had a sore right arm on Jan2021, so she took ibuprofen (ADVIL) and she was hoping she did not ruin the fact that she had the first shot. The Advil took the soreness away and she has not had any problems since. The soreness started late in the evening when she went to bed around 11:30 or 12 and that was when she took Advil. The sore arm recovered the next day. She heard rumors from people that people should not take Advil or Tylenol after receiving the shot. She asks if this was true. She is asking if she can take Advil for her second dose. The events did not require a visit to physician office or Emergency Room. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a convention center. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the event was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

An 80-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8733), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Apr2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. Consumer stated, &#34;What happened when I came home exactly at 1:50, I had it exactly at 5:15. I thought somebody shot me in the head. I had the TV remote in my hand, and it felt like somebody hit me on the head and remote went flying across the room and on to the floor. That was the first time and a half hour later it happened again I had a teaspoon in my hand at the dinner table, my body jerked and that went across the room than it happened two more times. I had nothing in my hand. But I jerked in my body, body jerked and a violent headache for 6 days now. I have had MRI of the head and I have to see if my neurologist, but he cannot see me till the 30Apr2021.&#34; Lab work: Consumer stated, &#34;I went and had the MRI.&#34; When asked for any other help, consumer stated, &#34;No, but I still don&#39;t know. I still have to go to my neurologist and my artery doctor because they said my arteries in my head on that side is narrowing, were narrowed. So, I am in for a long holiday. I had to go to a lot of doctors to figure out what they are going to do, and I am sleeping a lot, there is something wrong. I just want Pfizer to know just something not right with that. If you want also my husband but he came with me and he had shot with me. He had headache for five days but nothing else just the headache for 5 days from the same LOT.&#34; On 21Apr2021, information due to 2nd shot of Pfizer was again reported. She had a reaction 4 hours after that shot, kind of like a seizure, she had a TV remote in my hand and out of nowhere it when flying out of my hand across the table and onto the floor, this result happened 4 times within two hours that same day. Have had headache for 16 days since. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: unknown result on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Then on Saturday morning she noticed that there was a red circle light pink circle on her upper arm, about in the area of the injection.  Then over the next few days it got hot to touch, and the redness slowly started to spread.  Right now it has spread down to the inside of her upper left arm, and is very itchy.  She looked for a bug bite but has not seen one.  She called her pharmacist yesterday and he suggested that this often happens with this particular reaction to that vaccine and told her to take Benadryl and to put cortisone cream on that area, but the area is still hot to touch, red, itchy and hurting.

Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was the first dose of Pfizer COVID Vaccine (Batch/lot number: EL9267) on 18Feb2021 at age of 80-year-old administered in right arm and no adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient reported she had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine, she fell on 11Mar2021, not fainted.

She passed out and didn&#39;t remember falling or feeling anything before falling. The patient also has a primary physician, but she had been seeing the plastic surgeon for this. The patient asked what does she do if she needs to get a booster. It scared her to death if she would have to take another shot. The patient asked (name) to hand her a pair of glasses to read the plastic surgeons name. She stated the printing is so small on there. She was supposed to see the doctor on 19Apr2021, but she didn&#39;t feel good enough to go see the doctor. For busted Mouth, they put in 3 layers of stitches.

It made it awkward to get in and out of bed when she can&#39;t use her left arm or her right knee. Her left shoulder was really bothering her and she may have to go have some more work done. It has been popping and went in and out of the joint. That would be back with her primary doctor. Sore pinky on left hand had recovered it didn&#39;t stay that long. Black left eye, it was black and blue purple green and yellow. It cleared up in the last couple of days. She was lucky she didn&#39;t break the bone around her eye.

Three days after that, on 1/29/2021, I became quite ill.  I had sudden onset of total body weakness, I was unable to sleep for 4 days, I developed a constant frontal headache, I felt like my body was electrified, my eyes started twitching and feeling like my eyelids were being pulled, my face felt like it was being pulled on one side, my nose became runny and hasn&#39;t stopped.   To this day I have no energy and am not like my old self before the shot.  I have gone downhill incredibly fast.  My doctors don&#39;t know what to do with me and I don&#39;t think things are going to get better.  My day to day life is a struggle.  I have no energy to do things.    One of the only things I have not had is a fever.    My eye doctor told me he thinks I had a GROSS IMMUNE SYSTEM REACTION to the vaccine.   0 I would appreciate it if there is anything you can do to help me.    Thank you,

                                                The morning after Mom&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer shot, Dad woke up and found Mom lying on the floor next to the bed.  Mom said, &#34;I can&#39;t move my arm.&#34; Dad called paramedics who checked her.  They said her vital signs were normal and left.  On 2/9/21 in the morning my da awoke to see that Mom had large amounts of bubbly saliva pouring from her mouth onto her pillow.  Dad called paramedics, who said this was a diabetic reaction.  Mom had NEVER had anything happen like this before.  Mom was very sleepy, could not be aroused, and made only gurgling noises.  She was admitted to the hospital for care and therapy.  She pulled her own IV out.  Mom had to be restrained in the hospital and sedated, due to confusion and worsening dementia.  By 2/18 when we spoke by phone mom&#39;s speech was abnormally slow and very repetitive.  &#34;I&#39;m very tired today&#34; was spoken many times.  In morning time mom was able to follow basic conversation.  Not so later in the day.  Mom came home from rehab on 2/26/21.  She was able to walk steadily and independently at home after her therapy.  After a week or so, Mom began hitting the in-home caregiver.  Dad&#39;s presence would calm her.  In a short time Mom seemed not to know dad anymore, and would hit him and the caregiver when they helped her.  She also pulled all covers off the bed and pulled clothes out of the closet, throwing them all over the room during the night.  Mom was usually walking around the house during each night.  On 4/16/21 Mom and dad were napping sitting up on the couch in the morning.  Mom fell forward and hit her head on the hearth.  Dad and caregiver gave first aid and called paramedics, who took her to the ER.  Mom came home on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 Mom pulled her catheter out in the early morning.  In the afternoon Mom&#39;s appearance was concerning, so Dad called paramedics.  They said that Mom&#39;s BP had dropped very low and took her to the ER. Mom was combative the next day in the hospital.  Dr. adjusted her medications periodically to ensure that mom&#39;s care would be manageable when she would eventually be sent home.  Minimal therapy was done due to dementia.  By 5/3/21 doctor said that Mom is bed bound and needing total care.  Her blood sugar spiked high despite special diet.  Staff waiting for insulin order from doctor.  5/4/21 Doctor called Dad to say that Mom had died during the night.

                                                shingles; rash on right inner thigh; leg was painful and tender to the touch; didn&#39;t sleep well; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (reporting for herself) via the medical information team. An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6203; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included surgery in the fall for cervical disc and cholesterol. Concomitant medication included simvastatin taken for cholesterol, start and stop date were not reported. On 25Feb2021 (reported as &#34;the next day&#34;), the patient noticed on her inner right thigh it felt like a rash but there was nothing there, but it felt like there was. The leg was painful and tender to the touch. The patient also didn&#39;t sleep well and talked to someone on 27Feb2021 (reported as Saturday) and said it sounds like shingles to them. The patient talked to the doctor and they felt like it was shingles. The doctor put the patient on medication which has really helped a lot. The rash was not getting worse, it has just stayed a little better and the same. The doctor prescribed her prednisone and valacyclovir, 1mg three times a day. The rash seemed to get worse in the evening, it was painful all around her leg, she thought it was a blood clot, but then realized no because the pain was on the outside it doesn&#39;t feel like it was on the inside. The rash wasn&#39;t red, Friday late afternoon it started being raised. The pain in her leg was sensitive but not like it was. The patient has kept her leg covered, its impossible to do this because of where it was on her leg. The pain was worse Friday night, the patient was able to sleep Saturday night, it was still sensitive. The outcome of the event didn&#39;t sleep well was recovered on 27Feb2021 while the outcome of the other events were recovering.

An 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid right on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as unknown, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter stated that since then (having both doses of the vaccine), she has been to the emergency room 4 different times experiencing side effects. She has a metallic taste and horrible smell that she experienced in which it made her not want to eat or drink. She has minor hallucinations, chills, joint pain, and her tissue is tender. Her joint pain has improved. Then stated, &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to die from it.&#34; She asked if anyone has reported these reactions previously and what should she do about them. Her family physician&#39;s nurse looked up a study in which 11% of the patients were experiencing a metallic taste. Also stated, &#34;This is very discouraging and depressing.&#34; The outcome of the event joint pain was recovering while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of minor hallucinations cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 80-year-old (currently she just turned 81-year-old) female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 03Feb2021 3:20 PM (Batch/Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose at the age of 80-year-old for covid-19 immunisation, as care provider for her husband, administered at a COVID vaccine clinic setup.  Medical history, family medical history and concomitant medications were none. She has been very healthy.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included in 2021: haemoglobin: low, platelet count: 760   higher than normal at 760, red blood cell count: low , weight: 120lbs. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The course of events was as follows: After she got the first dose she had some adverse reactions in 2021: she had pain all over body, chest pain, leg pain, severe pain on her neck, that she couldn&#39;t lift her head. She has seen some specialists to seek assistance, she has seen a hematologist, and a rheumatologist. She has been on steroids and she was not yet done with the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Her doctor was very aware. When this started 3 months before, she 110 lbs but she has been taking steroids and her weight has shot up like crazy now she is 120 lbs, she told her doctor that she had no more fat clothes she will have to get off of the steroids, they blame everything on steroids.

                                                Patient is an 80 y/o right handed female who is totally independent at baseline who received her Pfizer vaccine out of the country (1st dose 2/19/21, 2nd dose 3/12/21).  She was reactive to both shots, reporting arthralgias, headache, low grade fever, chills. She had a rise in blood pressure later during the day of her shot as well as the next day (up to 180/70, from baseline of 130/70). She also had an episode of epistaxis several days after her first shot.  She traveled independently out of the country on 3/31/21 to visit her son on a leisure trip. On 4/5/21 she had headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, and did not feel well, and her systolic BP was 198, after which she took additional 40 mg of lisinopril.   Her BP subsequently decreased to systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on 4/5/21, but over the next few days she had labile BP with a range of BP of 125 to 171/ 58 - 68.  She was meticulous in checking and recording her BP several times a day, and she increased her lisinopril dose to 40 mg po qd from 20 mg po qd given the higher than usual blood pressure range.  On 4/10/21 her BP was as follows: 6:30 am, 148/60 (she took her daily lisinopril 20 mg po); 11:30 am:  132/52; 3 pm: 171/69 (she took additional lisinopril 20 mg po) after which her systolic BP decreased to 130. Then around 6:20 pm the same day (4/10/21), she had acute onset of headache, vomiting, left sided weakness, SBP 220, and was witnessed to have rapid change in mental status. There was no antecedent trauma to the head. EMTs were called immediately and she had loss of consciousness during the ambulance ride to the ED, after about 20 minutes of symptom onset, with agonal breathing and bradycardia to the 40s, but never lost her pulse. Upon arrival to the ED out of the country, her Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, she was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Head CT demonstrated massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage (140 cc) within the R temporal parietal and occipital lobes, with cerebral edema and 14 mm midline shift, associated with small subdural hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage within the temporal horn and body of the R lateral ventricle. They reported hyperdense &#34;spot sign&#34; within the intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with active hemorrhage, no evidence of venous thrombosis, no masses, no arteriovenous malformations. She had 2.5 mm aneurysm right  that was thought to be incidental finding unrelated to her event. She was taken emergently to the OR on 4/10/2021 for decompressive R hemicraniectomy, which she underwent successfully with minimal blood loss.  She had no coagulopathy and her platelets and hemoglobin were normal. She remained in the Neuro ICU for 3 weeks. She received a tracheostomy two weeks after her presentation, and was weaned off the ventilator. She is breathing spontaneously after 5 weeks from presentation. She remains in coma or minimally conscious state, with GCS score of 5-6 as of 5/13/2021.

An 80-year-old female patient (Weight: 53.52 kg, Height: 157 cm) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Feb2021 08:30 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. She is unable to clearly identify the Lot due to illegible handwriting on the vaccine card. She thinks it is EN6200 or EN06200. Vaccination Facility Type: Clinic sponsored by (Name). Vaccine not administered at Military Facility. Medical history included covid-19 from 2020. She was also told that she might not need to get the second dose because of having antibodies. When she had Covid it was mild. She did not have the traditional symptoms. It affected her gastrointestinal system more. It was weird. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. There were no concomitant medications. On 26Feb2021, after she got the vaccine, her arm was killing her. It was awful. She took Tylenol for it. Around 3-4pm she was feeling a little bit weird/&#34;felt a little funny&#34; like she was unsteady on her feet. She was not dizzy. She woke up the next day, 27Feb2021, felt &#34;rotten&#34;, &#34;almost like I felt when I had covid/ felt like she had Covid. Same symptoms, milder form&#34;: slight headache for 3 hours, chills lasted a couple of hours, temperature of 99.6-100.1F for 3 hours. She was awful in the morning and better as the day went on. It remined her of when she had Covid. After symptoms went away, she still felt a little tired. Didn&#39;t feel as good as she did before the day she took the vaccine. Caller said the vaccination Nurse told her that she might have more reaction because she may still have antibodies. Caller asking did she need to get 2nd dose? Should she expect reactions from the second dose? She still plans on taking it. The outcome of arm was killing her was recovering. Her arm is better but if she lays on her arm she can still feel it. The outcome of felt a little tired was unknown. The patient was recovered from other events on 27Feb2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

ED to Hosp-Admission Discharged  5/28/2021 - 6/2/2021 (5 days) Hospital  MD Last attending ? Treatment team Lacunar stroke  Principal problem    HPI: 80-year-old lady admitted with left-sided weakness     Hospital Course: Patient was admitted with left-sided weakness.  MRI showed a 9 x 8 mm acute lacunar infarction in the right thalamus.  This was the likely cause of the patient&#39;s left-sided weakness.  Patient has asymptomatic COVID-19 infection diagnosed May 13.  The stroke may have been a late effect of a hypercoagulable state induced by COVID-19.  In any case the patient&#39;s deficits rapidly resolved and by the day of discharge she was at her baseline.  She had no difficulty walking or functioning.  She was seen by physical and Occupational Therapy who felt that she was safe to go home.   To prevent this from happening in the future we are increasing her atorvastatin from 20 mg to 40 mg daily.  She is already on warfarin.  She was seen by the neurology service and they did not recommend making any other changes especially in view of the patient&#39;s history of gastrointestinal bleeding.  On the day of discharge she was feeling very good and eager to go home.  I think this is reasonable.

                                                pruritis/itching all over; she is still tingling around her shoulders and neck; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reported for herself. An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection Batch/Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 13:30, as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure, ongoing cholesterol, and ongoing acid reflux. Concomitant medications included algeldrate, alginic acid, magnesium trisilicate, sodium bicarbonate (GAVISCON [ALGELDRATE; ALGINIC ACID; MAGNESIUM TRISILICATE; SODIUM BICARBONATE]); esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM [ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM]) taken as Antacid; vitamin d nos (VITAMIN D NOS); vitamin A; and blood pressure medicine (unspecified). On 20Feb2021 (Saturday), the patient got the first dose 20Feb2021 and the itching started after midnight. On 21Feb2021 at 02:00 AM, she experienced itching all-over, but it had diminished and was now on her shoulder and neck area. She noticed, it got worse after she has taken her reflux medication Nexium and Gaviscon and wanted to know the expected duration of this side effect. She mentioned that she had vaccine, Saturday at about 1:30 PM it was reported that it went fine but at about 2 AM she woke up itching and she didn&#39;t think anything about it and thought it would go way but continued and it gets worse when she takes her antacid. She quit taking her Nexium, it got worse with that antacid. It was a little better, but on an unspecified date in 2021, she was still tingling around her shoulders and neck and wanted to report it, but she also wanted to see how long she might have this problem or when would it go away finally. As her itching started after midnight and was fine until then which was why she thought it was something to do with her acid reflux medicine because she took it before she went to bed and then yesterday, she took Gaviscon, and the itching got worse. She says it was like Pepcid or something like that, it was an antacid. She also took her prescribed medication for acid reflux. It was improved but it was still there. Further she added that it was not like she itches and scratches all the time, but it was just there, mainly around shoulders and neck. She was startled she had any reaction because she did not right at first but might be people should know that you still could have a reaction. She took the Nexium that night before and she had taken all her medicines as well which was her blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine, Nexium, vitamin D and A vitamin. She had taken all of those the night she started itching. Last night all she took was her blood pressure medicine. She also had taken Tylenol and when she started itching like when it was bad, she took some, it was like allergy relief like Zyrtec (generic). Last night all she took was blood pressure medicine because she did not want to mess with anything. She had not taken any antacid since about 12 yesterday morning and the itching got worse than that was why she was thinking maybe that was the problem. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events with Tylenol and Zyrtec. The outcome of the event pruritis/itching all over was resolving, while the outcome of the other event was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible, no further information is expected.

She later provided that Penicillin gave her hives so bad. She was loaded with hives and was a pimply mess. She also said that Doxycycline gave her severe diarrhea. She then found her list and also provided allergies to the following: Tetracycline, Arithromycin, Sulfa, Levaquin, Ceftin, Zithromax, and no contrast Iodine. She does not remember the exact reaction. It is either severe hives or severe diarrhea. She does not have the lot or expiration for any of them. No further details provided. She had another issues immediately after the shot. She had funny bone pain in the right arm but she got the shot in the left arm. This pain was described as a nerve pain that would go all the way up and down her right arm. It would come at night after the shot but then it went away. She does not have it right now. Right now she was trying to get rid of a UTI. It was recently within the last 2 weeks ago. She started medication for it and they did not help. She had a call into the doctor and she was still dizzy and had bad effects for the UTI. She took the medication and had to refill it. Medication was Nitrofurantoin Mono Mcr 100 mg. One capsule every 12 hours. It was in a pharmacy vial with unknown lot or expiration. She did a refill and took it twice. She finished them and has none left. Her friends were upset because she would not get second shot and certainly not a third because of these headaches. She felt she may take a chance at getting something worse than these headaches. She does not feel she should get them or anymore. The patient did not require emergency room and physician office visit. She had been to her doctor since and she mentioned the headaches, and all they say was to take Advil. Outcome of the events headache, urinary tract infection and dizzy was not recovered, whereas other events were recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

She stated the soreness began last night, in the evening on 20Jan2021. The soreness had pretty much stayed the same. She expected the soreness, but she didn&#39;t expect her toes to hurt. It was important to note &#34;she is able to able the gout&#34;. She had only had gout really bad time once and then she&#39;s had a little bit every so often. The gout just seems to be connected to the vaccine- she could not say nothing that she ate would indicate other wise. The events did not require visit Emergency Room or Physician Office. She had an appointment for 10Feb2021 to get the second COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of event glands in her neck on the right side swollen was recovering, outcome of events was not recovered.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 21Jan2021 08:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included lymphoma from 2018. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer. The patient previously took rituxan for lymphoma (Reported she had been in remission for a little over a year. She said she had received only 4 Rituxan infusions for the lymphoma before she went into remission). 12 hours post injection: she &#34;experienced significant rigors and shaking, muscle and joint aches, her equilibrium was off at some point, she was tired, had generalized pain, and chills&#34;. She also confirmed feeling better.  She stated she heard the the second dose of the vaccine caused more reaction than the first dose and would like to validate the information. She explained the first instance she experienced rigors was after a lymphoma treatment. She believed the rigors lasted &#34;12 hours&#34; but was not certain because she &#34;fell asleep and got warmed&#34;. The patient felt great all day on 21Jan2021 after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said almost exactly 12 hours later, she started to have rigors. She was shaking so hard that her hands and body were jerking. Her muscles and joints were hurting, her equilibrium was off, she ached all over, she had pain, felt tired, and she had chills. The rigors started first. She said she felt really cold at the same time, so she went to bed and covered up, trying to get warmed. She fell asleep for awhile, and then woke up and went to the bathroom. When she went to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, she stood up, and every bone and muscle in her body hurt. She said she was aching all over, and her equilibrium was off. She didn&#39;t feel like getting up, and finally went to sleep to get the rigors to stop. She felt cold all the time now, but the rest of her symptoms had improved. She said it seemed like the muscle in her right leg was still pretty sore. She said she recovered from the rigors completely. She had rigors once before when she had an infusion. She clarified the infusion was Rituxan. She said she had a reaction to her first treatment of Rituxan. She said she had rigors when the Rituxan infusion was first started. She was given a couple things (but she didn&#39;t know what those things were), and she stopped shaking. She said the infusion staff waited a few minutes and tried to restart the Rituxan infusion, but she would have rigors again. She said the infusion staff tried slowing down the Rituxan infusion rate, as well. She said the Rituxan infusion normally takes 2 hours, but after 8 hours, she had only got about 20% of the Rituxan infusion, before the Rituxan infusion was stopped. She stated she had 3 subsequent Rituxan infusions at later dates, and did not have any problems with those infusions. Her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine was administered high up in the muscle of her left arm, close to the shoulder joint. She said the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection didn&#39;t hurt, and her left arm never got sore. She said on 30Dec2020 she had lab work done for her oncologist. She went about every other month for blood work to make sure she was still in remission. She saw her oncologist on 06Jan2021, and her oncologist said her blood work looked pretty good and was better. She asked her oncologist about the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her oncologist said she definitely wanted her to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. Her next appointment with her oncologist was in Mar2021. She said she had been seeing her oncologist every month, but her oncologist this time, wanted to try seeing her after 2 months. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of events rigors, shaking was recovered in Jan2021. The outcome of events muscle and joint aches/her muscles hurt, equilibrium was off, aching all over, tired, bone and muscle in her body hurt, hands and body were jerking was recovering. The outcome of event feels cold was not recovered.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said &#34;my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down.&#34; The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated &#34;I am so allergic to medicine.&#34; She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was &#34;so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix.&#34; States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about &#34;2 pages long.&#34;  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to take the second dose and probably won&#39;t. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn&#39;t had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn&#39;t want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn&#39;t in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn&#39;t feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn&#39;t know about COVID but he hadn&#39;t heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn&#39;t feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn&#39;t know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn&#39;t think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200&#39;s for underactive thyroid, it&#39;s minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn&#39;t have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won&#39;t take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?  The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events heart was &#39;beating out of chest&#39;, &#39;head and ears closed down&#39; was recovered in Jan2021, of other events was unknown.

I couldn&#39;t turn over to the left or right when down because of the pain. It was not shortness of breath. It was pretty bad. This pain lasted about 3 weeks.  Soreness is my arm appeared the day of vaccination but that went away within 2 days.  I also kept sneezing non stop, and my nose was runny this also started about 48 hours after vaccination. It is better but not completely gone yet. The sneezing is not constant, as of today but still there.

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; manufacturer reported as Pfizer-Wyeth; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 21Jan2021 12:30 at 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis in back; always had diarrhea because she had cancer and is unable to control her bowels. They tell her she has a lot of fiber in her food; but she can&#39;t control it; if she eats vegetables then she knows what&#39;s happening; but she always tries to take Imodium A-D before eating vegetables. She mentioned to them if she did not eat vegetables all she could eat is meat and cheese; doctor told her she was borderline diabetic, so she has wanted to keep up with that. The doctor was not worried about it; ongoing acid reflux; pain; and ongoing high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for acid reflux, ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis in back, caffeine, codeine phosphate, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE) for pain, loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM A-D) for diarrhea. The patient has not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinations reported as she has gotten flu shots and pneumonia shot and has never had any adverse events, reactions or problems with those; nothing. The reporter mentioned that she got her first dose of the vaccine in a clinic on 21Jan2021 and aware that the second dose will be on 16Feb2021. The patient reported that she felt bad after taking the first dose-flu like symptoms on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and had high fever Saturday (23Jan2021), urine became yellowish-brown and wants to know more information. The patient guesses she is having an allergic reaction on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and asked for further information about the allergic reaction relative to the vaccine. On Saturday (23Jan2021), she was feeling good. She got up, went to store, came back and had little diarrhea symptoms then she began to get sick, feverish. She added that then the vomiting, then achy like flu symptoms. She still feels feverish, she has a really bitter taste, or no taste in her mouth really but it&#39;s going away. To her it seems like the worst part is over. She almost called 911 but then did not want to go the hospital because of all the people with COVID in the hospital. The next day on 24Jan2021, when she woke up, she was not as fevered. She can check her own self with her hand and it was like she put her hand on a stove. She went to sleep and the next morning (24Jan2021), she was not as feverish; her mouth still has that nasty, old bitter taste that does not go away with brushed teeth. She feels better today (unspecified date). She mentioned that the second dose is scheduled to be administered 16Feb2021, but she really does not want to go get that if she feels like this. She had blood work for her sugar done on 21Jan2021 because she is borderline diabetic, but results are unknown, have not had any results yet. The outcome of the events was recovering.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 15:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.

She applied muscle relaxant (unclear if topical) and took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and massaged her hand with warm water and then for the second time she used the muscle relaxation. She hadn&#39;t taken paracetamol yet she was waiting 4 hours but the pain was still there, it was a little bit less. Not sure if it her arthritis or side effects from vaccine but believes it was from the vaccine. Stated she used to have the same problem with her wrist arthritis (pain). Also reported that she experienced additional side effects on 08Feb2021 which lasted about 5 minutes then went away: blurry eyes; wanting to faint; dizziness, sweating (whole body started to be like sweaty). Asking for information on muscle and joint pain after the vaccine and recommendations on what to do. So far she didn&#39;t know what it was, and if it was a side effect of the arthritis, because once in a while that happens but when it happened it went away right away but this time her wrist pain was there still there. Patient sat down and now she was stretching her leg, she sat down on the chair and its gone she had no more problems. Patient said her right hand, she was very slow writing.

I returned home and within the hour I began to feel &#34;very tired&#39; and lay down in my bed.  Within minutes, my left thump had spasms and painful cramping and &#34;froze&#34; I massaged my thump for about 5 minutes and the pain subsided.  I then had painful cramping in my left calf and then the entire leg which then followed by Muscle pain and cramping in both legs.  I was told that I should exercise, so I went for a long walk.  When I returned home, i felt even worse so I went back to bed. Headaches began. I had flu-like symptoms (chills and discomfort) I covered my self with two blankets and drank lots of water and took an Aleve.which upset my stomach.  3/03 (the next morning), my usual sinus stuffiness was Gone! and I could breathe better than i have in a long time (by days end my sinusitis had returned) and so had my headache. Today 3/04 I still feel exhausted and I have swelling, puffs under my eyes (not usual) and occasional headaches.  My Left Arm (area of the inoculation) Has Never Been Painful!!!!!!

                                                She is experiencing an Allergic reaction, rash; little coughing spell; Itching eyes/My eyes started itching; Multiple hives all around her right eye; Wheezing; didn&#39;t feel comfortable; her upper lip became puffy/bottom lip began to swell; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient) via Medical Information Team. An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN6201), intramuscular at upper left arm on 21Feb2021 at 08:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included seasonal asthma, allergy to class A antihistamines that started in her 20s, facial &amp; peripheral edema, blood pressure abnormal, and celiac disease. The patient had known allergy to Benadryl and when she takes it she gets peripheral and facial edema, lip swelling, top and bottom, hives around her whole right eye. The patient also has an allergy to Class A antihistamines that started in her 20s. She said the allergy started with Seldane &amp; Claritin. She said she had giant hives with Claritin. She said she was told there were 2 classes of antihistamines &amp; she couldn&#39;t use the Class A antihistamines. She said she previously reported her Seldane, Claritin &amp; Benadryl allergies, saying she has facial &amp; peripheral edema. She said she only uses the Class B antihistamine Cimetidine now. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, omeprazole, and pravastatin. On an unspecified date, the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction, rash. On 21Feb2021, the patient experienced &#34;her upper lip became puffy/bottom lip began to swell,&#34; multiple hives all around her right eye, wheezing, and didn&#39;t feel comfortable. On 21Feb2021 at 14:00 (reported as about 2PM), the patient experienced &#34;Itching eyes/My eyes started itching.&#34; On 21Feb2021 at 21:00 (reported as 9PM), the patient experienced little coughing spell. The reporter considered the events swelling lips, itching eyes, multiple hives all around her right eye, and wheezing as serious medically significant. The patient further reported that she felt fine after the shot, her arm was not sore, nothing. She said her arm was fine, and she had no problems, whatsoever, after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has had some weird allergic reactions in the past, but no anaphylaxis. About 12:00 to 12:30 PM (also reported as around midday), the patient&#39;s lip felt puffy. She said she had ate an apple and thought maybe something was on the skin of the apple. She said then her bottom lip began to swell, so she took 3 Cimetidine (NDC Number: 49035-820-72, lot number: 9AE2576A, expiry date: Dec2020). The patient stated that she was allergic to what she believe are class A antihistamines as they gave her facial and peripheral edema including Benadryl and everything on the list. About 2PM, the patient&#39;s eyes felt itchy, she took allergy eye drops (eye drops seasonal relief with tetrahydrozoline HCL 0.05% and zinc sulfate 0.25%. She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient&#39;s lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler. She said she has been using the Serevent Diskus Inhaler for seasonal allergies for years and the inhaler works. She said she occasionally uses the Serevent Diskus for colds during the winter. She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus. NDC Number: 0173-0521-00, Lot Number: VV3E, Expiration Date: Sep2021) and Flovent (Flovent HFA 110mcg Inhaler, NDC Number: 0170719-20, Lot Number: C47A, Expiration Date: Jul2021). That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she&#39;s doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient&#39;s big concern was that she probably shouldn&#39;t get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

A 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 29Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9262) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation (Indication: Felt that getting COVID at her age would be worse than getting a possible reaction to the vaccine). Patient had an allergic reaction to the swine flu vaccine in 1979-1980. Patient had muscular problems that resulted from the Swine Flu shot. She had weakened muscle. Most of the time she was okay, but she was more prone to getting back pain and stuff, not pain on her side and on the front side like she has now. Patient wanted to know if the swine flu shot and the covid 19 vaccine had similar ingredients. The Swine Flu shot was back in 1979 or 1980. This is the only type of flu vaccination she has ever had. She did not take more after that. She does not have a lot number to provide. She does know though, that a lot of people at that time came down with (Name) from that vaccine. With this vaccine, nobody seems to be getting strong side effects from it. No Other Products. Patient History reported as No. No Investigation Assessment. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced pain in her arm statin she could not raise her arm for a day. Her arm bothered her: she could not lift her arm on 30Jan2021and recovered on 31Jan2021. The patient experienced a day later pain and inflammation on her right side of waist and in the back down in to pelvis, ovary and groin area muscle with not recovered (reported as worsened). Caller stated that it was quite painful describing the pain as muscle pain and inflammation. Caller stated that this pain had not gone away. Caller stated she was due for her second dose and wanted to know if she should get the second dose based on her side effects to the first dose. The patient was having to take anti-inflammatory medications for the pain associated with her side effects to the covid 19 vaccine. Patient thought she had a reaction to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. The day after she had the usual side effect of her arm bothering her. Then she started to experience pain and inflammation around her right side from the waist area down to the front of her pelvis to her groin muscle. It seems like pain and inflammation. It has not gone away. If patient stays home and did nothing she felt a little better. If she took an anti inflammatory she also felt a little better. If she was going out and doing something it flares up. That was why she felt it was muscular, it felt inflamed. Caller stated that it overall had gotten worse in the last few days. She was doing more things than the first couple of days. Treatment: The anti inflammatory was Diclofenac 25mg. She had also been taking Tylenol at night. She said that it does not make the pain completely go away, but it helps keep the pain tolerable. Did not have either of these medications on hand to provide the lot numbers.

                                                Pain in arm; She was slightly dizzy; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: no adverse effect. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 11Feb2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Feb2021 18:30 (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included (caller mentions she dyslexia but this was prior to the COVID vaccine). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (taking for 6-7 years) at unknown dose and frequency for an unknown indication. On an unspecified date the patient experienced pain in extremity and dizziness. Caller, reporting that she took the COVID shot and was told that if she is on a blood thinner she shouldn&#39;t have gotten the vaccine, is that true. She asks if we make Eliquis. The only small issue she had after the vaccine was some pain in her arm. She worked the pharmacy at one time. She got the shot on 10Feb2021 at 6:30pm. Treatment: Hot compress to the area. Caller remarks that just now when she stood up, she noticed she was slightly dizzy. Could that be caused by the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pain in arm (pain in extremity). The clinical outcomes of the pain in extremity and dizziness were unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible.

Often trembly with complete lack of appetite (lost 6 pound in 2 weeks). Only wanted to sit or lie down- unable to  go for daily walk (no strength).  No fever or respiratory symptoms.  This extreme condition lasted for approx. 10 weeks, during which time I saw my doctors five times for diagnosis or assistance.  They could find no reason for my sudden symptoms except for adverse reaction to the vaccine, and were unable to assist.  I mostly sat and laid around  for 10/11 weeks , after which my symptoms improved gradually, and I  am feeling better at this time.

An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration, on 27Jan2021 at 11:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization; and rosuvastatin, via an unspecified route of administration, in Feb2021 for 3 days, at an unspecified dose and frequency, for blood cholesterol. The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s husband was calling about the COVID-19 vaccine and he is not sure if what the patient was experiencing was because of the vaccine or a prescription drug (rosuvastatin) she took but her arm and legs are shaking like jerking and joints are painful on 04Feb2021. The medication the patient&#39;s husband was referring to is rosuvastatin which the patient takes for cholesterol. The patient took this for 3 days and she started feeling weird in Feb2021, so she stopped taking. The patient&#39;s husband not sure what to do since the patient went to the doctor and the doctor did not find anything, she went to the emergency room. The patient was hospitalized for two days. The patient also saw a specialist neurologist who recommended to take more tests, but the patient is waiting for the tests. In 2021, the patient had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). The patient was experiencing joint pain especially in the finger at night still (the joint pain is not in the arm and legs but in her finger). This started a few days later and was still going on. It has stayed the same and some days are better and then some days are worse. The patient was admitted to the hospital in 2021 for 2 days due to events. No treatment was received for the events. The action taken in response to the events for rosuvastatin was permanently withdrawn in Feb2021. The outcome of &#34;Feeling weird&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Joints are painful; joint pain especially in the finger&#34;. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.

                                                After the first vaccine she experienced pain in arm and pain between the eyes. She also had flu like symptoms for approximately 3 days, and unusual bowel movements not diarrhea, not constipated, but not normal and painful.  After second dose had similar reaction bowel issues are still bad and very painful (to the point of vomiting during bowel movements  due to pain). She saw her primary care doctor and was Rx&#39;d a cream.  This has caused her to decrease her eating.  This did not help and she was having loss of visual acuity and started not being able to speak properly so went to the ED  for concern over Strokes.     had 2 MRIs, and determined not to be having a stroke so was released to home.  Sxs seemed to resolve ( like a spell) .   Was still having bowel issues and she also developed a rash from the neck to the groin. So she went to a specialist.   The Rash cleared after about 3 days.   Specialist advised that the sxs were all due to the COVID Vaccine.  Flank pain under the right ribs has also been present, this is not improving,  it is a dull pain that seems to be worsening  ( the bowel seems to be about back to normal now) She is planning on speaking with her PCP about the right flank pain.

                                                She got the vaccine, and had no reactions at all other than perhaps a chill.  About  2-3 weeks later on 3/7/21 she started experiencing what they are calling muscle confusions.  She feels a tapping sensation on her biceps and triceps and then starts with muscle cramps running down her right arm creating her fingers to cringe or come together or contract.  This then travels down to her right leg to her quadriceps which cramps and convulse and travels to her calves which tighten up like a Charlie Horse and down her toes to where they contract as well.  They are intermittent, scattered and sporadic.  Sometimes she will get 2-3 a day, and then none at all and then a few days later a couple more.   These contractions last 3-5 minutes.  She had COVID back in April of 2020 and was hospitalized until August of 2020 with that.  During that time she was on a ventilator for 60 days and on a breathing tube and coded and was out for about 30 minutes.  She had an EEG of her brain in September and told that she was fine.  her neurologist felt she should have another one due to these symptoms, and she had that and everything was normal.  The doctor prescribed 500 mg twice a day of Levetiracetam.   The seizures kind of regress a little and then they came back and he upped that medication to 1000 mg twice a day.  The seizures still continue and have continued but is still taking the medication.  He felt that she should know see an epileptic specialist and they have an APT for 5/27/21.   These episodes are exhausting and wear her out.   She was going to PT due to the weakness from being in the hospital for so long, and now she is fearful if she is going to fall and uses a walker and is having a setback in that progress.  She is to continue therapy at home for now and to follow up with the Epilepsy specialist.

A 81-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 81-year-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included diabetes mellitus, blood pressure abnormal. There was no other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration. Concomitant medications included ongoing metformin taken for diabetes mellitus; lisinopril taken for blood pressure abnormal, both taking for quite a while; at least a few years.  The patient previous took first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 81-year-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on an unspecified date as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient experienced started to speak gibberish and was taken to the emergency room; out of it; combative on 06Mar2021. Caller stated she was perfectly fine and healthy prior and up to that time and the day after. Caller stated on Saturday she got up in the morning and was talking to a friend when all of a sudden something was going wrong. Caller thanked God she was at a friend&#39;s because if she had been home she would have died. Caller stated she was rushed to the ER and after 3 MRIs that confirmed that she was not having a stroke or something similar. Caller stated she spent 6 days in ICU and 2 weeks in a rehab center, went back to friends house for another week, before she went home because she was not comfortable being home by herself because she was to take her blood pressure often. Caller stated she was perfectly fine after the first shot and after the second one. It was 2 days and she had this terrible reaction and it was the only thing it can be put down to so everything else had come up normal. On 06Mar2021, caller explained she was actually getting ready to groom one of her dogs. She got up and felt fine and she was talking to her friend and another one of her friends and all of a sudden she started to talk gibberish, so her friend asked if she was having a stroke.  Her friend took the caller&#39;s blood pressure and said they were going to the hospital and her friend took her to the emergency room. Caller stated that was all she can recall. She can&#39;t remember anything after the emergency room. According to her friend, caller was out of it, getting combative, and all kinds of stuff going on. She had no recollection, she remembered getting in the car to go to the hospital, but then had no recollection. Caller stated she just went to see the doctor a week ago and got a good bill of health. The doctor said she was pretty much good; she&#39;s improved.  Caller stated her doctor told her she did not have a stroke and they did not definitively know what happened; the only thing she can put it down to was a reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome was recovering.   Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

Patient did not immediately recognize that this may have been related to the vaccination. Over the next several days, patient started experiencing additional symptoms including drooping of right side of face, drooping of right eyelid, difficulty closing right eyelid and weakness on the right side of the face.  This was unusual and on 02/10/2021, patient contacted her primary care physician who referred her immediately to Emergency Department for evaluation.  The following tests and procedures were performed by the ER: Basic Metabolic Panel, CBC Hemogram, Troponin, eGFR and CT Head w/o Contrast (reason facial drooping).  Diagnosis: Bell&#39;s Palsy, Adult.  On 2/11/21, patient had a follow-up with primary care physician.  On 02/11/2021, the patient received prednisone (10 mg once daily for 5 days) as treatment for the Bell&#39;s Palsy.  The reported events required visit to Emergency Room on 02/10/2021 with follow-up at Physician&#39;s office on 02/11/2021.  Reporting is delayed because patient understood that the adverse event had already been reported.  At a later date, patient requested a copy of the adverse event report for her records but learned that the adverse event actually had not been reported.  Report is being filed by a contactable family member.

She then developed blisters on her feet that started out small, and progressed to be huge blisters.  She now has very blotchy skin on both arms. The left foot blister were worse than the right foot that eventually burst, and  3&#34; long and 2&#34; wide.  Mainly on the big toes and third toe of both feet.  They were itchy and came very red and blotchy.  Now is very dry skin and very scaly.  She has not worn shoes for a couple of weeks due to the blisters, and is still not able to wear them still.   She saw her doctor on the 30th and he did not give her anything to take as he said that he didn&#39;t know what it was in order to treat her.  She made a FU appointment and told her if they burst and it doesn&#39;t look any worse than when he saw her then to keep on doing what she was doing.  She has been putting on triple antibiotic ointment, and keep her feet elevated.

States she retired in 2017 and had to take in 2016 and 2015, she would have lost her job if she didn&#39;t take. It had been 5-10 years before that, and another 5-10 years before that.

On April 28th2021 patient could not hear. She was deaf in right ear and the day before on April 27 it was like she woke up with pressure in both ears. It sounded like hell like she was in the airplane and by yawning she could not relieve the pressure and went to the doctor and was under treatment with steroids and antivirals and still deaf in right ear.&#34; She confirmed pressure is gone, but still deaf and under medical treatment with otolaryngology. She was kind of tossing whether to get the vaccine or not. First went to family doctor to see, didn&#39;t think she had an ear infection because no pain and was hoping maybe she would have wax in her ear, but ears were clean and no wax. So they sent her to an ear specialist and they did hearing test and she has pretty severe hearing loss in that ear. So she was still being treated. First the doctor put her on valacyclovir and methylprednisone for about 7 days and then that didn&#39;t seem to do anything and now she&#39;s getting dexamethasone injections into her middle ear. States she is due for one about lunch time. Pressure in both ears: patient reported has subsided, but then confirms it is a lasting effect comes and goes a little bit. Left ear is pretty much clear but right ear still has pressure and cannot hear and has not subsided. On an unknown date her equilibrium affected and stated has gotten slightly better, minuscule. Patient added she&#39;s pretty healthy and moves about, gardens takes care of business, goes to exercise class twice a week now partially participates because she gets dizzy from moving her head. Patient was treated with Valacyclovir: 1 gram tablet every 6 or 8 hours, states can&#39;t remember. Started 05MAY2021 for 7 days. Caller confirmed it did not help and she threw bottle away. Methylprednisone: 4 mg tablet by mouth started dose at every 4 or 5 hours, dose was a decreasing frequency of dose over 7 days. Confirmed she threw package away. Stated cortisone decreases irritation and inflammation. And Valacyclovir is an antiviral. Started dexamethasone injections last Thursday, 20 May 2021. Is scheduled to receive a dose today, will skip next week, and then one the following week, and then one the following week after that, states it is a series of four doses and then if that doesn&#39;t help she will have an MRI. Airborne: started taking about one week ago after first dexamethasone injection through tympanic membrane into middle ear. Relevant Tests: Hearing Test (Date: 05MAY2021)Result: pretty severe hearing loss in right ear, Test: Ear exam (Date: 03MAY2021; 05MAY2021) Result: Normal. Outcome for pain in extremity was recovered, for ear discomfort and deafness it was resolving, for hypoacusis and. equilibrium affected it was unknown.  Reporter seriousness for pressure in both ears and equilibrium affected: Medically significant, Deafness right ear: Disabling, Arm soreness: non-serious  Reporter causality: deafness in right ear: Causality: strong suspicion it&#39;s related to the vaccine, maybe not necessarily the vaccine itself, but her immune system reaction to the vaccine. Causality for pressure in both ear, arm soreness and equilibrium: related; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of  events such as deafness,balance disorder and ear discomfort cannot be totally excluded.

Every day she and I play cards, but this day she was really struggling. She couldn&#39;t figure out where any of the cards went, and was missing every play. I tool her up to lay down. At about 6pm, her eyes looked really glassy and she was unable to speak clearly. Her words were very slurred, and her sentences did not make any sense. I called 911, and they came and took her to the ER. The doctors said that she had a small stroke. She was put on a low dosage of blood pressure medicine, and was hospitalized for 6 days to monitor her. During that time many tests were run on her.  2nd Vaccine- 2-24-21 Two hours after returning from getting the second vaccine, the patient went upstairs to go to the bathroom and she passed out onto the bathroom floor. Again, when talking to her, her words were slurred. She was very weak. I called 911 again. Initially they were not going to take her, but when she went to get up she fell back down. She was too weak to walk, so they took her to the ER again. She was released to go home that evening. Sher saw her primary doctor and was referred by her oncologist to see a hematologist. She endured a three month waiting period until she could be tested for APLS. She will go this Friday to find out the reslts of that test. Additionally, she saw her vascular neurologist, Dr. He looked at her scans and said it was NOT a stroke. He said that  her body basically had a surge as a result of trying to fight off the vaccine. He said that the CAT scan that was done at the time she went to the ER the first time did NOT indicate signs of a new stroke, but that what they were seeing on the scans was from her past stroke. Dr. said that he saw no indication that she had another stroke and that her body was just reacting to the vaccine. He said that all of the symptoms that she had were all things that could happen because of the surge.

My eyebrows were down and my mouth my going to the left. I called my doctor and she suggested that we go to the ER. My son drove me there and I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s-Palsy. I had an MRI, with dye, to eliminate the thoughts of a stroke. I also had blood drawn for testing. I was given Prednisone and the generic of Valtrex. As of today, it is a little bit better, but it&#39;s still here. One of my eyebrows is still drooping, my lip is half swollen, my eye is starting to close a little on it&#39;s own. For two months after receiving the vaccine, I had to pull my eyelid down and cover it with gauze and tape it at night so it wouldn&#39;t dry out and get infected.

An 81-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) (at the age of 81 years) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. Medical history included low back pain, overactive bladder urgency, allergies: dye in CT scan, type 2 diabetes mellitus, flu, been achy, hip replaced about 2 years ago in 2019. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; atorvastatin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; glimepiride (GLIMIPRIME) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; omeprazole taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient previously took modafinil (PROVIGIL). Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 08Feb2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9264) (at the age of 81 years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, was the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that patient experienced intense pain in upper thigh, both legs, sometimes unable to walk, general muscle weakness, began 48 hrs post-2nd vaccine (also reported as occurring on 10Mar2021 22:00). Became less in 24 hrs, became intense again in another 24 hrs, and has continued ever since. Patient cannot sleep at night. Patient clarified she had it ever since 48 hours after second dose on 01Mar2021 and it&#39;s very unpleasant and does not know what to do about it and wanted to report it. These did not happen immediately and after second vaccine, patient did not have any problem till 48 hours, 10 o&#39;clock, she had it on Monday at 12:00 and at 10 o&#39;clock in the evening on Wednesday, she started to get intense pain on right side, she could barely walk and she have never had pain there before and she tried to walk and she was 81, she goes to the bathroom frequently with bladder issues and that was hard and it went on all night. In the morning, she had it not only in right leg but upper side like above the knees but in the front not in the back of the leg and then the next day, when she woke up and then, she had it in the upper side in left leg and closer to the groin and more like around and didn&#39;t know what to do and she wasn&#39;t going to go to an emergency ward as she was 81 and she doesn&#39;t go around that easily. Patient called her doctor, and patient had pain pretty much all day and he said how was it now and told him that it was slightly better. He said more than likely it will go away but he kept saying these are the kind of side effects that they were reporting though flu like achiness was nothing like what she had, she have had the flu (history) and been achy (history) but this wasn&#39;t like that. This was intense pain and it kind of changed a little bit during the day but it was still there. Her doctor said, if it doesn&#39;t go away by tomorrow morning which was Friday, then make an appointment and come in to see her, she will do blood work or whatever. So, she got an appointment for 2:30, by noon, it was just gone totally gone like if it never had been there. She cancelled the appointment then yesterday she got it back again and she could hardly walk but it wasn&#39;t as intense, it was really painful and hard for her to walk and it was around both legs and she doesn&#39;t know what to make of that, she went to rheumatologist because she thought she might be having muscle pain in arms from something else, he did some blood work (unknown results), he couldn&#39;t make anything out of it and he said he will look at the blood work and he gave her kind of a steroid cream to rub on arm (treatment) which she thought she had a problem but months ago (consumer was not sure). Now she couldn&#39;t sleep last night, it was so uncomfortable, and she had to go to the bathroom several times and again it really hurts to walk. So, that was what happened to her and she would not call that achiness of the flu at all. Regarding treatment, patient took Tylenol, do take other medications but nothing unusual and take the same that she always have and by the way the intense pain was only in one leg for twelve to twenty hours and then all of a sudden it began in the left leg as well and slightly with different pace but still on. The one in the right leg was most intense, she could barely stand. For laboratory test, the &#39;BUN&#39; test was outside of the parameters and after getting several tests he did, she wanted to see if she had some sort of rheumatoid thing and they are all in her record. This was not one of the typically adverse reactions that people reported at least according to what she read and according to aspects of it. The outcome of events pain, muscle pain in arms, and BUN abnormal was unknown while for other events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable nurse (patient). A 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EN6201; expiration date: 30Jun2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid left on 02Mar2021 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Neuropathy, Diabetes, AFib, Anemia, bleeding ulcer, Rectal bleeding, Hypertension, knee bleed, osteoarthritis in hands, Bursitis, Cataracts, arthritis in knees, Stroke, hearing impairment, Diverticulitis, Internal hemorrhoids, Bunionectomy, Fall, broke her ankle, device implant, Transfusion, retinal surgery, Cataract surgery, had a positive COVID test, Cholesterol, Weak and cracked fingernails and keep blood thin, to prevent clots. Concomitant medications included Onglyza for diabetes mellitus, Pantoprazole for ulcer. Fish oil for blood cholesterol abnormal, Atorvastatin for blood cholesterol abnormal, Zocor, Colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 3), Biotin, Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) for hypoaesthesia, ubidecarenone (COQ-10), macrogol 3350 (Miralax), acetylsalicylic acid (Baby Aspirin) for anticoagulant therapy, fexofenadine hydrochloride (Allegra). On an unspecified date, the patient experienced had sore arm and on 02Mar2021 had strong headache, stiffness/neck stiffness, chills, weakness, soreness all over the body, moderate soreness at the injection site after covid 19, joint pain, felt cold, tiny red spot at injection site about the size of a dime, back pain. The events were considered as non-serious by the reporter. Reporter stated that she was a Retired RN, and she had her first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 02Mar2021 at 11am, and she was scheduled for her second covid immunization on 23Mar2021. Caller has questions about side effects she experienced after the first dose and whether or not she should get the second immunization. Caller states she had a pretty strong reaction to the first injection. Caller states that she had the COVID disease in 22Oct2020, the caller went to the ER and had a positive COVID test because she had a fever, but she was sent home because her lungs were clear. She reported that both her son and her husband also got COVID around that time, but none of them had to be hospitalized. Stated that about an hour after her first injection, some soreness developed at the injection site. Later that afternoon she started to get a strong headache and her arm was getting sorer; in the evening, she started developing more joint pain in multiple joints, all over including, and especially, on her toes and feet; and her left arm was getting more sore, she got the chills, and she felt cold all the time, her temperature was 96.4; caller states that she also developed a tiny dime sized red spot at the injection site. Caller states that she also was thirsty, but she was a diabetic and that might have something to do with it. By the time it was time for her to go to sleep she was stiff and weak all over. She had neck stiffness, the feeling of being kind of stooped over. Caller was worried she would be unable to straighten up. The next morning, she still had weakness, stiffness and soreness, could hardly take a shower. She had to sit on side of tub and had to have her husband help her to get dressed. By about 10am the next day, everything started going away and by noon everything had pretty much cleared up completely and was gone. The pain in caller&#39;s feet and joints was gone by lunch and she did not have a fever. Caller states that at dinner that night, she was still weak though, and at the evening meal, she was so weak that she couldn&#39;t get up from the chair at the kitchen table alone. Once she was on her feet, she was okay, she could walk, but she uses a cane, especially when she was sick. About an hour or two later, she had a temperature of 99.4. But the next day, she didn&#39;t have a fever, and she could use that same chair without help. Caller states that she was fine by Friday and her blood sugar was 95, which was good. Caller states that she had a backache a few days following, but she has had backache before. Caller states that this was her history, she had the COVID, and she had a bleeding ulcer over a year ago now. Caller also saw a Cardiologist and had the watchman device implanted at the end of Sep2020, caller had this procedure to try and help get her off the Eliquis, which she had been on since having the stroke. Caller reports that she also had a Rectal bleed when she was put back on the Eliquis, and her doctors kept her on it because of the stroke. Caller states that she has silent A. Fib and that can throw little clots, so the doctors wanted her on a low dose of Eliquis but apparently that was too much for the caller too. Caller thinks the heart procedure is doing great and doing its job, but she was unable to go in for her follow up to the procedure, because she needed an esophageal echocardiogram to see if the device was sealed over by the heart muscle, and she couldn&#39;t have that until Jan2020, because she had to test negative for COVID twice. Caller states that her hemoglobin never really recovered more than 10 since her bleeding ulcer. But her hemoglobin went down to 7.4 and she was sent to the ER at the end of Jan2021, and she had two transfusions, and the next morning her hemoglobin went down to 7, the hospital staff thought that she must be bleeding. So the caller saw a GI doctor who said that the caller needed an endoscopy and colonoscopy to see where this was coming from, to make sure she was not bleeding from the ulcer. They saw the ulcer was healed but irritated, and the colonoscopy removed a couple polyps. The polyps were negative for cancer cells. After the caller had the COVID injection, she had blood in her stool. Caller went to the ER in the evening of 08Mar2021, and she stayed in the ER until the next morning. Caller states that the stool sample did show that there was some blood in her urine (captured as provided by the caller), and the ER did a CT of her abdomen, and they didn&#39;t see blood or diverticulitis. Caller does have a history of diverticulosis or internal hemorrhoids. Because things were going on last Fall, and things were rescheduled with the COVID disease, and things, the caller did not get her regular flu shot until 12Jan2021, because she needed two negative COVID tests prior to being able to get the Flu shot. She got two negative COVID tests on 24Dec2020 and 06Jan2021. Caller does not know if having had her flu shot in Jan2021, could have affected it. Caller was concerned and was wondering if she should take the second dose of the COVID vaccine or not. HCP Details: Caller hasn&#39;t spoken to her PCP since she was last in the hospital. She tried to call her HCP, but that office was getting a new computer system and they were having a high call volume for COVID stuff, so caller could not get through to them. Caller plans to email her doctor today. Everything has been overwhelming with all these things and people for doctors to juggle. Event Details: Caller reports that the soreness at her injection site, by the next morning, was up into her shoulder. Caller states that her niece, who was not a nurse, called the caller and told her to get the injection three fingers below the shoulder joint, because there were some instances of people getting injected into the shoulder joint. So, caller had soreness at the injection site, but within 24 hours, states that she was just sore all over, but it all went away by the afternoon the next day. Caller states that, she was told that she would have reactions more to the second injection than the first, so that was her concern, was she does not want to get the second injection and then it be worse than what she experienced. Caller had a lot of pain in her toes following the COVID injection, but she has diabetes that was well controlled, and she has neuropathy, and probably arthritis. But caller states that the pain in her toes was worse than normal, following receiving the COVID vaccine. Caller has had a bunionectomy, so she always has some numbness in the toe, and she fell and broke her ankle a few years later. But caller states that the very concerning thing was, following the COVID injection, the joint pain and soreness all over and weakness that she experienced. Caller had the stiffness together with some of the other things from her low hemoglobin anyway, as she has not fully recovered from the blood loss, but she was much better, and after the transfusions she had a hemoglobin of 10. And when caller went to the hospital lately, her hemoglobin was 9.4, and she was having it tested Tuesday morning again. Caller states that it was hard to say that everything she experienced was from the COVID vaccine, as she has a history of some of these things, including weakness. Caller finally got off the Eliquis when the hemoglobin went so low, she stopped the Eliquis maybe on 29Jan2021. Caller states that she was told by her Cardiologist that her symptoms at the time were from low Hemoglobin. Caller states that she was probably walking around with that low hemoglobin for a few days. Weakness: Caller states that at times she gets very fatigued, but she was not so weak right now. But caller states that weakness has been an up and down thing for her for the past few months, even before the COVID vaccine. Treatment: Caller took her normal Aspirin, but she did not take Tylenol even though she was told she could, and she did not take Allegra. She just took her normal medicines. History: When caller had her rectal bleed, she went into the ER on 08Mar2021, and she was sent home the next morning. Caller states that the ER was busy that evening and did not see the doctor until 10 or 11 that evening. But when the tests were finished up around 3am, the caller was told that she could go home or be admitted. Caller asked to go home but not until a little later in the morning, so she could call her family. Knee Bleed: Caller confirms it was aspirated and treated in the ER; she did not have to stay overnight. Caller saw orthopedic doctor a day or two later, and he did not order anything else. Caller walks with a cane now most the time because she is trying to avoid falling. Eliquis: Caller reports that the Eliquis was held for a few days after her GI bleed. She was taking 5mg twice a day from April or May2018. Caller had the GI bleed and the Eliquis was held for a few days and then she went back on it, then had rectal bleeding again. So, after that, caller&#39;s dose was reduced to 2.5mg twice day. The doctors did not want to take her off the Eliquis because of her prior stroke, so they just reduced her dose. The Eliquis had been preventing little TIAs and stuff in her hand and mouth and stuff. And that reduced dose was okay for a while. But caller states that she started getting those symptoms back, and several times a day she was getting the numbness, and she was scared she was going to have a stroke, so she said maybe because she was previously on mg twice a day, maybe she should up her dose to 7.5mg, and that worked well. So, caller took 5mg in the morning and 2.5mg in the evening. This was over a weekend, and on Monday the caller wrote her cardiologist, who said this dosing was not normally recommended, but if it was working for the caller, then that is okay. But then in July, the caller got the knee bleed. So, the doctors thought the caller&#39;s knee bleed was from the 2.5mg knee bleed but caller thinks she started to get that earlier because she had an episode that was similar before that, caller thought that episode in May or so was just arthritis. But, in Jul2020 her knee became swollen, very painful, and she could not get out of bed. Caller states that her son who was a weightlifter could not get her out of bed. She went to hospital via ambulance where her knee was aspirated. Caller reports that the Eliquis was not stopped due to the knee bleed, she was just told to go back to 2.5mg twice daily. Caller states that her heart doctor said that because she has had a stroke, she has to take the Eliquis to prevent stroke. Caller reports that she initially was not interested in the Watchman implant, but after all this, she decided to get that procedure so she could stop the Eliquis because she was a bleeder. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included colonoscopy: the ulcer was healed but irritated, endoscopy: the ulcer was healed but irritated, haemoglobin: 7.4 on Jan2021, haemoglobin: 7 on Jan2021. The outcome of sore arm and weakness was unknown, headache, stiffness/Neck stiffness, chills, soreness all over the body, moderate soreness at the injection site, Joint pain, felt cold, tiny red spot at injection site about the size of a dime were recovered on 03Mar2021 and back pain recovered on 09Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of pain in arm,toe,headache,stiffness,chills,weakness,pain,joint pain,feeling cold,vaccination site erythema,pain and pain in toe.

I would have her check her sugar and it would be fine,  but I dismissed it as a good thing that her sugar was ok.  It didn?t cross my mind until the major strokes that it could be related to the vaccine.  She had major strokes in May as a result of blood clots in heart and head.  I strongly believe that her death is related to the vaccine.  She was well,  and had her diabetes under control,  and three months after getting the vaccine,  she was dead.

It has not done anything but stayed in the muscle occasionally; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This 81-year-old female consumer (patient) reported for herself.  An 81-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0176, Expiration date: 20Aug2021), via intramuscular, administered in right arm on 15May2021 (at the age of 81-year-old) as DOSE 2, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0164, Expiration date: 20Aug2021), via intramuscular, administered in right arm on 24Apr2021 at 12:15 or 12:30 (at the age of 81-year-old) as DOSE 1, SINGLE. The patient medical history includes Pneumonia cryptococcal (Dormant Lung disease cryptococcus), Osteopenia, Pancreatic disorder, Crohn&#39;s disease and Colectomy (2002), Cancer, Diabetes mellitus and Polyp, aphasia and seizures (1996).  Dormant Lung disease cryptcoccus, this comes from pigeons, bats and birds poo flying in the air. With allergies the caller breathed it in on some far at the time in year 2000. Checked every year since year 2000.  Gastroenterologist after many undisclosed solution for drastic weight loss since year 2018, now several tests have determined the caller&#39;s pancreas and stomach are not cooperating with each other. The caller has many issues with what the Gastroenterologist are doing with the caller, she feels like a Guinea pig. Concomitant medications include PANCREATIN (CREON) for Pancreatic disorder, AMITRIPTYLINE for Cerebral disorder and CYANOCOBALAMIN (B12-VITAMIIN). The patient was taking concomitant products creon because stomach and pancreas not cooperating with each other. In relation back up to brain thing drug for that is Amitriptyline. Began taking probably 12 years ago, 10 years ago at least. B12 was taking for memory, began taking probably 4 years ago courtesy of all the testing the general physician had done. The caller states she was lacking in so much and will be on this for the rest of life. Amitriptyline was supposed to take 10mg pill twice a day but don&#39;t take twice a day. Caller is getting antsy about putting too many chemicals in the body. When the caller is crying again will take more amitriptyline. So far just upset about current Pfizer situation. Only member to have Crohn&#39;s disease and intestines removed. Gall bladder, caller has not gotten. Cancer, diabetes and polyps in family history.  On 15May2021, after the vaccination, the patient experienced bad side effects of excruciating pain 3.5 hours later and the pain was for some reason was in left arm. This arm pain lasted off and on for two days. It was extreme pain. It has not done anything but stayed in the muscle occasionally, and the shoulder joint was picking occasionally, on the left and the caller still had the clicking. The pain was a normal like grade of 2 to 3 type pain at the time of this report. Whenever the caller twinges the pain happens on its own. Patient also experienced wobbly ankles, knees and hips. The caller&#39;s walking was terrible, caller states this is just persisting but at a lower level. The caller is concerned because she is a fracture risk person because of osteopenia. Patient experienced blurry eyes and tiredness. The caller usually gets blurry eyes when the caller is not hydrated enough because of loss of weight and the ileostomy bag itself is free flowing so the caller&#39;s retention is not good to begin with. The caller clarifies the infectious disease doctor when the caller was reviewed in April, prior to receiving the Pfizer Covid Vaccines, knew the caller was under weight and severely effected because the caller wears an ileostomy bag due to Chron&#39;s disease and intestines being removed twice. The caller&#39;s absorption is not normal to begin with. When the doctor&#39;s office authorized the caller to get the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine in the first place it was within a 20 minute response time and nobody evidently checked the caller&#39;s chart prior to approving the caller to get this serious serious of Pfizer Covid Vaccines. Which is why the caller is so annoyed. The patient fell asleep on the couch with the radio on.  The caller woke up to her surprise not knowing that she had even gone to sleep for a God knows unknown period. The caller continued to listen to all her favorite shows on the Saturday night radio and it happened again, the caller doesn&#39;t know the time it was the caller fell asleep again, patient also states that she passed out or what the heck ever is going on with the caller&#39;s brain. Patient also experienced tiredness, she states she delivered the grocers and unloaded the groceries and was really wiped out.

She states God knows how many minutes later in the caller&#39;s driveway sitting at the steering wheel of the caller&#39;s car. The caller has no recollection of what transpired in the 12 miles from the brother&#39;s house to the caller&#39;s house. Patient also experienced blood clot coming from the nasal area on 15May2021. It was a tiny blood clot, not normal, red from end to end. A hair, two or three like hair from the head coming out of the left nostril when the caller blew her nose.

On 17May2021 patient called the doctor&#39;s office and listed all of her side effects and passed the message to whatever nurse on duty and the nurse consults the doctor.

An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E73246, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 14:15 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cardiac pacemaker insertion, high blood pressure for years. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS). The patient previously took flu shot (FLU VACCINE II) and never had a reaction to the flu shot, macrodantin and experienced drug hypersensitivity and hives. It was reported that about 15:15, injection site felt like it was on fire and then the whole arm felt like it was on fire. The patient got concerned. Her throat felt like it was going to close. Symptoms got less severe. She was fine yesterday and was fine that day. She called her doctor and was advised to put cold compresses on the arm and take Tylenol. She was ok. She read an article that stated if a person had a reaction to not have the second shot. She did not know if her reaction is severe. The second shot is due around 27Jan2021. She wanted to know what to do.  She felt fine on the day of report and was fine 2-3 hours after the onset of the hot and fiery feeling. It was scary and she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She also added that around 15:15, the injection arm felt like it was on fire. She felt flushed. Her throat felt like it would close up but never did. Everything resolved 2-3 hours after it started. Clinical outcome of the events was recovered on 06Jan2021.

An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on14Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis on clavicle, thorax and lumbar. The patient had concomitant medications (unspecified). The patient wanted to report the reactions occurred on 14Jan2021 for the vaccine she got; she got a headache, couple of hours later, her neck was hurting. So, she asked somebody that was with her to check and told her that it was swollen. She also had dryness, felt it on lips. The patient touched her neck and it hurts. It did hurt and it was swollen, the neck. They gave her Tylenol and Benadryl. So, it does help her sleep but the next day, she was not so much hurting. Just had headache. On 17Jan2021, when she touched the back of her ear, it was tender and very sore. It was not as bad as it was. The first day (14Jan2021), she was feeling very tender on the gland. Those were not swollen. Lymphatic glands, those were the ones that got swollen on 14Jan2021. She would like you to know the main cause, they looked and told her it is normal for the lymphatic glands to get swollen after the vaccine. So, the patient guessed that is what she got but she still had a lot of soreness in the back of her neck. Outcome of the event events headache and neck pain was not recovered while unknown for other events.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

When I woke up  around 8:30 could feel some.   During day some little ones mostly arms or hands, once in a while legs,  Monday 1/23 around 9:00 PM a hard jerk on left shoulder and at night kind of a hard one on left arm.   Seemed to have seattled down to mostly subtle ones in hands or arms on and off.  Legs feel kind of stiff or tight.    Once in awhile felt pulsating through out, but that seems to have gone away.  Mild pain feeling around shoulder blades on and mostly off.  Never had before.

Attempted to vomit but only gaged.  Friend called at 700am and I wasn&#39;t making much sense.  Later in the day I seemed alright, became cold in the evening and fever had returned.  At 4 am morning of 2/17 I woke up soaking wet.  Went back to sleep and seemed to be fine when I got up at 8am.  It is now 2 weeks since I had this shot and I have experienced no further problems.  My daughter-in-law Is a doctor and she said I should report these side effects.

                                                ache on her left arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer via a Pfizer-sponsored program. An 82-year-old female patient received their first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9262, expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included breast cancer from 01Dec2020 to an unknown date.  Concomitant medication included simvastatin and lisinopril. It was reported that she got her first dose on 23Jan2021 and she got an ache on her left arm and then she was originally scheduled for second dose on 13Feb2021, however though, she was rescheduled to have the second dose on 9Feb2021, that is 17 days earlier and she is worried about it and matter of fact is she will have an surgery of breast lumpectomy on 11Feb2021. So, her concern is if she can second dose early and or if it&#39;s okay to have the surgery prior the vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included weight: about 200 pounds (overweight) on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                Got her vaccine, came home drove herself, had no problem whatsoever, felt perfectly fine during the day.  She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

This happens every night about one hour after sleep. I have no fever.   But I feel like I am in an oven.  Subsides about one hour later but extreme tinnitus continues.  During the day I feel hot but not the same intensity of the nightly attacks. Never had this before. I had a second shot on 2/26 and on that night it was very severe.  Still suffering to this date. Primary doctor does not know what I have.  Blood work negative except for two positive Ana antibody tests.

An 82-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 82 years old. Medical history included history of a stroke from an unknown date (previous history of a stroke 19 months ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2(Lot# EW5318) on 07Feb2021, at 82 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event (no reaction). Other historical vaccine included Flu shot (influenza vaccine) on an unspecified date and experienced almost killed her. The patient reported no reaction and no problems (no pain, no nausea, no anything) from the second dose until the evening of 08Mar2021 when she was in her kitchen cooking and chopping vegetables, she felt the sudden urge to faint and then became so dizzy that she had to lie down on the couch. She had an overwhelming feeling of dizziness. A feeling like she wanted to faint, and she never faints. Her daughter got her to the sofa. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. The room spun unbelievably. Everything spun. She went to bed and when she woke up, she felt worse. She states that the dizziness was worse, she was unable to visually focus, if she closed her eyes and she opened one eye it would be blurry and the people on TV were sliding off the screen and  everything was sliding away, and she had pain behind her left eye into her head. When she tried to get up to go to the bathroom the room was spinning. It lasted through the next day (09Mar2021). When she got up, she couldn&#39;t put her two feet on the floor out of bed without leaning towards the left. She didn&#39;t fall. It was so bad she had to grab onto things to walk.  During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on Mar2021 which included blood pressure, triglyceride, fluids or liquids: tested perfect; and CAT scan, EKG had unknown results. On 11Mar2021, CT Scan: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem); MRI: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of overwhelming feeling of dizziness and unable to visually focus.

                                                COVID Vaccine  I got my #2 Pfizer last Tuesday Apr 6....no problem at all with #1.  The vaccination was in my LEFT arm, and the 1st day or so I didn&#39;t really have anything but tiredness.  But the last few days have been very painful.  I developed swelling on the RIGHT side of my face starting at the temple. That progressed down to the ear area the next few days and was quite painful.   Since Saturday  my tongue, lips, gums became swollen resulting in barely being able to swallow. Also rash developed and is getting worse.  Additionally I ache all over and feel like a very bad case of the flu.  I tried Tylenol Extra Strength in the beginning, but that seemed to only ease the pain for about an hour.  Now I&#39;m  using  Advil, which helps for several hours.  Is there anything I can do to get relief.  This is the 8th day....and it seems to be getting worse instead of better.

                                                In the middle of the night, I AWAKENED to the MOST SEVERE PAIN in my left arm. Thought perhaps a clot or a heart attack. ALTHO IVE NEVER HAD EITHER SO I DIDNT KNOW WHAT WHAT HAPPENING.  I just lay there in place. I was awake and alert so I figured neither of the above. However, when I tried to use my arm, in a number of directions,  It was extremely painful. I could not put this arm behind my back as tho to scratch my back. I am not sure if it was an attack on a MUSCLE or TENDON. I do know that in December 2019 I was given a 3-day dose of CIPRO anti-Biotics WHEN in the middle of the THIRD night I awakened with exactly the same reaction to the COvid vaccine BUT IN MY RIGHT LEG. In both instances it has taken me months to heal. I did go for therapy for my right leg event. Not for the left arm.  I can only conclude that there is a connection between the medications.

An 82-year-old male received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot/Batch number: Unknown, ExpirationDate: Unknown) on 30Mar2021 via unspecified route of administration at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 Immunization. The patients medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated the next morning she could not open her mouth, could not chew, face was hot and puffy, might have some fever also. She took a couple of Aleve, and it went away after couple of days. The patient stated she didn&#39;t know for sure if it was related to the Covid-19 vaccine or not. The day that she got the Covid-19 vaccine, later provided as 30Mar2021, she felt fine and never had a sore arm or fever. It was reported that it was almost like lockjaw, that she couldn&#39;t brush her teeth or chew. The patient reported that later in the day, the side of her face was all hot and might have been swollen and she took ibuprofen and that the inability to open her mouth went away in a couple of days. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient reported that she went to the chiropractor a couple of days later and the chiropractor said that he had heard about patients experiencing lockjaw after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and she looked on Pfizer&#39;s website and the AE she experienced was not listed as a side effect. She is just a little concerned as she is scheduled to receive her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine next week on 20Apr2021. She is afraid that the lockjaw might come back and might be worse. She is just curious if she is the only one that experienced the inability to open her mouth. The patient reported she does not know anyone that had this reaction and it is not listed as a side effect on Pfizer&#39;s website. The outcome of the event was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

She has had blood work for evaluation that is normal per her report. She is pending a follow up with her oncologist in May for breast cancer. advised that she contact her oncologist for possible PET scan and or earlier follow up. I explained this is unlikely related to vaccine given the length of time between exposure and symptoms. I explained that I will follow up with her in a week to see how things are going to be sure. She was happy with this plan.

I kind of think that I was given the whole vial of the vaccine and want to know how long will it take for it to wear off, I watched them draw up the vaccine and they gave me everything in the vial. I think I got the whole vial.

                                                Patient admitted on 5/5/21 for suspected acute ischemic CVA after presenting with altered speech for a day (last known well on 5/4/21 PM). No CT evidence of an acute intracranial process. Her pacemaker precluded MRI evaluation.  Pacer interrogated on 5/6/21 with AT/AF burden &lt;0.1%. She was seen in consultation by neurology.  Evaluation and clinical deficits were suggestive of acute ischemic CVA. Risk factors for CVA include age, HTN, Afib. Patient recently received her first COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 4/26/21. Patient?s symptoms improving with antiplatelet and statin therapies along with blood pressure management. Per Neurology consult, possible etiologies include cardioembolic versus atheroembolic versus thrombotic versus inflammatory related to recent COVID-19 vaccine. The neurologist specifically stated that ?The COVID vaccine was temporally close to this event. I have seen transient CNS inflammation from the vaccine--probability low but still possibility.?

Sometime after the afternoon of 2/7/21 and the morning of 2/8/21 she was found unconscious and unresponsive on the floor.  As her dinner from the evening of 2/7/21 was still on the table unfinished and she was fully dressed we assume that whatever caused her to end up on the floor unconscious happened on 2/7/21  She was taken to the emergency room and it was determined that she was not going to survive.  She never regained consciousness and was having seizures all the way to the hospital in the back of the ambulance.  She was made comfortable and passed on 2/11/21.

It is swollen and hurts to walk on.; my right foot started to bother me on the ball of my foot. It is swollen and hurts to walk on.; pain down the left side then nothing else but a little in the arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical information team. A 82-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9262; Expiration Date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in top of left arm on 26Jan2021 (at the age of 82-years) as 0.3 mL, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included: sinus disorder, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, cholesterol. She has had cholesterol for years. She has sinus problems on and off. She suffers from GERD. She was on a pill to help with the stomach prior, but not on it now. She took the last one on 30Jan2021. She had been on it for two months. She doesn&#39;t remember the name of the medication. It was a time released capsule. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included: ongoing simvastatin (20 mg at night) taken for blood cholesterol and unspecified vitamins. She has been on simvastatin (generic for Zocor) for about eight years. She was on Lipitor (strength: unknown) for years and changed to Simvastatin. She got off Lipitor because she felt like it wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to do. Caller doesn&#39;t have product to provide lot number. She hasn&#39;t been on it for 10 to 12 years. No vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient had pain down the left side then nothing else but a little in the arm. On 30Jan2021, the patient&#39;s right foot started to bother on the ball of her foot. It was swollen and hurts to walk on. The clinical course included: the patient got her COVID shot on Tuesday (26Jan2021). She did in the middle of the night have pain down the left side then nothing else but a little in the arm. Then on Saturday (30Jan2021), her right foot started bothering her on the ball of her foot. It was a burning sensation. Yesterday was very bad and she could hardly walk. It is swollen on the bottom of the ball of her foot and across the top where her toes are. Her son just kept calling and telling her to check her temperature and pulse rate. She took Tylenol (strength: 500mg, Lot number: HDAO52; she had only taken two of them and it expired on Feb2019. She took one yesterday afternoon and one last night when she went to bed), applied ice (off and on), and elevated it and the swelling didn&#39;t go down. She did elevate it above her heart. Again, this morning she has the same thing. She was having a heck of a time walking. It was very painful. She was hoping she can walk normal again. It was still painful today. If she accidentally bumps it, it hurts. It was swollen. It started 4 days after receiving the vaccine. Caller stated she no longer had the problem with her arm. She has recovered completely. It was only bothering her a little bit on the twenty seventh (27Jan2021), but nothing to be concerned about. Investigations included: She hasn&#39;t been able to taste for some time and had a COVID test in December and she was negative. She was still having trouble tasting and had a CT scan of her sinuses last week (results not reported). She will follow up with her doctor about that. The outcome of event pain down the left side then nothing else but a little in the arm was resolved on an unspecified date in 2021 and for other events it was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

An 82-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261; Expiration Date: 31May202, NDC: 59267-1000-2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 06Feb2021 at 12:00 as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing emphysema, ongoing breast cancer from 2007 (she did not take chemo, just radiation) and ongoing follicular lymphoma from 2014 (did not take chemo, just radiation. Cancer was in the bone marrow, said she didn&#39;t think that has anything to do with it, has had two operations) and bone marrow cancer. The patient previously took budesonide/ formoterol fumarate (SYMBICORT) she was using SYMBICORT, but her doctor switched it a few months ago, back to ANORO), prochlorperazine maleate (COMPAZINE) she takes a couple of times per month, takes 10mg when she feels nauseated and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) she takes when she needs it. Concomitant medications included furosemide (LASIX) at 40 mg, twice a day (one 40mg pill in the morning and one 40mg pill at night) from 1985 to an unspecified date and then increased to 80 mg, twice a day (two pills (80mg total) in the morning and two (80 mg total) at night) from on an unspecified date and ongoing for blood pressure; ongoing simvastatin (ZOCOR) taken for high triglycerides; umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol trifenatate (ANORO). Patient thought she has been on Lasix since 1985 but can&#39;t remember back that far. She was taking Zocor for a long time and stated Anoro Inhaler was a fairly new medication. For Anoro inhaler, patient stated she pulls back the thing and didn&#39;t know, maybe it pinches a pill and inhales the white powder. Relevant family medical history included none and both parents were deceased. Patient stated that her oncologist does blood tests once every four months, a test for markers and stuff like that, CBC, metabolic panel and bloodwork every 4 months. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL3246, Expiration date: 30Apr2021, NDC: 59267-1000-2) via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 pm for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that, the patient has very sexy legs, but she doesn&#39;t anymore, says she got lymphedema about 5-6 days after the second Pfizer vaccine in Feb2021. She was now going to physical therapy, to bear her out and try to understand what she&#39;s saying. Caller states 30% of the people there that have had cancer and had radiation, get the same side effect she has had, some people have it in the arms, she got hers in her leg, says she has intense swelling, called lymphedema, says her legs look like they belong on an elephant. Caller said at the physical therapy place, 30% of people who have come in for help had radiation treatment for some kind of cancer, all have different kinds of cancer, but the swelling, the lymphedema, was the side effect they&#39;ve all experienced. Caller states that no one has called Pfizer and let Pfizer know, states she won&#39;t take the booster, won&#39;t have anything to do with this, says it&#39;s too scary. Caller states she was an active person, never had a problem with legs swelling or anything like that and now, her look like legs that belong on an elephant. Caller states the correlation seems to be with radiation treatment, because she has bone marrow cancer, and other ladies have breast cancer, states the only thing we all have in common was different treatments but in her own case she had no chemo, but she did have radiation. It seems like with radiation this swelling was an after effect. Caller says it&#39;s 2 or 3 things, not just that they had cancer or radiation treatment, says those of us who had radiation also got this swelling. Caller states she never had any trouble with legs or anything, says she was an active person. States some people experienced this four days after the vaccine, says hers started six days after the vaccine, says she woke up one morning, and her legs were huge. States usually legs were smaller in the morning. Caller wonders what were the ingredients that causes swelling. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it, says like overnight turned a switch on and now her legs were going to be big and fat and ugly. Caller states the reason she&#39;s calling was because at physical therapy last Thursday, other people who had the shot had the same side effect, says the only thing the lady said, she wasn&#39;t sure if she was a nurse or not, was the relationship was not with the kind of cancer, but the radiation treatment and the shot has been causing this and wasn&#39;t surprised. Caller says she was told that about 30% that they&#39;re handling now had the Pfizer vaccine. Caller thinks that&#39;s all they gave in the state NC, no other vaccine here, says it just seems to be with this. Caller states the lymphedema, hers was in her legs, others have it in their arms, she doesn&#39;t know why it&#39;s happening. Caller states about six days after the second shot, she can&#39;t remember exactly what day, about six to seven days, she woke up one morning, and her legs were hurting like the devil in Feb2021, stated her legs were about six times the size they should be in Feb2021. Caller states usually in the morning, the swelling goes down, but this woke her up out of the blue like zap, says no warning, no nothing, just one day she woke up and that where it was. Caller states her doctor increased Lasix, she used to take one 40mg pill in the morning and one 40mg pill at night, increased it to two pills (80mg total) in the morning and two (80 mg total) at night. Caller states she is now only taking one-and-a-half-pills this morning, because she doesn&#39;t feel right and she was peeing too much in Feb2021 and was not feeling right. She doesn&#39;t want to get dehydrated. Caller states she has a doctor appointment 10Jun2021 and was going to tell him she was taking less because she was just so weak in Feb2021. Says she was weak because she&#39;s taking too much Lasix, states she was taking two 40mg morning and night. Caller states she was just concerned, she has big legs, fat legs, she calls them fat. The patient not visited emergency room. The events result in the patient visited physician office. Patient reported that she has had no shots for four months however she was going to get the high dose flu shot on 01Oct2021. No relevant tests were performed at the time of this report. The outcome of the events lymphedema and Legs were about six times the size they should be was not recovered and outcome for the other events was unknown.  No further details provided. Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information requested.

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine, I started feeling tired and my arm was quite sore. The following day, I had a fever of probably 100. I had chills and my heart rate and blood pressure went up. Since I have A-Fib, it was irregular. After several hours, my HR went back to normal and that is when I called my Cardiologist NP. She said that she thinks it&#39;s related to the fever I had. The next day, I felt a tad better, but fatigue and generally not feeling well lasted a few days. I feel that it took about a week before I felt normal again. About two months later, I was making plans to go out of town and I became very ill. I started having chills, fever, nausea and extreme fatigue. I may have taken some Tylenol. I was drinking a lot of water because I did not have an appetite. A couple days later I felt a little better so I did not contact my doctor, but I did go to an urgent care (05/22/2021) and had a COVID test. The test came back negative and I felt better two days later. On Monday, I started feeling bad again and I contacted my PCP, and I went to see him on Tuesday. He ran some blood tests and another COVID test, which came back negative. The fatigue just stayed around for quite some time. He monitored my sodium and chloride and they were both low so the doctor wanted them monitored. I was admitted into the hospital for two days. I was on liquid restriction. I had a bunch of tests ran that came back negative. I did have an AMA test which did come back positive. I am still on water restriction, but I am feeling much better. I&#39;m a bit leery about receiving a booster shot.

An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 29May2021 11:45 (at the age of 82-years-old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included sensitive skin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.

She should have gone to the emergency room, but she was afraid they would admit her. She had read this paper on what she should, and she had almost every time. She went to her physician on 25May2021, and that they were giving the vaccine at his office and that it would be on the Friday (28May2021). Her physician had said that she needed to take the virus shot, but Friday (28May2021), it would be like to 12 o&#39;clock and she had been there on Tuesday for a physical. She said that they wanted her to make sure if she wasn&#39;t coming and reschedule. She said that she went to store on the following Saturday on 29May2021. After she got the shot, she sat there for 15 minutes and read a brochure and then stated that she had been there for 30 minutes. She was very warm that day and she went and did her little shopping and it was very hot.

She got home about 17:30. She got to feeling heat so bad and she sat on her porch which she always did before she goes in the house. She said later that day (29May2021), she started burning on left side of her head. Started burning like her head was on fire on left side of her forehead and it kept on.

She then stated that it was burning so bad she went to mirror to see what it was doing and added that the side of her forehead was red, like fire red, but it was &#34;kicking&#34;. Her son told her to put some cold compresses on it. She stated that she had been putting warm and that it had helped.

She said she thought she must be having reaction to this shot. The patient stated that she loved coffee but hadn&#39;t even drank her coffee because she doesn&#39;t have any taste on 29May2021. She then looked at the information that was provided and the next day (on 30May2021), there was a big old sore like staph like someone had poured acid on her and for 2 days, she didn&#39;t put anything on her head to touch it. The patient considered the events feeling hot as serious and persisting, rash on nose as serious, rash all over the place as disabling, but then commented it was medically significant, nausea and vomiting had improved but was serious, eyes and face swollen up and pain on top of the forehead as very serious (even with her sitting, she could feel the pain arising on the left side), and sores on scalp and head as serious as serious.

She further stated that &#34;you could to the emergency room with a thumbtack and be put on Intensive Care Unit&#34; and reiterated that she wasn&#39;t going. The patient had rash in her hair and didn&#39;t want anything touching it as it was just painful and felt like a big old sore, like a scab.

                                                Tingling lips; nose and cheeks tingling; Chest tightness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH mRNA COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6206), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 28Feb2021 (at the age of 82-year-old) administered at approximately 13:30-13:45 (at the age of 82-year-old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunisation. She did not have prior vaccinations in 4 weeks. Medical history included multiple allergies. she had allergies to Penicillin and Sulfa, since in her 40s. Concomitant medications included (procaine hydrochloride) NOVOCAIN taken for an unspecified indication from 24Feb2021 to an unspecified stop date. She had dental work on Wednesday, 24Feb2021, that included a shot of Novocain. She said she wondered if the Novocain shot had anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine causing the tingling in her lips, nose and cheeks, since everything she experienced on 28Feb2021 happened in her face area. She did not have the Novocain dose, NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. The patient previously took codeine experienced drug allergies. She said her second COVID-19 Vaccine was a couple days before the recommended 21 days between COVID-19 Vaccine doses. The patient experienced tingling lips, nose and cheeks tingling, chest tightness on 28Feb2021 at 22:00. She clarified the tingling in her cheeks was higher up around her cheek bones. She said her cheek tingling was not as strong as the tingling in her lips and nose. She had allergies, and was scared, so she went to the emergency room. She clarified her lips, nose, and cheeks tingling started approximately 5 hours after she received her first COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she went to the emergency room about 5 hours after the tingling started, at 22:00 (28Feb2021). Treatment was reported as she was given 1 intramuscular shot of Benadryl while she was in the emergency room. She said she did not know the Benadryl dose or the Benadryl NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. She clarified the intramuscular Benadryl shot did not effect her lip, nose and cheek tingling at all. She said she was wondering if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She was discharged home from the emergency room after about 2 hours. She said she was given a prescription for oral Benadryl 25mg by mouth, four times a day, as needed, for itching and allergies (30 tablets). She said she did not fill the Benadryl 25mg tablet prescription because she did not think the Benadryl prescription was necessary. she also had felt a little tightening in the center of her upper chest area, towards her throat. She said the chest tightening was very slight, so much so, that she thought the chest tightening maybe her imagination. She said the slight chest tightening went away sooner than her lip, nose, and cheek tingling. The tingling in her lips, nose, and cheeks was much less by the next morning (01Mar2021) and was completely gone by noon (01Mar2021). She said she called her dentist on 01Mar2021 to ask if he thought the Novocain could have contributed to her lips, nose, and cheeks tingling. She said her dentist told her he didn&#39;t think the Novocain had anything to do with the tingling she experienced after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she had Novocain in the past, and Novocain had never caused her to have a reaction. The second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was scheduled for 19Mar2021. The outcome of the event was recovered on 01Mar2021   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 82-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: Feb2022) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Right on 05Mar2021 13:20 (age at vaccination 82years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure measurement. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced running from nose, coughing, her eyes were so foggy, urinating cloudy and with a chemical smell on 05Mar2021, blood pressure and heart rate off the wall, swelling of the face, mouth was swollen, just her face and her lips were real swollen, weak, tiredness, had a bowel movement, it was white-looking and smelled like a chemical on 06Mar2021, having trouble thinking on Mar2021, blurred eyes on an unspecified date. She has never reported the side effects that she had, and her daughter told her should have done that. She found her papers and now she is 82 and she got her first shot on 05Mar2021. Patient reported as she felt fine then she got up to leave and her nose started running and it was just like water was pouring out and she made it up to the front and had Kleenexes in her pocket, then started coughing violently, her nose was running violently and trying to come out of her mouth, and she sat down on the chair there and she thought it will pass. she walked out to look for the person that took her out there and she saw exactly where they parked, and her eyes were so foggy she could hardly even see the car. She felt okay then the next day, she got up and her mouth was swollen, just her face and her lips were real swollen. However, her whole face was swollen. she didn&#39;t read the side effects to it and thought oh well, it&#39;s just some-thing. The next day her blood pressure was going off the wall, her heart rate was horrible, she called the doctor, they wanted her to go to the hospital. The doctor told her to take Benadryl, and Benadryl bothers her, and she said that made her worse. It made her worse. She further clarified made her worse as, it made her heart worse, dizzy and lethargic and she was already tired anyway. she would have been better off not taking it. Her heart rate, which is always normal or very good, and it was like it was going ninety miles an hour. she would get it to slow down then it would feel like it was going 90 miles an hour for a few days then she was really weak and her mind, which at her age she has a very good mind, they tested that, she was having trouble thinking. she guesses she would call it foggy. she wanted to sit down and pay bills, but she couldn&#39;t even concentrate. Her question is she had the first shot but now she&#39;s afraid to get the second shot because of what it did the first time around. she&#39;s afraid it will do double; they say it&#39;s a worse reaction. The card that she had, she said that her nose was running so bad, she shoved the card in her purse and looked in her purse later and she can&#39;t even find that card. She will say she can&#39;t get the flu shot because in the past, she had a very bad reaction from the flu shot, she was questioning whether to get this vaccine or not. It wasn&#39;t a live vaccine. she is scared to death of the virus and her kids wanted her to get it now, hurry, hurry, and she thought she would try it. Since she has reactions to suspect product, she&#39;s concerned about getting the second one. That was 10 years or more that she had the bad reaction. She is a person that her body is very sensitive. Her doctor has trouble getting medicines she can take. She has a bad back, she has tired every painkiller there is and she can&#39;t take any of them, they are worse than the pain. She has trouble seeing too. She keeps every-thing up, they don&#39;t give as many papers and it changes every week. She doesn&#39;t know how the people in the medical profession can take it, she imagines they change things on them overnight. She has macular. She couldn&#39;t understand with that shot why she could see whenever she went in and after she got the shot then everything was fogged when she came outside, but she knows it still wasn&#39;t as bad as getting the virus. She&#39;s still weak, but she&#39;s gotten better. They said she could leave, her nose started running and she started coughing. The girl said is she okay and thought she was, and she made it out then started coughing violently and that water was almost drowning her. She sat down in the chair, and it finally calmed down and got in the car, kept wiping that water with paper towels in her car and coughing and by the time she got home it was slowed down. She is more tired than usual, and her eyes haven&#39;t cleared up as good as they should. She doesn&#39;t know what that happened, it just came out of there and thought well god what has happened to her eyes. She has an appointment with the Optometrist at the end of April. Another thing she forgot, they are going to think she&#39;s looney, she started urinating that evening and she thought, this is not good, something was going on with her kidneys, because it was cloudy-like and had a chemical smell and then the next morning, she still smelled the same thing and her bowels were the same way, just smelled this chemical. That evening her urine was like that and the next morning she noticed it was like that into the next day, whatever was in there had to come out and then her urine and things cleared up. Started on 05Mar2021, that evening, when she urinated before she went to bed it was cloudy and had this chemical smell, maybe it was something she ate or something. The next morning, she urinated a lot and it was cloudy and the bowel movement, it was white-looking and smelled like the chemical and cleared up. She has recovered completely after whatever was in there got out the next day. She states she was okay after she did all that, she cleared up. The clinical outcome of the event blurred eyes was unknown, another events week, her eyes were so foggy, having trouble thinking, tiredness was recovering, and event running from nose, coughing recovered on 05Mar2021, blood pressure and heart rate off the wall was recovered on 09Mar2021, swelling of the face, mouth was swollen, just her face and her lips were real swollen was recovered on an unspecified date Mar2021, urinating cloudy and with a chemical smell and had a bowel movement, it was white-looking and smelled like a chemical was recovered on 06Mar2021.

Medical history included arthritis and lost a couple of inches from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the Covid-19 shot on 06Jan2021 and had reaction on both legs. They were covered in red spots and at knees it was especially bad, it wasn&#39;t like bumps, it wasn&#39;t like rash it&#39;s more like a color and skin it felt very warm and legs from the knees down especially kept patient awake at night from itching and the itching started on 07Jan2021 night into 08Jan2021 and it woke patient up and patient was just calling at knees. So patient got up and went into bathroom and patient put some anti-itch that&#39;s what patient husband had for his allergies. Patient said the spots on knees, the red spots are basically gone but they were still there and the left knees was specially bad and you can feel through pants even that it&#39;s warm on these places but when rubbing hands on it you can&#39;t feel rash or anything, it was more like a discoloration in skin, there was also a red spot over the injection site, patient would say about the size of a tennis ball and also there was a swelling just that gone bad but and it was okay really but it was there, patient had at a place on belly and it was gone, so let do something else but the discoloration on leg the splotches, patient guess they called splotches not a rash like a pimply rash but just there and they itch something there but it was getting better now. Patient was about 5&#39;4&#39; or maybe 5&#39;4.5&#39;, and patient weighed a 141. Patient had 2 Covid test that were negative. Patient got the vaccine at the College. Patient got it in the upper left arm in the muscle it was not hurt when it went in but it was kind of hurting now, but it was okay. Patient put some kind of cream as treatment. The adverse events resulted in neither doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, nor emergency room/department or urgent care. Patient was going to because it was hurting so bad like a waxing kind of stinging and burning but then patient just put more cream on it and it would stop, it was going to the doctor on 09Jan2021 morning but it was so much less and now patient didn&#39;t think she feel any ill effects. Outcome of all events was recovering.

                                                My mom received the Covid 19 vaccine on Jan 5, 2021 and became very about a week later. I was informed that she tested positive for Covid 19 on January 14th. One January 17th she became very tired and weak and would not eat. Hospice called me and told me that she was in a decline state. I saw her on January 25 and 26 and she was just sleeping and could not open her eyes. Her vitals were good and she seemed to understand when I talked to her - she would squeeze my hand and moan but she could not talk or open her eyes. My mom passed away on January 27, 2021 just 22 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She was very think to begin with and being to weak and tired  to eat resulted in her losing even more weight. Some of the other residents were given fluids to help and they recovered. My mom was not given fluids. I believe there were 20 deaths in her care home for the month of January when they vaccinated. This was an alarming number of deaths for the home. The facility had very few Covid deaths in 2019 and 2020. I asked every week if they had any Covid and or Covid deaths and this amount was shocking to me and the workers there.

An 83-year-old female consumer received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 13Jan2021 at 12:30-13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (over the age, senior citizen). Lot number was EL8982. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, Compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity), high blood pressure, cholesterol. Concomitant medications included medicines for high blood pressure and cholesterol. Patient reported that she took suspect vaccine and for 4 days she felt fine but then in Jan2021 she developed a backache (just below the shoulder; it was really bad and very uncomfortable, on 17Jan or 18Jan, as reported), pain under arm, ache under arm pit (reportedly as worsening) and a rash from her elbow up. Patient thought after a couple days pain would be gone; it was just as bad as when it started. The patient received TYLENOL in Jan2021 and ongoing for pain, but it did not work. The patient did not visit emergency room or physician due to the events. The outcome of rash was unknown, the patient did not recover from other events.

                                                I developed a very sore arm.  It swelled around the injection site, turned red, formed a hard lump and was hot to the touch..  This has lasted all week but it has become progressively less.  I am very active (for my age).  I swim 1/2 mile laps twice a week; do regular exercises for balance and to relieve back pain and regularly do tai chi.   I think this exercise, especially with my arms has helped reduce the symptoms.  The symptom wasn&#39;t serious and did not impede my activities.  I am sending this because I thought it might be helpful.

She does have rosacea but this was worse.  After she got home she began to feel her heart beating rapidly.  She had taken her medications, but about 6:00 PM she took an extra dose of Metoprolol and waited until about 8:00 PM and the rapid heart beat was still there.  Her son took her BP and it was extremely high and it was 119/68, pulse 112.   At 11:00 her BP was 108/59 with a pulse of 78.   She was able to sleep but did feel heaviness the day later and rapid beating had subsided.   She is still having the rosacea, tingling, stinging of her face.  Her vaccine site was not even sore and he no problems with that.  She called her doctor and the nurse called her back, and she has been trying to call the place where she got the vaccine.  She was told to make sure what to do before she gets the 2nd shot.   She has recovered from the rapid heart beat episode, but the skin stinging of her face is still ongoing.

Brought to ER The Four Paramedics that came to take her to the ER stated they were overwhelmed with calls for post covid vaccine problems and that ALL of their vehicles were out on calls many due to this.  Agressive workup including CT, EKG, Cardiac monitoring, CTA neck and Brain, Carotid and peripheral dopplers and vascualar surgeon consultation revealed nothing. Told it temporally had to be assoc with the vaccine??  I am reporting so that this can be evaluated for confirmation.

She had felt well and had been in her usual state of health, and was able to cook and enjoy a turkey dinner with 5 individuals on 03/07/21, but on 03/08/21 she began to develop progressive generalized weakness up to the point where she remained in bed for several days.  She could not support herself when attempting to rise from bed.  She noted poor PO intake with nausea, no vomiting.  Loose stools for several days, no noted stool blood.  Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.  She was unable to elaborate regarding the falls but admitted to hitting her head at least once, unable to say if she lost consciousness or if she felt presyncopal symptoms before falling.  She had initially presented on 03/12/21 to ED for evaluation, workup negative, labs and imaging normal.  CT brain found no acute process.  She was sent home with arrangements for home PT.  She returned to ED 03/15/21 when symptoms had not improved.  In the ED she was found to be afebrile, significantly hypertensive, mildly tachycardic, &#43; orthostatic vital signs.  Labs significant for heme occult positive stool, proBNP 397, WBC 10.1, H/H 13.4/39.9, PLT 493, UA neg for infection.  COVID neg.  CXR found slightly increased interstitial markings.  MRI brain found no acute intracranial abnormality.  She was evaluated by PT and found to be unsafe to DC home as she could not ambulate without leaning backward and to the right and needed 1-2 assist.  She was admitted to HM service for further management.  She has remained consistently afebrile.  She continues to experience significant gait instability, cognitive slowing, and difficulty with finger-to-nose testing with noted dysmetria, no focal weakness.

                                                progressive shortness of breath; hypoventilation; dysphagia; severe asthenia; mild upper abdominal pain; inability to eat; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. An 83-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Feb2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included right partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the remote past, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, morbid obesity, motion sickness, unspecified allergy as the patient cannot tolerate anything but paracetamol (TYLENOL), acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL) tablet, meclizine hcl tablet for motion relief and hydrochlorothiazide/ triamterene (DYAZIDE) capsule. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247) on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) in the left arm and experienced difficulty breathing, ground glass opaque lung problem, weak, nausea, &#34;pain on rt.side waist around to back, down to lower belly&#34;, slight temp almost 100. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath and inability to eat for two days. The patient reportedly received the second dose of BNT162B2 four days prior to coming to the emergency room (ER). In the ER, the patient reported severe asthenia, mild upper abdominal pain and dysphagia, all as of an unspecified date. The patient underwent a CTA in the ER, on Feb2021, which showed no acute pulmonary embolism, or no ground glass infiltrates. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 21Feb2021 at 17:51 for management of worsening shortness of breath. Due to the patient&#39;s acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema and obesity, hypoventilation (as of an unspecified date in Feb2021) was further complicated by obstructive sleep apnea, thus, the patient was admitted to &#34;MedSurg&#34;. The patient did not present with COVID-19 or COPD. The BMP was 226 at the time of admission. The patient was started on supplemental oxygen and additionally started on CPAP at night. She was seen by a pulmonologist who recommended Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR). Pulmonology also recommended to work-up any underlying unaddressed coronary artery disease contributing to the patient&#39;s shortness of breath. The patient underwent an echocardiogram on Feb2021 with regadenoson (LEXISCAN) for her shortness of breath which was within normal limits. As the patient additionally reported dysphagia at the time of admission, she was evaluated by a speech and swallow evaluation specialist as well as a gastroenterologist. A GI swallow series was recommended which the patient underwent on Feb2021 and was found to have no active signs of oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. The patient additionally underwent a physical exam on 24Feb2021 at 08:00 with the following results. Vital signs: Temp: 98.2, Pulse: 69, Resp: 17, B/P (MAP): 98/62 (74), Pulse Ox: 96, O2 Delivery: Nasal cannula, O2 flow rate:2.00. HEENT: Pupils equal round reactive light accommodation, no lymphadenopathy noted, neck vens were apple. CVS: S1-S2 normal, no appreciable murmur rub or gallop noted. Respiratory: Good Inspiratory effort, good air entry bilaterally, no rhonchi, Rales or wheezes heard. Gl: Abdomen soft, nontender nondistended, bowel sounds heard, no organomegaly detected. Extremities: Bilateral lower extremities Shaw no edema, bilateral dorsalis pedis 2&#43;, skin appeared intact. Neurological: Patient alert and oriented x3, strength 5x5 in all 4 extremities, no signs of focal neurological deficits. Skin: No clear breakdown or rashes noted. The patient was being discharged home on 24Feb2021 at 08:04 with a CPAP machine. The patient was prescribed Cefuroxime axetil (CEFTIN) 250mg Tablet orally twice a day; Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR) 250-50 diskus 1 puff twice a day for progressive shortness of breath and hypoventilation. The patient had been advised to follow-up with a pulmonologist for an outpatient pulmonary function test. The clinical outcome of progressive shortness of breath, hypoventilation, inability to eat, dysphagia, severe asthenia and mild upper abdominal pain was unknown. The reporting physician considered that BNT162B2 had no causal effect on the events reported.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: In agreement with the HCP reporter, the reported events  do not appear to be related to the subject vaccine. The events likely represent intercurrent medical conditions, possibly associated with the patient&#39;s history of  emphysema. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Timing of these episodes are random, but seem to occur when she first gets up in the morning or after she takes a shower or has been active.  They lasts between 3 and 7 minutes and then completely resolve.  She has never had any similar symptoms.  She reports that these episodes occur between 4-6 times during the course of 24 hours.

An 83 years old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at age of 83 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hip surgery a few months ago and she was still kind of stiff and sore. Concomitant medications included lisinopril at low dose 10 mg once daily taken for blood pressure abnormal about 10 years ago; clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for transient ischaemic attack from 2012 (she believed it was a around that time); acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN LOW) at low dose (she began taking this before the Lisinopril so it has been several years).The patient mentioned that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and everything was fine that day and the day after. At late in the day on 04Mar2021, she experienced a lot of problems which she mentioned was the worst experience in her life. She was 99% sure it was from the vaccine because she didn&#39;t experience anything like that before getting the vaccine. She mentioned that she experienced side effects all night like her heart beating really fast, a headache, a stiff neck, her nerves pounding all throughout her body, and a blood pressure of 174/78. She mentioned that it was the worst she&#39;s felt so far as compared to going to the ER, as she&#39;s experienced before. She did not go to the ER as she could not drive herself and she was living alone. She mentioned that she better the next day although it was not totally gone, she was a little shake and kind of weak. As of calling, she said that she was feeling okay and better than yesterday (07Mar2021) in which the effects were still present. She mentioned that it was horrible, very scary, she was very ill, very uncomfortable, really bad, and didn&#39;t want to go through that again. She didn&#39;t know if she would make it through the night. She was asking for what to do and asking if there needed to be an adjustment for her dose because she was a very small person. She didn&#39;t want to have the 2nd shot if she went through that again. It was the worst experience of her life. She was not sure what to do now about her second shot. She had the first shot 02Mar2021 and everything was fine, 03Mar2021 she was okay but on 04Mar2021 she had, by night time, she had a lot of scary things that had never happened to her before. Her heart was pounding she could hear it in her ears. Her head, her neck felt stiff and her head felt heavy, her whole body felt heavy and like the nerves in her whole body were just aggravated, it was hard to explain. She had ringing in her ears. Her blood pressure was 174/78 and she was just afraid to have the second shot, it was scary, it was really bad. She was wondering if the amount of the vaccine was too much for her.  She confirmed it was the evening 04Mar2021 when all this began. She said all of this was pretty well recovered at this point. She said the day after that happened, she was shaky but today (08Mar2021) she was fine. She did not know what it would be medications they are looking for but she was on normal medicine for old people she guesses. This was so bad that she really was not going to take the second dose unless they can tell her if she should or that they should give her less or something like that. The outcome of events was recovered in Mar2021.

A few days prior to second shot i developed irritation on 2 days of left foot.  Following second shot, I had sore arm for a day and a half, joint pain at left hip that extended all the way down my leg which caused difficulty walking.  That pain lasted for 2 full days.  The toe irritation developed into painful blisters and extended to 3 toes on my left foot.  I am currently using Hydro cortisone cream on them.

An 83-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 28Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported: did not get a card that lists NDC, Lot, Expiration) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. It was also reported that no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient did not require visit to Emergency Room and stated that she was desperate and would&#39;ve gone but she didn&#39;t have a ride and added she is worried about the second. Also, the patient did not required visit to the physician&#39;s office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine and 5 days later she got a terrible reaction. She did not expect it. She had a terrible reaction and thought she was going to die. She stated she wanted to report this because the TV says you should expect some kind of reaction after the second dose but does not say after the first and she said that Pfizer needs to know about this reaction. She stated she heard the second dose is worse. The patient asked if she has to get her second dose and if she needs to report this anywhere else? The patient added &#34;what should I do about side effects?&#34; It was reported that the patient (reported as is almost 84) had the first shot on Sunday 28MAR2021 and everything was fine by Friday she was in terrible trouble really really bad. States she has never heard of this, they say the first is easy and everything was terrible. States every bone and every part of her body hurt on 02Apr2021. She states after 24 hours (03Apr2021) it did go away. The patient asks does this happen to other people? It was stated that her symptoms came on suddenly and she had a severe sore throat, stiff neck, back ache, pain under her ribs, very very weak and shaky, shortness of breath, biceps ached, fatigue, and a tremendous headache. It was stated that started on Friday 02Apr2021 12:00 like a hurricane and after 24 hours they subsided on Saturday 03Apr2021. The patient added that she doesn&#39;t remember getting a card and didn&#39;t know that she should have a card until she saw something about it on TV, and thought well she didn&#39;t get a card. The patient also asked what does she do about that?  The patient states she takes medication but not that affects this. The outcome of the events recovered on 03Apr2021.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a Contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was none medical history. Concomitant medication included atenolol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Her leg was swollen and there was edema and there was a lump on the side and it was pink or getting red and she was on medicine (Clarification Unknown) for 7 days, twice a day and the leg is still (incomplete sentence), the edema has gone down some. The leg was still pink and it is tender to touch and if she stand on her leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts. She got pain. She was also sleeping whereby she was watching television and all of sudden she was sound sleep and she wake up over an hour or two after that and then she awake for a while but she have no trouble sleeping at night again. She had chest pain and it&#39;s not angina because that she did have (Further clarification was unknown if consumer had angina in past hence not captured on tab) but it&#39;s a sharp pain and it does not want her taking Nitroglycerin because it went away and it last for maybe (incomplete sentence) it just like a stabbed wound. She was dizzy. That&#39;s still, it&#39;s not like what it was but it is getting less but she was still dizzy. She cannot walk a straight line. She lived in an apartment house and she had to walk down the hall to go down the stair but she sometime had to stop because she was dizzy. she kind of lean against the wall for few seconds and then she continued on. Concern was not the word for it. It made her very nervous and the circulation was very poor in both feet now and one leg, the right leg that has the pink and still the tenderness in that leg. The foot turns very dark pink and the big toe that she had turned dark purple. She wrote everything down and she will say this at the time after the injection she did not have any problem until about four days later but she did have problem with doing my cross- word puzzles and doing her puzzles. She could not do any of her puzzles, nothing was computing in her brain (Clarification unknown) but that&#39;s coming back slowly, so is that to be expected. Start date of event: Consumer stated &#34;It was 4 days after the 5th, about 09Feb2021. She went there and saw a doctor an MD of course and she went there on 12th so it was a week later. She went because the pain was terrible.

                                                She received her second COVID shot at the end of March first week of April. My mother had a stroke, several seizure and her lungs were filled with blood clots. She had to have a procedure to remove the largest one next to her heart. My mother has always been healthy and has never had any of the following issues in her life. She gets regular checkup and I spoke with her on April 19, 2021 at 12:00pm Central time and she was fine but at 1:20pm my brother who is staying at her house said she was having a seizure. I talk to my mother at least four times a day and she has never in 83yrs experienced anything like this. She doesn?t remember right now where her shot was administered but my brother took her but he is mad at me because I have full power of attorney and he is not happy. Therefore, he will not give me the information that is needEd to give to your office. My mother was admitted to the ICU. She is now at their rehab center in a hospital.  Once my mother is released from the hospital she is moving with me out of state. This is and unexpected expense that I will need assistance with but I don?t mind because it is my mother and now someone has to be with her 24/7.

                                                STROKE; Facial droop; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.  An 83-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular on 02Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9809) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation; and carbidopa, levodopa (DUOPA), via percutaneous j-tube from 2018 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) and ongoing, at unspecified dose for advanced parkinson&#39;s disease.  Medical history included maternal history of strokes, and paternal history of strokes, both on unspecified dates. Concomitant medication included carbidopa, levodopa taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Historical vaccination included first dose of BNT162B2 on 20Jan2021, intramuscular, with lot number: EL19261 for covid-19 immunization.  The patient experienced stroke on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, and facial droop on Apr2021 with outcome of recovering. Details were reported as follows: The patient felt like she experienced a mini stroke in Apr 2021. She had her Peg and J tube replaced on 16Apr2021 because they came completely out. Her husband was not sure if the pump was working states he could not saw the medication. Her husband had the pump disconnected from her. NCM advised her husband to run the pump over paper towels. Her husband did as instructed and could then saw the medication. He then connected patient to the pump and the pump ran without any error codes or alarms. Her husband wanted to make sure patient did not need a new pump since she got new tubing. NCM assured that the current pump seemed to be working fine with the new tubing. She left sided mouth droop in Apr 2021. She was taken to the local hospital via emergency medical services (EMS). She was then transferred to Hospital in for evaluation. She was in the ER awaiting a bed for 20 hours. The primary reporter did not know if any tests or medicine obtained as he did not receive any paperwork. After 20 hours, she was discharged from the ER home. She had a brain waves test a few days later to confirm if stroke had occurred. The primary reporter stated he did not feel the COVID vaccine was related to he events of Mouth droop and possible stroke. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included brain waves test: results pending on 21Apr2021.  The action taken in response to the event(s) for bnt162b2 was not applicable, and for carbidopa, levodopa was dose not changed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information provided, considering the age and medical history of the patient, the event stroke is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2. The event &#34;facial drop&#34; is assessed as symptom of the event stroke, hence not related to BNT162B2 either. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 83-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Feb2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation (at the age of 83 years). The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced right leg bothering her and mind went blank and she was unable to think of her email address to provide on an unspecified date, arm soreness and arm soreness was getting worse/arm was sore on 21Feb2021. The patient received her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 21Feb2021, and her arm was sore on the 21Feb2021 (that night) and on the 22Feb2021 (next day) but went away. The pain came back  two and a half weeks later, and her 2nd shot was scheduled for this 13Mar2021 (Saturday). It seemed like it was okay after the first two days, but now it was back. Her arm had been sore, all week; on 10Mar2021 (today) it was really sore. She also mentioned her right leg was bothering her (start date: unspecified), but she didn&#39;t think that&#39;s related to the vaccine. She did not know if it was like just really dull before and she did not really notice it. It seemed like it was okay, and all of a sudden, each day she felt a little sore and today was really sore. She confirmed after the vaccine she had arm soreness and the arm soreness was getting worse. On 13Mar2021 (Saturday), it would be 3 weeks since she received the first dose. She took ADVIL as treat-ment, and but it didn&#39;t seem to help (Usually, ADVIL helps her). She did have TYLENOL and wanted to know if you can alternate TYLENOL and ADVIL. While attempting to provide email she commented her mind went blank and she was unable to think of her email address to provide (start date: unspecified). In concern to height, she thought she had shrunk. She wanted to know if it was normal for the pain to come back after about 2 and a half, almost 3 weeks and since this arm was sore, will she have to get it in her other arm. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of arm soreness and arm soreness was getting worse/arm was sore. The outcome for arm soreness and arm soreness was getting worse/arm was sore was not recovered, and for another event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch cannot be obtained.

I came home and slept fine. After 7 days, I got hot spells and I keep taking my temperature. Sometimes it varies from 98.7-97.9. I started getting headaches and a lump in my neck after 3 weeks. I saw an ENT and he said these symptoms would go away. I was coughing and I asked my doctor to get a CAT scan. I had inflammation on my chest. It was last week that my PCP told me to see a pulmonary doctor. The disk that she had given him was not clear and that he couldn&#39;t determine anything. I have told my doctor about the weird headaches and acid reflux that I have been getting.

                                                I am an 83 year old female who was thought to have Guillain-Barre ca. 40 years ago.  I was paralyzed from the waist down, hospitalized, and had a very slow recovery.   This paralysis caused clawed toes that were straightened surgically and affected my balance and walking (I use two hiking poles as aids for walking and balance.)  Little was known at that time.    I received the first Pfizer Covid shot on April 18, 2021. Two days after I had the Covid shot, the nerves in my left leg, below the knee, were sore when pressed and the affected muscles felt numb. This has persisted and at times different nerves in my lower leg are affected.  Currently the muscles going down the back of my lower leg and around the ankle are affected.   Three nights after the Covid shot, I had severe left kidney pains, became violently sick and the following morning went to my health facility emergency care department. I had no previous kidney problems or signs of a UTI.  I had a CT scan of the kidney and was treated for a kidney infection and UTI with antibiotics. I have been to a kidney specialist and urologist with tests continuing.  My breathing was erratic for a few days and I felt nauseous for 2 weeks.  I have not had the second covid shot.

A 83-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: GWO196), via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 24Jun2021 at 04:00 (83-year-old at the time of vaccination) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included bl high cholesterol; reported that her body makes cholesterol, it is not what she eats. It is 350 sometimes, 300 is high. Asthma, swollen, blood pressure, allergy with some soaps, adhesives they have to put one with cloth that does not have the same qualities as adhesive or otherwise she gets a rash, history of stents for heart attack, couple of arteries clogged but not showing any signs of causing problems, cancer. The patient had allergy with some medicines like clindamycin, Percocet, Percodan, penicillins. Concomitant medications included amlodipine (AMLODIPINE, dose: 5 mg, 1x/day) taken for blood pressure; atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN, dose: 40 mg (she has been taking for years)) taken for blood cholesterol; furosemide (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE, dose: 20 mg (for three years. Not every day)]) taken for when her legs get swollen; salbutamol sulfate (VENTOLIN ACCUHALER) taken for asthma. It was reported that amlodipine was taken 3 or 5 years she has been on, but does not remember off hand, atorvastatin was taken maybe 8 years, it runs in her family everybody has it. She has been taking all her medications 50 years but not her cholesterol medication, for Lasix she is running like a chicken with her head cut off because everything that has happened to her. She takes 20, her daughter takes 40 mg not every day, for Ventolin when foggy outside she gets wheezy and when she is outside walking, she does one spray once and that is it. Years ago, she had bad asthma but not in the last 5 years except with weather. The patient previously took flu vaccine vii every year and experienced her arm hurt a little bit, coughing, chest hurt, did not have breathing thing, she got the flu, fainted. Reported that she was getting the flu vaccine every year, she takes it, and was okay the first time but her arm hurt a little bit and it never hurt. Two years ago, she took it and 2 weeks later felt sick like coughing and her chest hurt and she did not have breathing thing. Coughing and chest hurting led to her going to the emergency because she also fainted, so she called # and they took her to the hospital. She did tests and it was not her heart. They tested her for the flu and she said oh I already got my flu shot and they said well good thing you did. Caller confirms she got the flu after getting the flu shot. Reported that after experiencing labored breathing, chest pain, she called a cardiologist and went to the doctors and was admitted to the hospital for cardiac testing, and complains of labored breathing and fatigue. She wants this documented and has a history of stents in the past but hospital workup was negative. She had a heart attack 3 years ago and has stents in her heart.

She was taken by ambulance to the hospital and they did a bunch of tests and electrocardiogram and xrays and put her on monitor. After a few hours, they sent her to the cardiac floor where they gave her an injection, more blood tests, more of everything. The next day, nuclear testing of the heard and all of that stuff and sent her home and said it was not her heart and it was fine. She still had a couple of arteries clogged but not showing any signs of causing problems so they do not have to put a stent in. Caller confirms this was prior to receiving the vaccine because she has arteries clogged but only one with a stent and she still does not need a stent. No history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks.

Reported that Dr was afraid she was having a heart attack because she felt think someone was squeezing her chest and her breathing wasn&#39;t normal, so the hospital did all kinds of cardiac evaluation and they admitted her to the cardiac floor and continued to have all kinds of cardiac testing done, turns out her heart was okay, even though she has a stent in her heart and has 2 arteries that are clogged but they do not need to be fixed because there are not clogged to the point where it would cause her any problems, All the test showed that she did not have a heart attack. She has a lot of fatigue, if she walks from the bedroom to the kitchen, she really tires and feels like her breathing is labored, it&#39;s awful, and pains in the neck, even though before used to have a little pain in the neck, because has vertigo besides this but now has to be putting Ice packs constantly on the neck, waits and hour and then again and takes Motrin for the pain.

A 84-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration in Jan2021 at single dose for vaccination. Dose injection to left deltoid around 14:00. Medical history included car wreck, hypertension, scoliosis. Concomitant medication included ongoing celecoxib (CELEBREX) for car wreck, amlodipine besilate, benazepril hydrochloride (AMLODIPINE/BENAZEPRIL) from 2017 and ongoing for anti-hypertension. The patient reported she had the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine a week ago and it did not really bother her until she started trying to do exercises of her arm. On 15Jan2021 she had a swollen lump that is quite sore on her left arm that did not go down and it had been 3 days now. She did not have a fever, the area was not red, it&#39;s just swollen. She just wanted to know if this event was customary with the product; and if her second dose should be given in a different anatomical location. It was just painful and swollen; had not been hospitalized for this event. She could see the difference, she was quite wrinkled now with age; but at the site of her swollen lump on left arm she had no wrinkles right now. Her second dose is scheduled for 02Feb2021 at 14:20. The outcome of events was not recovered.

                                                I just got done going to the bathroom (2-4-2021) and was zipping up my pants  when I fainted.  I fell backwards into the bathtub  knocking down both shower doors.  My legs were hanging over the edge of the tub.  One shower door fell on my upper right chest area.   This happened just over 24 hours from when I received the vaccine.  I had not felt bad at all from the vaccine.  Didn&#39;t sleep too well that night (2-4-2021) because I hurt due to the fall.  I called my doctor on 2-5-2021 to let her know I fainted 24 hours after receiving the vaccine and wondered if that was due to it.  I do feel weak today (2-5-2021).

                                                Narrative: Patient with history advanced vascular dementia, hypertensive cerebrovascular disease and stroke, T2DM. Received her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 14:00 and was reported to have expired at home at 20:55. Dr. (Medical Director) spoke with patient&#39;s son/caregiver 2/4/21. Son reports that patient was in her usual health yesterday morning, deemed well enough by son to travel for vaccination. He reports she had no bothersome symptoms after either first or second vaccinations. Specifically denied rash, wheeze, and difficulty breathing. Son was with patient throughout the day. In the evening, when preparing for bed, he noted she became suddenly unresponsive in a similar fashion as she has done several times in past years. While in all previous such episodes she recovered within minutes, last evening she did not regain consciousness, experiences a brief period of labored breathing, and died. Patient&#39;s son called 911 and the patient&#39;s body was brought to the medical examiners. The medical examiner declined to proceed with autopsy. Patient&#39;s son is not interested in autopsy. Patient&#39;s son reports confidence that his mother&#39;s underlying hypertensive/diabetic cardiovascular disease is the natural cause of her death.

                                                Patient is a 84-year-old female presenting to the emergency room with anxiousness, generalized weakness and one episode of vomiting/nausea surrounding her Covid vaccination this afternoon.  On exam patient appears mildly anxious, has no evidence of allergic reaction, lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.  Patient is resting comfortably, speaking in complete sentences.  Shortly after physical exam patient was noted to have oxygen saturation of 90 to 92%, subsequently placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Will obtain CBC, CMP, chest x-ray, EKG.  We will also give patient 500 cc of fluid and 4 mg of Zofran for control of nausea and vomiting.  We will continue to monitor patient. No leukocytosis, no AKI, electrolytes within normal limits, chest x-ray without evidence of underlying pneumonia or pneumothorax.  I have reevaluated patient, patient has been reporting a ongoing headache for which she has a history of and takes Fioricet, requesting Fioricet.  Will order Fioricet.  We attempted to take patient off of her oxygen however when taken off the oxygen she drops to 88% on room air.  Patient reports ongoing generalized weakness and nausea which has required an additional 4 mg Zofran.  Given that patient has been monitored for couple of hours and has had ongoing nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness in the setting of hypoxia when taken off of oxygen will obtain troponins and admit patient to the hospital for obs.  I have spoken to Dr. who has accepted patient to observation with telemetry for further management.  Patient was informed of admission status, with no further questions at this time.

An 84-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number EL1284 and Expiration Date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 (vaccine location: left arm) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none.On Monday (11Jan2021) morning she had a lot of pain in her legs and knees that went down to her feet. She thought maybe it was arthritis, but it was still there and it still hurts. She can&#39;t hardly walk real good cause it hurts. She was wondering if it could be a side effect from that vaccine. She wanted to know if there been a reaction like this in other people. Supposed to get her second dose on 30Jan2021.  The outcome of events was not recovered without treatment involved.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

An 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm on 21Jan2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included oral cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received flu vaccine for immunization and reported that it made her sick for 10 days 4 or 5 years ago. The patient previously took Tylenol (takes 1 instead of 2, Everything she takes half the recommended dose). The patient experienced fast heartbeat, increased BP, weakness, dizziness, nausea and headache on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was further reported that she had a fast heart beat, her blood pressure went real high, she was dizzy and weak. This was while she was there and being watched for the 15 minutes by a nurse. She is 84 years old and doesn&#39;t take any medication; she did have oral cancer but with no chemo as it had not spread and this was 2 years ago. It was explained that the patient didn&#39;t feel good about it but she drove home. When she got home she was confused and felt like she could pass out. She walked through the house didn&#39;t know who she was, she just kept walking and walking. It was a strange feeling that lasted 15-20 minutes. She called her son late in the afternoon and told him to check on her to make sure she made it through the night. She still had funny feelings over the next few days but at this point she only has the dizziness that happens occasionally. She notes also that her blood pressure was checked at home by her and was higher than normal the first few days after but is now normal. Over the next day she had a headache and a little nausea, but it was not severe. She also mentions having a little soreness in her arm but not bad. She did read about the side effects and states she had the elevated heart rate, increase in blood pressure and dizziness right after getting it. The patient wonders could she ask for smaller dose, she only weighs about 110lb. When she spoke with her doctor she was told that the COVID virus is worse than what she experienced after the vaccine. She has not been to the doctor since getting the vaccine, she just talked to them. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: high and heart rate: fast on Jan2021. The patient was recovering from dizziness, the outcome of nausea was unknown and the patient recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

Fall, potentially acute encephalopathy / confusion, hypertension (potential for non-compliance with antihypertensive medications?) - patient with known severe to advanced dementia / mild cognitive impairment.  Likely related to hypertensive encephalopathy with post-COVID vaccine prodrome with underlying advanced dementia.  Situation: hospitalization after a fall and hypertension emergency Background: Pt is an 84 y/o female pt with a log history of dementia, has been able to live alone safely until most recent illness/hospitalization. Assessment: Pt received her 2nd COVID vaccine on Saturday.  On Sunday, pt&#39;s sister was unable to get a hold of her as her sister calls her daily due to her dementia.  After several phone calls, her sister went to pt&#39;s home and found pt on her bedroom floor.  There was   some blood found, not sure from where.  Sisiter was unable to get pt up so EMS was called and pt was taken to ED.  She was evaluated, her BP was very elevated, she was admitted and testing was done.  Head CT/MRI was unchanged.  X-ray of her R shoulder shows a vertical non-displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity of the proximal humerous, no surgical intervention is recommended at this time, pt instructed to wear a sling for now. Pt is discharged home with Home Care and family support.

                                                The second dose was really  my first covid vaccine shot.  That evening for both, I started aching a lot in both arms and shoulders, couldn&#39;t sleep and extremely tired the next day.  The following day I was back to normal and the symptoms gone.  The second shot had a little stronger symptoms. I had covid in early November, 2020 in case that matters.    Also, I had a flu shot late October and had a severe reaction which led to my being diagnosed with covid.

                                                She got the vaccine, she had no effects, and no reaction whatsoever. The husband had no side effects either.   On 3/16/21 they were on their way to go to bed and the bedroom is upstairs and she was fine, she was in the bedroom getting ready for bed, and her husband followed 15 minutes later and when he got upstairs she was sitting in a chair next to the bed, and he noticed that when he spoke with her that she did not speak clearly back, and was very low tone, not much loudness to her speech.  He didn&#39;t think much about it, and he talked with her again and noticed that she seemed to be having some difficulty talking, but he could understand what she was saying if he paid close attention.  He then realized that something was wrong, and asked her how she felt and she said she felt strange.  She was trying to take a pair of socks off and could not reach them.  She tried to lift her leg to put one knee over the other for her to remove them and was not able to do that.  He helped her take the socks off, she wanted to put some cream on her foot and was not able to do so, which is her usual routine.  He put that on her foot while he was talking to her, and her speech was different than it was earlier.  She was wearing a turtle neck shirt and was not able to take it off to get dressed for bed.  Her husband assisted in dressing her to get ready for bed.  He was thinking that she may have been having a mini-stroke.  She tried to get up from the chair and was not able to get up on her own.  He went to try to help her to lift her and it was hard.  When she did get her bottom up off the chair she stayed in a bent position and was not able to stand up.  He put her back down on the chair and tried some more times, and ultimately able to get up and he was able to get her into the bed (the chair was next to the bed).  She could sit on the edge of the bed, but was not able to move her legs on her own to get into the bed.  He struggled to get her in the bed and was not in a mood to talk and just leaned over on one side to try to go to sleep.  He told her he was going to get the walker in the basement for her to use.  He brought up the walker and put in by the bed, and informed her that it was there, and reached to see where it was in the event that she needed to use it through the night.  She did get up around 3:15 this morning to use the bathroom and her husband asked if she needed assistance, and she said that she was able to get up and go to the bathroom, and moved her legs just slow and was able to use the walker.  She was feeling much better at that time.  She got up one more time during the night and was not in need of the walker and was back to bed.  This morning when they got up at 8:00 Am and she was back to her normal self.   She came down the steps and was like nothing had ever happened.  They called her son who works in the hospital and he told them to call us to see if there were any other people that had the same reaction.    She stated while he was giving me this information that she did not recall a lot of the events that he was telling me.

In the morning, she was dazed, cold and walked to the bathroom, where she collapsed to her death. Paramedics could not revive her. My mom died Saturday morning - within the 24-hour period of her vaccine. She was feeling so great leading up to it, active, stripping the guest bedroom sheets, bubbly, and excited for us to be able to finally visit her soon.

A 84-Year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3949, NDC number: Unknown, Expiry Date: May2021) intramuscularly given very high in the top of left arm on 04Feb2021 9:20 AM at 0.3 ml single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included fractured skull (five years ago), shingles (two years ago) and bleeding ulcers. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE last 04Feb2021 at 9:20 AM - Same day 6:00 PM started to have achy arm - After a few days developed symptoms like extremely ill, extreme fatigue, nausea, muscle aches. DSU potential duplicate AE Report E transmit - According to the patient she had already reported the side effects and transferred to our department. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced arm started to ache like hell. Tiredness, muscle pain, nausea and feeling horribly ill. It was reported that, &#34;she was having some symptoms. She got her vaccination on the 04Feb2021 and developed the symptoms yesterday. Her doctor was very alarmed that it was not just usual symptoms that go along with the vaccine because of the length of time between when she got it and when she developed symptoms. He was afraid she had COVID. She needed to know if that was normal so she could get back to him. Caller clarified that she meant side effects. She wanted to know whether it was normal to have gotten the vaccine on 04Feb2021 and not develop side effects until 09Feb2021. The vaccination was given in the morning at 9:20 AM and she did not have any symptoms until 6:00 PM that evening. Her arm started to ache like hell. That one showed up then, but cleared up in a couple of days. The arm got better and better. The other set of side effects started yesterday which was tiredness, muscle pain, nausea, and feeling horribly ill. She felt awful and did not want to go to a hospital if it was not necessary. HCP information included she had only seen him a couple of times. She had a long term doctor that retired and she got shifted over to him. They did not have a good relationship she must say. His whole group was associated with where she got the vaccine. They were all virtual now. She had been on lock down for a year. She did not have the doctor&#39;s address, phone number, or email. Tiredness, muscle pain, nausea, and feeling horribly ill: started yesterday morning when she got up between 4:30 AM and 5:00 AM. She was so woozy and thought it was left over sleep. She felt unwell all day. She had felt unwell today, but not as bad as yesterday. She had to get vaccination card out of hand bag and needs her glasses to read the small numbers. First dose was given on 04Feb2021. She had appointment on 25Feb2021 for second dose. Healthcare Provider who gave the vaccine was Hospital. They called her on the third at 5:00 PM to see if she could come the next day for the vaccine. They did a good job. Her brother was a retired anesthesiology and she called him this morning and he said to go to the hospital or testing center. Then he agreed that she should call Pfizer. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect and additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect were none. She did not get her flu shot in anticipation of getting the COVID vaccine. Her brother and his granddaughter were both anesthesiologist. They get work up about not being able to breathe and ventilators. They gave advice. She was glad her brother approved for her to call Pfizer to find out. She wanted to believe it was side effects. She had been on lock down. Her brother said she could have been exposed at the vaccine site. Caller stated everyone had on a mask. She was not obese. She was not sure if it is relevant, but she would tell it anyway. She fractured her skull 5 years ago and was in Hospital because it was bleeding. That had resolved. She was in ICU and then six weeks of acute rehab. She had a bad case of shingles two years ago which led to bleeding ulcers. Again she went to the hospital, but she was scoped they found ulcers and treated. She went back for scope again and it had all healed up&#34;. Outcome of the event have achy arm was recovering whereas other events was unknown.

                                                suffers from asthma but never had the symptoms she&#39;s had now; shortness of breath; hoarse/ hoarseness; audible wheezing; doesn&#39;t have the energy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). This 84-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as 0.3 ml, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2019 and ongoing, when she would sleep her oxygen would drop, and shrunk from 5 feet 5 1/4 inches to now 5 feet 2 inches. She never found out why her oxygen saturations dropped at night but she does not have sleep apnea. Her saturations would drop down to the 80s and she would still be sleeping. Concomitant medications included ongoing albuterol [salbutamol] taken for asthma and oxygen taken for &#34;when she would sleep her oxygen would drop&#34; from 2012 and ongoing. Patient previously took Anoro and Qvar in Aug2019. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 25Feb2021 (lot number: EN6206, NDC:59267-1000-01, Expiry date unknown) in the left arm. With the first vaccine she did not have any symptoms, she thought she got saline. Only symptoms she felt were when they told her to wait 15 minutes and she sat there and when she got up and she was driving and had her window down her nose felt like it was swelling. She lost her sense of smell due to an injury and she had an acute sense of smell of tobacco from the car next to her. That is the only symptom she had. The acute sense of smell was about 30 minutes after she got her injection, about 5-7 minutes after that. She left about 10:30 am and it happened around 10:35-10:37 am. The acute sense of smell was short lived, it happened for a minute or two. Several years ago she had shoulder surgery and had her great granddaughter and she was playing with her and her foot got caught in the coffee table and she fell and her nose got cut and lost her sense of smell. When asked for seriousness criteria, patient stated it was significant because she had not been able to smell since 2011 and she had the sensation of her nose swelling. She felt like that but she was driving and could not look at her nose. She didn&#39;t have the feeling 15 minutes after the vaccine, she had been driving for 5-7 minutes and had the feeling and it was exactly when she got in the car. It was significant because she was able to smell something. Patient had her second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 18Mar2021 and had shortness of breath. She suffers from asthma but never had the symptoms she&#39;s had now. She did not seem to be getting better and the slightest movement, she&#39;s short of breath. She is taking the medicine that she normally takes but never had to take it this much. She was short of breath and not paying that much attention to it, when she goes out she wears a mask, since last year, and she went to put the trash out and had shortness of breath stepping out the back door. She was talking to a friend long distance and she told her she was so short of breath. To get out of bed and turn in bed she&#39;s more short of breath. The shortness of breath may have started before Friday 26Mar2021 but that&#39;s when she noticed it. She would have her mask on, park her car and go to the post office and when she would walk to her PO box, which is the first of the boxes, she was exhausted and not getting enough air and she noticed it. But then when she went outside to put the trash out, just a step outside she was short of breath, that&#39;s when she began to notice. She has never been this short of breath and her breathing and exchange of air has never been this bad. She thought she would maybe get her smell back and in all the years she&#39;s been diagnosed with asthma she&#39;s never had the wheezing and shortness of breath that she&#39;s had now. She&#39;s never heard herself wheeze. Monday night she was up at 3 am and got up to go to the bathroom and she was so short of breath. She had to take it at 3:30 am and that had never happened to her. She never had wheezing until the second vaccine. She doesn&#39;t need a stethoscope to hear the wheezing and that most people have asthma with wheezing but she did not. Patient was not taking the Qvar until after the second dose of the vaccine and was only using the albuterol before. She would take two puffs in her car and then put two masks before getting out. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No AE required a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was scheduled to see her primary doctor on 13Apr2021 but could not get in earlier and attempted to see her pulmonary doctor and the earliest she can is 07Apr2021 and she has that appointment. Patient was also very hoarse. From time to time medications like her inhaler for her asthma sometimes makes her hoarse. This time she has the hoarseness even when she doesn&#39;t take her inhaler. She has audible wheezing. She would not consider the shortness of breath life threatening but it is concerning because she is not able to do what she needs to do because she doesn&#39;t have the energy. Hoarseness is worsening because she is taking more of the medications she&#39;s normally taking and now she is taking the inhaler twice a day because she is more short of breath. The one inhaler she is using is Qvar. She has been taking the albuterol more also. Hoarseness is not life threatening, it is effective but it is not disabling. The more she talks, the more hoarse she gets. Relatedness of drug to reactions shortness of breath, very hoarse, by primary source reporter (Method of assessment: Global Introspection) was related. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Asthma aggravated and Shortness of breath cannot be excluded. Medical history of asthma may provide a plausible alternative explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

A 84-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL926F) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 10Feb2021 13:30 as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes that she was diagnosed with Lupus in 2004 and fasciitis in her foot in January2021. She had cortisone shot in her foot on 12Jan2021 and 08feb2021 within four weeks prior to vaccination. The patient previously took vitamin d2 &#43; calcium [calcium gluconate; calcium phosphate; ergocalciferol] 50mg once a week, cortisone for fasciitis on Oct2020 patient has taken flu shot and a booster for pneumococcal pneumonia however in past patient took flu shot and had flu.

On 10Feb2021 had first dose in her arm was barely sore. She did not feel sick or anything. About the second night (12Feb2021) after the first dose of the vaccine they were watching TV and she was sitting on the couch and noticed the small of her back was itching. It was just a little bit, and she did not pay attention because now and then she will have a little itch and did not notice it. She is calling back with questions about the same thing. Confirms that there are no new events. Since her first dose of the covid vaccine, on the second day after, that night, before she got in her bath, her back was itching. She did not pay it much attention. After her second dose of the covid vaccine, on the third day, she took her clothes off to take a shower and she had no rash, but she had chill bumps like she was cold. She read all of the information on side effects on the report. She saw where it said she could have chills. She had no problems with the injection or her arm being sore. She had no nausea, or no other symptoms that they talked about. Her skin felt like she had chills bumps from her knees to her shoulders. This has continued since. She does not have a reference number for her first report. She does not know when it went away/ over next day or 2. She told the person when got the shot that she had Lupus and asked if there was any reason, she should not get this. The nurse talked to somebody and came back and said no it would not affect it. It probably has not. She just wonders if there is something in the injection. She feels like that what caused her to itch since she has not changed her medications at all. The only thing which she came off this before she took the injection, was her rheumatologist advised all of her patients to take Vitamin D2 because of Covid. She was on that and was having some problems, the creatinine in her urine had gone up. They took her off it before she had the Covid injection. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatinine increased: increased on, blood calcium: increased. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 mRNA VACCINE BIONTECH), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 21May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0161) (at the age of 84-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Afib (diagnosed with Afib five years ago) and memory problems. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 mRNA VACCINE BIONTECH), dose 1 administered in Arm left on 30Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) for covid-19 immunisation and had lumps down the front of the arm. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.

The patient went ahead and received the second dose Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine and now its got the lumps going down it and they are tender. They are not really going down, still there. Wondering if there was some kind of anecdote to take care of it? The right arm was not as serious. The marks or lumps are sort of in the same places on both arms, like in the bend of the arm in the elbow. The patient doesn&#39;t know anyone else having this problem. Are these lumps on the caller&#39;s arms lymph nodes? The caller states she has been concerned about the lumps on her arms but not concerned enough to go to the doctor. The patient stated she has not talked to anyone at her primary care physician&#39;s office yet. The patient did not visited to emergency room or physician office. It was suggested the patient go to have the lumps looked at but the patient never did. The patient asked does Pfizer have options to get rid of the swelling, to treat it? Oh, Pfizer doesn&#39;t have anything for that, the patient was giving Pfizer a chance to treat it. No relevant tests done. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Around 4/19/21 pt started experiencing shortness of breath that increased to the point of gasping for breath on 4/25/21.  Her daughter (me!) visited and immediately called her pulmonologist who requested she immediately go to the hospital.  The ER said she had an enlarged heart, and was checked in to the cardiac unit.  Tests showed she had acute systolic and diastolic heart failure.  She was first put on diuretics while further tests were done, and Tikosyn was later added to her list of regular medications.  Within a week she was able to go home.  She was on oxygen prior to this event from the pulmonary fibrosis, and was able to return to her prior settings on her oxygen concentrator within five days, but her ongoing discomfort has stayed at a heightened level, and her level of activity has not returned to her normal.  Please note:  she is an 84 year old with pulmonary fibrosis.  It is not possible for me as her daughter (not a medical professional) to know if the original diagnosis of heart inflammation was related to her vaccination, but she had been relatively stable for more than six months prior to this hospitalization event and the onset of this sequence of events was identified by the doctors as being of unknown origin at that time.

A non-pregnant 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 13Apr2021 (at the age of 84-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidaemia (HLD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM2). Concomitant medications included regular prescribed medications for HTN, HLD, DM2 (drugs unspecified). No other vaccines prior to four weeks. Known allergies were unknown. No COVID prior to vaccination. Covid test post vaccination in May2021 was negative. The patient had no acute issues prior to her 1st COVID vaccine. In Apr2021, the started experiencing progressive weakness and poor appetite to the point of hardly being able to walk. The patient saw her primary doctor who ran some blood work and noticed she was dehydrated with mild elevated liver enzymes and WBC count. The patient was admitted to the hospital (for 21 days) for IV fluids and was on oral antibiotics. The patient started having some SOB and scans done indicated possible lung infection. The patient was switched to IV meropenem which did not help. The doctors also noted some lesions on her liver and a small mass in her lung (no biopsy was done cause she declined) which they said were suspicious for cancer. The patient then suffered a large ischemic stroke and she passed about a week later. The patient was feeling well before her vaccine and everything started to go downhill after her vaccine. AEs result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent covid test: negative in May2021. The outcome of events weakness, decreased appetite, unable to walk, dehydration, elevated liver enzymes, white blood cell count increased, short of breath, lung infection, hepatic lesion, lung mass, and lung cancer was unknown. The patient died on 27May2021 due to ischemic stroke and infection. An autopsy was not performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information  and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported suspicion on malignancy and BNT162B2 use is  unrelated while the causal relationship between the remaining events and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. There is limited information available which precludes a more meaningful assessment. However, the underlying conditions and the age of the patient maybe risk factors.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate; Reported Cause(s) of Death: ischemic stroke; infection

A 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EW0167), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 26APR2021 at the 84 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The medical history was ongoing high blood pressure, pain and allergic.  The concomitant medications were none. The patient states she goes to the doctor for a checkup for almost 1 year but she cant go because she wasn&#39;t able to go anymore because of corona virus and she didn&#39;t go out to visit her doctor for almost one year. The patient states she has high blood pressure, but she doesn&#39;t have medicine, it was diagnosed a long time ago because the doctor said take this medicine but she wasn&#39;t able to get a checkup and wasn&#39;t able to get the medicine so she doesn&#39;t have medicine. The patient would like to report a terrible effect on herself by the Pfizer vaccine. The patient states she had her first vaccine 26APR2021 and after that she had chest pain on 27APR2021  that lasted for the next day and almost 2 days and then her arm was also numb on 27APR2021  and she just put some hot and cold compress on her chest and she just rested and it just went away, but last week the same thing, her chest became painful and she saw this number about the Covid 19 and that&#39;s why she&#39;s calling, what should she do should she get the second vaccine? The patient states she did not report to anybody yet, this is her first time. The patient states last week, it came back again and then on the next day 27APR2021, it was very deep and painful in her knees, both sides, left and right above her knees. The patient states yes, sometimes its very painful. The patient states not now, but last week the pain was in her chest and she put a cold compress on it. The patient states after the numb and pain, its not like pain, its deep pain, that&#39;s why she&#39;s bothered. The patient states it&#39;s really serious, the knees, because of clotting or whatever so she tried to rub some alcohol on her leg, that&#39;s what she did. Chest Pain; very deep and painful in her knees: The patient states it&#39;s slowly not pain, it&#39;s not very painful like before, the first and second time that it occurred. The patient states it&#39;s pain, but it&#39;s like better, it&#39;s getting better. The patient states she cannot say that it&#39;s recovered, she feels a little better. The patient confirms it is ongoing and it is persisting. The patient states it&#39;s not worsening, she just feels it sometimes then it goes away if she massage it or applies pain ointment.Chest Pain: The patient states her chest is painful, the left side of her chest is very painful. The patient states she doesn&#39;t like to receive it because she said she might be allergic because sometimes she&#39;s really allergic, but all her friends said she needs to go now, she will be protected and of course she knows that like from the flu vaccine so she searched before she was able to see and she was going to get Moderna so she said she would look for a nearer place near her and so her friend told her to go to pharmacy because she has friends there that would help her and she went there and she got the Pfizer vaccine. The patient states that&#39;s because she did not have the pain before that for a long time for many years and now after getting the vaccine, now, she experienced it.

The patient was being treated with anticoagulant apixaban (ELIQUIS) currently. Caller stated that this could be that it (DVT) is from COVID, but her real question was, could it be from the vaccine? In Pfizer&#39;s information packet for patients, there is section on what to tell your provider prior to getting vaccinated. One of the things on there is if you have a bleeding disorder or are on an anticoagulant. There is no explanation as to why it was in the packet of information. Caller has looked everywhere and can not figure out why that is on the FAQ/packet information. The patient was due for the second dose on 13Jan2020, but she was worried and hesitant to approve it. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (PCR swab): positive on 26Dec2020, ultrasound of the left leg: confirmed DVT on 30Dec2020. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event &#34;COVID test (PCR swab): positive&#34; is related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The event occurred 3 days after vaccination, when vaccine was not expected to achieve the effect.  The event DVT of legs is not considered related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The patient had underlying diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, which are considered as risk factors for DVT. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history included dementia. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient popped hot 02Jan2021 along with 4 others on the hall she lived. Within 9 days 50&#43; patients were positive.

We were with her from 14Jan2021 to 18Jan2021. But had not been allowed to visit with her since Mar2020. And what post treatment pairs well with it? Publicly we hear Remdesivir and Bamlanivimab but these patients only received a general antibiotic and some vitamins. Death cause was Xrays showed covid Poss pockets all in her lungs on 15Jan2021. No autopsy was performed.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported event of positive for corona virus infection for the lack of efficacy of the vaccine. However, based on the mechanism of action of the vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine is given. Case will be reevaluated based on follow-up information; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Xrays showed covid Poss pockets all in her lungs on 15Jan

I was  totally bedridden for several days, getting up only for necessities  I lived on Ibuprofen.  I would get up, take two Ibuprofen, and sit for an hour before I could func.   My arm hurt.  The worst part is that my brain felt as if it were all swelled up, pushing against my skull.   I could not perform  normal tasks  at all ,  until the last couple of days.   I could not think, reason or remember at all until the last 2-3 days,  I had to get substitutes to teach my classes.  I could not write nor communicate  nor pay my bills.  I have a manuscript overdue.  I am now staying at night with friends, for neither they nor I trust me to function normally alone.

                                                I got the vaccine at 8 AM that morning and I was fine until about 5PM and I got very cold. I was freezing. I had a chill.  I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

Started abating by Thursday 2/25/21 evening. Advised ice pack on arm, but pt. said it was too sore on day after dose given (Wednesday) to apply. Pt. took one aspirin on Wednesday morning. Advised her she could take a second later in the day. (Yesterday pt. stated she had taken a Tylenol. Today upon review she realized that she took an aspirin. Ibuprofen is also available. Advised pt. take an ibuprofen now over the phone as I waited. Taken at 8:13pm EST. No further medication taken on Wednesday. (Also encouraged ice pack on neck Wednesday for ongoing strong headache / neck pain yesterday. Pt. does not remember if she tried that. Head/neck pain resolved today.) Pt. states swelling today (Thursday) is mild-to-moderate, less than yesterday, but still noticeable. Doesn&#39;t hurt as much as it did yesterday, she says. She can now lift her arm without pain.

                                                a little bit of arm pain/Her arm was a little amount sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 85-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 09:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Splenic marginal cell non-Hodgkin&#39;s Lymphoma of the B cells and spleen; infection in her bursae sack in her knee and she was in the hospital for that; she also had three infections. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that the shot was so simple, and she hates shots. It was the Pfizer shot given by a nurse at the clinic. Before bed on 01Feb2021, she thought her arm was starting to hurt so she took a pain pill. She doesn&#39;t think she needed it. She got the vaccine at 09:45 in the morning of 01Feb2021. She thought she had arm pain, but she didn&#39;t really ever get it. She didn&#39;t experience pain or anything otherwise. She also stated that she had a little bit of arm pain, her arm was a little amount sore. But it went away by the next day on 02Feb2021. It was very minor. She didn&#39;t feel like it was worth reporting. She felt it once in a while if she moves her arm but is not enough to mention. She hates shots, and this one wasn&#39;t as bad as half of the other shots she has had. She has no complaint about it. The outcome of the event was recovered on 02Feb2021.

A little white dot appeared where needle was inserted. Arm swelled. Initially thought it was common. But was not getting better and was painful and made her not feel well. She went to the doctors thankfully a few days after and was advised that it was infected. Could have been dangerous for her if infection continued to move through her body.   She is now on antibiotics. This is strange to have an infection which makes us feel the needle was not properly sterilized? Something foreign entered at the time of that shot and we would like to have answers. The doctors could not even identify why this happened.  Company Pfizer..

An 85-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot# EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 09:15 (at the age of 85-years-old) in right arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient had allergies and asthma for years. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported she got her first COVID-19 Vaccine on Saturday, 20Feb2021. She said she developed a rash on Monday (22Feb2021), and was very itchy. She said she didn&#39;t have the rash on her legs. She said she had the feeling of needles all over her entire body and face, along with a hot feeling on 22Feb2021. She said she was contributing her rash to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She asked if she got the second COVID-19 Vaccine, would the rash occur again, and would the rash be worse. The caller said she was scheduled to receive her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose on Thursday, 11Mar2021. The caller was advised she would be transferred to Pfizer Medical Information for further assistance. She had macular degeneration and had difficulty seeing in Feb2021. She clarified she felt like her face had needles going through it. She said her neck, chest, and upper back are a purple-red color on 22Feb2021. She said she was so uncomfortable that it was hard for her to wear clothes, and she had to sleep in the nude. Treatment: she was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and her daughter gave her an over-the-counter cortisone cream in a tube to use for her rash. She said she just started using the cortisone cream today (25Feb2021). She said she did not have the Benadryl and cortisone cream tube with her to provide the UPC/NDC Numbers, Lot Numbers, and Expiration Dates. She planned to call her doctor to see if he will give her something for the rash once she was finished speaking with Pfizer. The events did not require emergency room or physician office. Outcome of macular degeneration and difficulty seeing was unknown, and outcome of other events were not recovered.

                                                fainted; passed out and was unconscious; still kind of feel weak; bruise on both knees; fall; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable registered nurse (patient, Retired RN). An 85-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at single dose via an unknown route injection in left arm on 23Jan2021 around 08:15 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high which was controlled with medication, allergic to penicillin and acetylsalicylic acid;ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN).  She had lost weight and shrunk according to when she went to the doctor 2 months ago. No other products were taken. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect; no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine, no events following prior vaccinations. No family medical history relevant to the events. Patient passed out on her way home on 23Jan2021 (unknown time). The event required a visit to Emergency room, but not a Physician office. The event clinical course was as follows: She got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. Patient reported that after being monitored at the vaccination site for 20minutes, she left to go catch the bus and fainted before boarding the bus.  She remembered getting on the bus, but did not remember crossing the street. She passed out and was unconscious. An ambulance was called and they took her back to the hospital where she got the vaccine. She was taken by ambulance back to the ER, stayed for half the day, she received IV fluids, and a brain scan due to her fall. She stated that she still feels kind of weak as of 29Jan2021.  She did not know what time it happened, because she lost her sense of time on that day because she did not remember. When she got to the hospital she woke up and wondered where she was because she did not remember what happened. They got an x-ray of her head to see if she had bumped it, but it was negative. She did have a bruise on both knees. They gave her IV fluids, and kept her there for a little while, then sent her home. She called her doctor the next day, but he was busy, so she talked to the nurse. No treatment was recommended, just said to get a lot of rest. She was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 13Feb2021 and was scared to death. Patient verified that she was not admitted to the hospital. Investigation assessment were performed. They hooked her up to the monitor, did an x-ray and a CT scan while at the hospital on 23Jan2021 which were normal (both fine), and gave her IV fluids. Outcome of fainted, fall, passed out and was unconscious was resolved on 23Jan2021. Outcome of kind of feel weak was not resolved. Outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainted and unconscious cannot be fully excluded.  The underlying history of high blood pressure for this 85 years old patient  might provide an alternative explanation.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient medical history included allergic to different medications.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  It was reported that on 04Feb2021, the patient an hour after the vaccine developed a hoarse voice and two hours later felt like she had a big lump in her throat and had difficulty swallowing, their healthcare provider said he didn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction and was leaving it up to her if she wants to get it or not. The reporter stated her mother is allergic to different medications and those allergic reactions started the same way this did. The patient outcome of the events was unknown.

An 85-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021, 11:00 am as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, stroke, heart attack, COVID-19 in Aug2020 (actually had COVID this summer in August, had the mild case), and emergency surgery in Aug2020. Concomitant medications included ajmaline (CARDIA), isosorbide, and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for cardiac disorder; and losartan. The patient her first dose on 04Feb2021 and experienced headaches, muscle aches and pains, chills, other flu-like symptoms, heart conditions, and sensitivity to eggs. She mentioned that this was normal and nothing unusual. She received her second dose on 25Feb2021 at 11:00 am. She was still kind of stiff but was okay. The next day on 26Feb2021 at 11:00 am, she noticed bright red bleeding in her urine when she emptied her bladder. After a few hours it faded. On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Five days after shot stinging, burning pain, L side front and back from spine below waist around body, into groin area and under stomach, down front of L leg to knee.  Saw doctor on April 5, 2:p.m.  for signs of diverticulitis, given Flagyl and Cipro antibiotics, asked if there was  any rash. There was not.  Pain that evening radiated through entire lower half of body, burning of skin intense.  Went to ER. April 6, before 10:00 a.m., thinking I might have a ruptured diverticuli, for which I had major surgery 4 years prior.  CT scan returned a &#34;mild diverticulitis&#34;.  Rash appeared under skin on L upper thigh on 4/8/21, looking like measles spots.  Called doctor&#39;s office 4/9/21, thinking allergy to antibiotics given for diverticulitis.  My records showed I had been on both before with no reaction; nurse and doctor determined by description and having seen me earlier in the week that it was shingles.

On April 19, patient complained about left shoulder pain and went to see her general practitioner.  Tests were done to rule out heart issues.  On April 20, she called 911 and went to one of the two local hospitals, complaining of shoulder pain.  After an xray, the diagnosis was given as tendonitis and she was sent home and instructed to take 500mg Ibuprofen morning and evening.  On April 23, a rash became apparent on her left arm.  She had a follow-up appointment with her GP on April 27 and was  diagnosed with shingles.  She continued to get more uncomfortable and confused, and late on April 29,  a neighbor took her to the other local hospital where she was admitted.  A lumbar puncture test confirmed that she had herpes zoster virus in the spinal fluid.  She was treated in the hospital with acyclovir by IV and was released from the hospital on May 4 to a skilled nursing facility where she rehabilitated until May 14, when she was sent home.  She continues to be somewhat confused and has difficulty thinking of words - much more so than before her shingles episode.

                                                SUMMARY:  New onset of arthritis-like joint pain affecting bilateral fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees. Pain onset was temporally associated with the second COVID-19 vaccine shot. It began within one week of the shot and has persisted since then. &#34;At times it is extremely painful and throbs. It affects me at night and sometimes the pain keeps me awake, but it is especially bad in the mornings. Sometimes I have pain both in pulling the blanket over me at night and taking it off in the morning. It has gotten so bad that I dread getting up each day. Some days I can barely get out of bed. I do feel better after I am up and moving around. Oddly, the pain moves from one area to another, affecting different joints in my body. It doesn&#39;t stay consistently in the same joint(s). It is really weird. I&#39;ve had occasional aches before, such as in my lower back, but I have never felt anything like this. It is definitely new and came on all of a sudden. I believe that the vaccine triggered something in my immune system that has caused this new joint pain. CHRONOLOGY: I had my first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot on February 10, 2021. Three weeks later,    I had my second shot on March 4, 2021. Ever since then (beginning approximately on March 10, 2021), I have had these new and very bizarre aches in my joints.   It started in my left fingers. They felt extremely stiff in the mornings and I had numbness and tingling in my hand. It felt like I couldn&#39;t even move it. It was weird. I have never felt anything like it before. It&#39;s not you usual &#34;pins and needles&#34; when your arm &#34;goes to sleep.&#34; Shortly after that, it affected my right hand too. Some mornings it is almost impossible to straighten them. They are so stiff that I feel like I am going to break them if I move them. It didn&#39;t happen every morning at first, but it is becoming more consistent, over time. Once I get up and start moving in the morning, the joint pain usually goes away. Sometimes, I have a shooting pain in my hands and I think there may be nerve damage. I have also noticed that my grip strength in my hands has decreased. My hands are much weaker than they used to be.  In addition to my bilateral fingers, this new arthritis has affected my bilateral wrists, elbows, and my right shoulder.  When I saw my PCP on April 6th, 2021, my knees were not affected because I remember being able to get up from a seated position very easily. My doctor even commented on how agile I was. That has generally been true for me over the years. In the last month, though, since approximately June 15th, 2021 my knees have started to be affected by the same pain and stiffness. I notice it especially when I am getting up from a seated position. I have to hold onto something for support. Then, on approximately July 1, 2021, the pain and stiffness also started affecting my left shoulder.  My right shoulder bothers me less now. It is very strange how the pain seems to move around from one area to another. So far, it has not affected my neck, my hips, or my feet.   When I saw my PCP on April 6th, 2021, it was because I was having a lot of fatigue and I felt short of breath. I also told him about my joint pain and how I thought the vaccine caused it, since it seemed to start right after the second dose, but he dismissed it as being arthritis. I knew, however, that this was new for me and that I had never had it before. When I saw my Pulmonologist shortly thereafter, I told her about my symptoms and how I thought the vaccine had caused them. She said, &#34;It absolutely could be.&#34;   The most severe pain I have experienced to-date has been in my right wrist. I remember a sharp pain one day in February 2021, when I was trying to twist an ice cube tray. I do not recall if this was before or after my first vaccine shot on February 10, 2021. The tray was frozen pretty solid and it was hard to twist it to get the ice cubes out. I am left-handed and I remember that my right wrist was sore for several days afterwards. That right wrist pain still comes and goes. Sometimes I feel it every morning for a while, and then I won&#39;t.  I have kept my wrist wrapped in a bandage and I am careful with how I use it, but I must have done something to aggravate it, because on Monday morning, May 24th, 2021, I got up to go to the bathroom and my right wrist hurt a lot. I had a hard time pulling up my underwear and pants. My right shoulder bothered me too. I got back into bed but I had a hard time pulling the covers back up over me. The pain worsened. It was almost unbearable and I was in tears. My husband got up a little later to go use the bathroom. He asked if I was okay and I said, &#34;No, my wrist is killing me and I cant go back to sleep.&#34; He brought me hot washcloths to wrap around my wrist and this helped. He must have brought me fifty hot washcloths. The next morning, I called my PCP and asked for a referral to see a rheumatologist. I have an appointment pending on August 5, 2021.   Then, on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, my right wrist pain was excruciating. I contacted my PCP and made an appointment for the next day. The pain subsided a bit and I kept my wrist wrapped. I was careful with how I used it, but the pain started up again in the morning after I got dressed. I was in tears because it hurt so much. I couldn&#39;t even touch it. It was swollen. I had trouble moving my right 4th and 5th fingers too. I used a heating pad and took Tylenol and they helped to take the edge off, but it still hurt. I wondered if I had a fracture or a torn tendon or ligament. I asked my doctor to give me an order for imaging so that I wouldn&#39;t have to go through the ER. The A.P. x-ray of my wrist did not show any fractures, but my doctor wrote in his note that there is a &#34;deformity&#34; in the wrist. I have tried a topical pain reliever, Aspercream, with minimal relief. I have not had the excruciating pain in my right wrist since May.   I had hoped that the arthritis-like pain and stiffness would gradually go away with time, but it has persisted, off and on. Most mornings, I continue to have pain. I am now afraid to get a booster shot of the COVID vaccine if one is need because I don&#39;t want my pain to get worse.&#34;

An 86-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EC9231, expiry date Apr2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from 13Apr2020 and she got a plasma donation, in Apr2020 because she was not in good shape when she had COVID. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported) on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter said that the patient&#39;s doctor told her to still get the COVID vaccine and on 10Jan2021, she had been throwing up, sweating, and lightheaded and these were the side effects with the second dose. The caller stated that no one else had side effects like these. It was reported that the patient had no other family and the reporter felt really bad for the patient and wanted to get her some sort of information. The patient said that she was feeling a little better than she did last night, but she was laying in bed. The patient&#39;s symptoms started yesterday 10Jan2021, the next day after receiving the vaccine. The reporter said that the patient can barely speak to her. She said that the patient said that she was feeling a little better, but she just whispered it. The reporter asked if it was because the patient had antibodies. Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 21Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes therapy on her back from the past, from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included melatonin to sleep and, paracetamol (TYLENOL) to sleep. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Jan2021 at around 2:50 PM, the next morning on 22Jan2021, she felt extreme exhaustion, she&#39;d get up and have to get back to bed, not able to eat, and she thought she has low blood sugar. She got up and had a bowl of cereal. On an unspecified date, the patient also reported numbness in face, legs and slight headache, and need to eat all of a sudden or pass out, and these has gone on for five days now (at time of report). The patient also reported that her lip has a slight droop on left side of her face which was concerning her. The patient reported that after numbness and not eating, she had some ice cream and her whole chest froze up, and it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest felt like ice which never had happened before. It has been an effort to talk, she was really working hard to talk. The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 25Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for protection against virus. Medical history included COVID from 18Nov2020 and ongoing (recovering/resolving). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry: Mar2021) intramuscular in the left arm on 04Jan2021 for protection against virus with no problem. On 26Jan2021, patient had one tiny blood blister but now was covered in them. Her hands, feet, and torso are covered and are painful. The patient has trouble with ambulation and using her walker since. The palms of her hands are covered front and back too. The patient was also covered on her toes and areas of the abdomen around the umbilicus area. Had the first dose on 04Jan2021 and the second on 25Jan2021. Her mother has an appointment on 03Feb2021, and caller wanted to know if this is uncommon or a rare side effect. The reporter has found a couple of articles, but most of them refer to pediatrics and rashes and she didn&#39;t see any side effects about blood blisters for her mother&#39;s age group. Further stated that areas covered are progressively worse and disabling since her mother was using a walker to ambulate. Has not been able to really use the walker due to the soreness and tenderness of palms. Her mother had the disease (COVID) back on 18Nov2020 and was symptomatic and was mild. No other vaccines received the same time. No history of problems with vaccines in past. They can&#39;t think of nothing that was new, no new medications, lotions, creams, or detergents, nothing new. The events did not require a visit to emergency room nor a physician office. Onset date of events reported was on 26Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered. The reporter assessed the seriousness of events as disability. The events were assessed as related to vaccines.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                left arm painful; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 03Feb2021 at 12:05 (at the age of 86-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient had no family history related to the adverse events. The patient had no prior adverse events to vaccinations nor any prior vaccinations within four weeks of vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same day. The patient experienced left arm painful on 06Feb2021, which was reported with disability. The clinical course was reported as follows: The first 3-4 days (as reported), there were no side effects; however, her arm was painful for days 5- 7, and on day 9, it was still a little sore but better. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event, which included a visit to the chiropractor. The clinical outcome of left arm painful was recovering. The primary reporter (patient) assessed the causality between the event and the suspect product as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a causal relationship between event &#34;left arm painful&#34; and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

An 86-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL9262 expiry date 21May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 86 years old) at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL8982) on 22Jan2021 at single dose in upper right arm and on 22Jan2021 experienced severe headache and arm hurting. Relevant medical history includes ongoing compromised immune system diagnosed many years ago, and ongoing one kidney functioning. The patient received no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021 the patient experienced high, over the top blood pressure, delirious incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware which both required hospitalization from 13Feb2021 to 14Feb2021. It was also reported they were concerned about one kidney/ was dehydrated in 13Feb2021. On 13Feb2021 unspecified blood labs showed kidney was extremely dehydrated and Chest X-ray was good. Clinical course was reported as follows: she was just released from hospital yesterday, she took the second Pfizer COVID shot, on 12Feb2021, and became so very very ill, she expected some side effects, the first shot wasn&#39;t bad, the first all she had was a severe headache and arm hurting, but that was 3 weeks ago, and the second one she can&#39;t say how horrible it was: she had to get the paramedics there, she was very very ill. It was the worst night she has had, and she is 86 years old, and has had a multitude of serious issues but that shot was the worst. It was a combination of high blood pressure, over the top, and insomnia like she couldn&#39;t budge and open her eyes, she couldn&#39;t see anything but squares, it was like a horrible, if there is such a thing as a trip, a horrible trip, something she can&#39;t imagine wishing on anyone. The county administered it, she has several doctor, she initially provides her primary care doctor, for consent to contact, but says her nephrologist would be better, as she hasn&#39;t seen her primary care doctor in some time. Her primary care doctor doesn&#39;t know she had this, another doctor gave her permission, her nephrologist. States they were more concerned in the hospital about her kidney, she has one kidney functioning and, on mistake of the hospital, they didn&#39;t connect her to hydration, the night nurse didn&#39;t, and she was dehydrated and it was affecting her kidney. Her husband tried to call Saturday, when she had this reaction at like 06:30/07:00, but there was a huge long wait, he was calling to see about side effects, but they were beyond waiting, had to get the paramedics, her blood pressure was 178/113 and heart rate was 103. First shot was 3 weeks back. It looks like she had it on 22Jan2021, the headache and arm hurting started towards the evening, the shot was taken earlier in the day, and they started in the evening, her headache was quite severe, but with Tylenol it went away, the arm is still sore from the second vaccine, but is slightly better. Clarifies she was hospitalized for the blood pressure and delirium, like, it is best explained, like delirious: incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware, all she could see was, like if she talked about people who did LSD and trips, it was a bad trip, it was squares, she wanted to open her eyes, but could only see squares. She fell asleep Friday night about 11PM, and felt this at 04:00, and she pulled off her sleep apnea mask, she had to run to the restroom, she was weak, feeling like she would slip onto the floor, and had to get right in bed, and the insomnia continued until about 7AM, that was when she started to be able to focus on like words, she was able to say words in her mind, it was like a bad nightmare. She was admitted to the hospital, she was in the emergency room (ER), the paramedics took her there Saturday, about 07:30, took her to the hospital after immediate heart checking, an intravenous (IV) of some kind, and brought her to the hospital and she was in X-rays and what not, they did procedures in the ER, and they suggested her to be observed overnight, they watched her and things started to become more normal, but she is still not clear headed, she is woozy, like foggy. High, over the top blood pressure outcome: It has been back to a good blood pressure. Insomnia is ok- she slept ok last night. What is left: the night she woke up, so early Sunday morning, in the hospital, she was profusely sweating like someone came to her room and showered her bed with water, her sheets and blankets were soaked and this morning she woke, she got up, was still very woozy, and asked her husband to help get her out of bed, and she changed her nightgown and after an hour she got in the shower, as she was sweating again, not sweating, but occasionally on and off chills, she is taking off her nightshirt and putting on a bed jacket, she gets warm and cold, hot and cold. She had blood labs a chest X-ray, heart monitor the whole time until she was discharged, and everything was good except the kidney was extremely dehydrated. This was all on Saturday as well. On her first visit to get the vaccine, at that time, the facility was a big mall, and they handed her what to look for after the injection, and she didn&#39;t notice until this morning, it says if you have an immune system that is compromised, it could affect it, and she has immune system that is compromised diagnosed many years ago. Over the top blood pressure and insomnia had resolved, arm sore was resolving, dehydrated and affecting kidney had not resolved, final outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

An 86-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL8982 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 27Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medication. The patient experienced, after she pulled put from getting it, she got shaky on 27Jan2021. It went way after about 5 minutes. She gets that when gets a shot for dental work, so maybe it was the same reaction her body does, but it was gone before got home. On 27Jan2021, she had a sore arm for about 4.5 days, and it was difficult to sleep on that arm which was very sensitive to touch, and it turned a little red on 28Jan2021. She noted the soreness that night. She can lay on it now, it was sensitive in the center where the shot went in, but not bad. She was also tired that evening of 27Jan2021. She doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with it, but she got a cold sore, when she is stressed she gets a cold sore on her lip. This was noted yesterday (01Feb2020). She has medication for it from the doctor, and had to take for 3 days, and it usually clears it up. The cold sore was blistering, but she was susceptible to them with stress, so she was not surprised. Patient recovered from the event of tremor on 27Jan2021, turned a little red on 01Feb2021 and tired on 27Jan2021. Event sore arm was recovering while for the remaining events was unknown.

Lot of pain right side of face like:  1.  toothache, whole jaw aches   2.  neck arthritis   3. sinus infection  4.  ear infection all at the same time.  Strong pain all through right side of face, sometimes up through eye.  Worse lying down.  Cause?   Dental exam complete mouth x-rays indicated no problems with any teeth.  Saw Dr. 3/3/2021, was checked for ear, sinus infections, felt all around my neck, no problems.  Prescribed gabapentin, told to continue the Tylenol Arthritis I had been taking on my own.  Symptoms continue today, only right side of face, head, temple area, sometimes up through right eye, teeth on right side ache.  Only take the Tylenol once a day since that is all that I need it.  More painful if I lie down in bed at night so sit upright until pain is gone; then sleep through the night.  No problem all during the day when I?m up and around doing whatever. . .no pain then.  Someone in my dental office has the same symptoms along with Bells Palsy, was told by her doctor it&#39;s from the Covid shot and could last 3 months? Pharmacist also told me filling the gabapentin for several others with same symptoms (I live in a small town).

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

An 86-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed in 1971 (reported as 50 years ago) and ongoing; type 2 diabetes in 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) which resolved in 2019 (about 2 years ago) after the patient lost some weight; she had an episode of A-Fib in 2019 when her potassium was low (lower than the current hospitalization), once the potassium was corrected, her A-Fib resolved. The physician stated that patient has shrunk and was now about 5 foot 2 inches. Clarified that this has not recently occurred since the vaccine; stated it was happening just with age. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any issues with the first dose of the vaccine. She received her second vaccine dose on 24Mar2021. The physician spoke with the patient on Friday, 26Mar2021, and the patient was fine. On Saturday, 27Mar2021, the patient had an episode of diarrhea, vomiting and was weak. The lady cleaning the patient&#39;s house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient&#39;s son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her. Since the reporter was a physician, she knew which questions to ask the patient and saw that she still had some problems. The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient&#39;s potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021. The clots must have come from the heart valves since the carotid studies were fine and if the clots had been in her legs, they would&#39;ve gone to her lungs not to her brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: negative, potassium: low, carotid studies: fine, MRI of the head: multiple small emboli in brain, all on Mar2021; and potassium: low, height: 5 foot 2 inches (shrunk), and weight: lost, all on an unspecified date. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness and fall required emergency room visit. The outcome of the event difficult walking was recovering and unknown for all other events. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fall, potassium low, cerebral embolism, thrombosis, and &#34;potassium dropped and she went into A-Fib and threw clots&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and being life threatening; and the events aphasia and gait disturbance were assessed as serious due to hospitalization. All other events were non-serious. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 until 02Apr2021.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ET7534), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (at the age of 86years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, blood pressure high, multiple sclerosis, and wheelchair user; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing baclofen (10mg, three times a day), metformin (750 mg, twice a day), amlodipine besilate (10mg, once a day), losartan (50 mg, once a day), magnesium (two times a day), metoprolol (50 mg, 3x/day), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12), and glimepiride (takes 1mg in one meal and as another meal she takes half of a mg); and Statin (unspecified) 10 mg, once a day; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine on 18Mar2021 and she did fine but an hour later when she got home, the reporter tried to help her up off of her wheelchair onto another chair and she could not stand. She had extreme weakness and then she felt like her throat was, like somebody was choking her, like their hands around her throat and then her jaw felt like it was getting huge. Then, her blood pressure went up to 170, the patient was given lots of continuous water and blood pressure pill. She started to feel better after that. The reporter further stated, &#34;She has had various different problems. I do not know if it is allergies or what from what she already has but she did have a lot of it and exhausting stuff afterwards. There is mainly that choking feeling that is frightening that she had one hour after&#34;. It was also reported that the patient developed some rash on her back and hives on her legs. It was not right away. It was kind of a day or two after. The outcome of events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts needed. Further information is expected.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 16:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing multiple sclerosis , ongoing hypertension, ongoing diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing stent placed and spasms; and from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously had flu shot and feel a little bit sick, it hit her lot harder with the flu shot. Concomitant medication includes, unspecified, diabetic and hypertensive medication and medication for spasms. On 25Mar2021, 45 minutes to an hour after the patient&#39;s first dose, the patient felt like someone was choking her and felt like her jaw was &#34;getting large&#34; without physically getting large. The patient was not able to get out of her wheelchair, even though she was normally able to do so on her own, and her blood pressure systolically reached 170. Her mother was given &#34;excess water&#34; and was given her hypertensive medication &#34;a little early&#34; which caused her pressure to come down quickly. Based on this reaction that her mother had, caller would like to know if it was safe for the patient to receive her second dose of the vaccine. They stayed about 15 min at the drive thru to make sure there was no reaction. It was about a 30-minute drive home with traffic. It happened within the hour, right when she got in the house. The patient had a reaction to the first dose, and the caller wanted to know if it was safe for her to get the second. Within the first hour the patient felt like someone was choking her, she felt like her jaw was swelling, she felt extreme weakness and could not stand, and her blood pressure shot up. It shot up to 170, but she did not know the diastolic. The patient felt like she was choking so she was doused with water to push anything through in case that would help. Within a couple of hours, the patient started to feel better. They gave her excess fluids and gave her blood pressure medication a little bit earlier and everything came back down. She was frightened when this first occurred. The feeling of choking and the feeling of jaw swelling got better and went away within a few hours. The patient had multiple sclerosis so weakness is always an issue and mobility is always an issue. She knew her tolerance and what she could do. That day they had taken her in a wheelchair from the car to the house and she could not get out of the wheelchair, which was not normal for her. This happened within an hour of the shot. The weakness lingered the longest. That side effect did linger. It took a couple of days. She was using a Hugo again to get herself around the house and believes this extreme weakness has gone away. She was exercising on a stepper when the caller was talking to her. Caller did not believe there had been any lasting effects. Blood pressure shot up: Started within an hour of the vaccine. She had been hypertensive for quite some time historically. Her medication had been keeping it under control. They administered her dose early that day and it brought it down, it did not linger. The patient had been housebound since the pandemic started. The outcome of the event blood pressure shot up was recovering, while the outcome of the event couldn&#39;t stand was unknown; and the outcome of the rest of the events was recovered on 25Mar2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

By the 4th day, her legs would not hold her when she tried to stand getting out of bed.  She was nauseous to the point of not being able to eat or drink.  Infact, she did not have the strength or desire to eat or drink.  By the 5th day post vaccine (02/20/21), I took her to the Emergency room because she was so fatigued, she just slept, and couldn&#39;t stay awake to eat or drink.  She was able to get to the car with a walker, but that was the last time she walked.  After time at hospital and then Skilled nursing, she passed away on 03/21/21.  She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.  Her fatigue was just overwhelming. When she first arrived at the emergency room, she: ? Presented with 2 days of weakness and AMS; fever, nausea  and generalized fatigue ?

This 86 years old female patient received the second single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6203) on 04Mar2021 at 11:00, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 vaccine intramuscular, on 11Feb2021 at 18:30 (lot EN6201). The patient received some years ago an unspecified pneumonia vaccine and an unspecified tetanus vaccine experiencing after both headache, swollen arm and rash. She didn&#39;t react to the flu vaccine. Her body didn&#39;t want any more vaccine. Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, maybe a week or two after the second vaccination, early to mid afternoon, the patient had what felt like a charley horse in her lower leg while walking, but didn&#39;t pay any attention to it, just put ice on the leg. She then got sciatica in her leg on 24Apr2021 and couldn&#39;t walk; that was what sent her to the hospital as it was getting worse and she went to the hospital because of the pain. She just ignored it for at least a week but she was still having pain after the second week and could hardly walk due to the sciatica in that leg. At the hospital they found she had a blood clot in the calf of her leg on 28Apr2021. She was hospitalized from 28Apr2021 to 02May2021. The doctors in the hospital recommended that she should report her experience even though they didn&#39;t know if it was due to the COVID vaccine due to the proximity. The hospital doctors took care of her but her primary care provider knew that she had been in the hospital. The doctors gave her medications in the hospital that helped the pain in her foot and the sciatica but her lower leg/calf still hurt so they decided to do an ultrasound and found a blood clot. The patient still had to give herself injections in the belly for blood thinner to treat the blood clot. The patient also experienced soreness in arm on an unspecified date in 2021. Sciatica required ER visit. Blood clot was resolving. The other events outcome was unknown. The doctor said that there was a possibility that the blood clot could be related to the COVID vaccine, but it may not be related at all.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, including a prolonged onset latency of nearly two months, it appears unlikely that BNT162B2 contributed to the reported events. These are likely intercurrent medical conditions in this elderly patient. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) :PFIZER INC-2021501847 same patient/drug, different vaccine dose/AE

                                                The day after the first shot, my mother had bad knee pain in her left knee. It went on for days/week. After the second dose, days out she started feel very tired and bad pain in her feet that went to her hands and she couldn&#39;t get out of bed or urinate properly. Her facility doctor gave her Gabepentin for the pain but it did not help. She declined over a week or so and then She was admitted into the hospital for dehydration (March 19, 2021). The put a catheter in her to get urine out and bring her kidney function back to her normal (she does have kidney disease). Gave her more Gabepentin (which does not help pain in feet an hands) and released her to rehab. and she is now on oxygen.  Rehab was bad so I got her out and released to her facility so she could receive rehab there. She declined again with the same reaction: extreme fatigue, can&#39;t walk and now urinates and defecates in an adult diaper and now breathing is very labored.  She was admitted to the hospital and they can&#39;t find out why she is in this way. They did blood work, tests, scan and X-rays without any answers. They switched up meds on her and then released her to rehab since she hasn&#39;t walked in weeks/month at this point. She is regaining strength but now on oxygen even when sitting. She is 86 and walked with a walker all around her facility and when going to doctor appointments. Now she is in a wheelchair for doctor appointments since she has no strength and needs oxygen to walk. Her facility saw her decline after the second shot and my mom is very vocal and each day told them how she felt awful and it is because of the shot. She still has neuropathy in her feet and hands but it is not as painful as it originally was and it peaked and now just painful about a 5-6 on a scale of 0-10.

After the first dose she do not even feel anything, had no reaction to that. The second dose hurt when it went in, but she thought it would go away. So for about 3 weeks she was fine after that. Starting on unknown date in Mar2021, about 3 weeks after she was administered the second dose her arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed. It continued that way. Her arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too which still was not returned totally. Events are ongoing, still every once in a while would come back like a toothache; people say it would go away. She asked the expected duration of events; and if potential third dose is or is not recommended relative to events. Patient thought she was about 5 feet and keeps getting shorter, used to be more than 5 feet tall. But she vacuums, moves things around, trying to do what she should do; but events are continuing and she just wondered how long it would continue yet before it went away. Doctor said they would get a third dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, and she do not know whether she should relative to these events. The reason she got the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine doses in the right arm is because 2 years ago when she got the flu shot patient had a reaction where site was very red; so she thought she was not going to get injection in the left arm again because she is left handed. She knows that not supposed to get other vaccines, so she has not gotten the vaccine for shingles. The harder she tries to remember the worse it is, then she remembered vaccine for shingles. The physician put cortisone in her shoulder because he said it was something else, that he really do not think it was from the shot. She thought well she has had no accident, no fall, no bang, nothing to produce this other than the shot. He looked at it and gave her some exercises to do, so she was going to continue with therapy at the clinic; she goes to see the lady next week. Before all this happened it was going on and on and on. She had a problem with her knee on left side which the doctor looked at during that appointment. After the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine was administered, about 6 weeks ago she was working out in the yard. She do not think it had anything to do with the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included x-ray: unknown results on unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of calling to report pain, weakness to right arm, second dose hurt when it went in, arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too, twisted her knee a little bit/folding chair came down and slammed down onto her knee, deep bruise, arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed, arm just reacted strangely, she hasn&#39;t gotten the vaccine for shingles, could only remember the itchy thing, problem with her knee on left side. The seriousness of the events was medically significant. The clinical outcome of arm had also sort of lost the strength in it too, deep bruise were recovering, of the arm just reacted strangely, ache, hurt like a toothache just where the vaccine had been placed were not recovered, of the calling to report pain, weakness to right arm, hurt when it, second dose hurt when it went in, twisted her knee a little bit/folding chair came down and slammed down onto her knee went in, she hasn&#39;t gotten the vaccine for shingles, could only remember the itchy thing and problem with her knee were unknown.

Reporter is an 86-year-old female consumer who has received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She is calling today to inquire about whether she should receive the second dose. She states that she has 4 autoimmune disorders, and she thinks she may also have Parkinson&#39;s disease. She is concerned that the vaccine might worsen autoimmune disorders. She states that she has Lichen Sclerosus, spinal stenosis, trigger finger on the right hand which started after she received the Pneumovax23 vaccine last year, spinal stenosis, difficulty walking and dry mouth. She does not take any prescription medications.

The caller then went on to report that &#34;the day after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine my left ankle was itching me like crazy. It was a strange kind of itching. It was bothering me, I don&#39;t know and then it went away. She also reports developing a rash in the middle of her chest about 2.5 weeks after the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She noticed it this past Sunday 02May2021 and she describes it as, looks light pink, little teeny tiny bumps, middle of the chest near the neck. Reporter wants to know if the itching and rash that she experienced with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine have been reported before. The reporter stated that she is concerned about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine because she is worried that it could make her autoimmune disorders worse or that she could develop new autoimmune disorders because of the vaccine. Reporter asks how long she can postpone or reschedule her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine until she speaks with her doctor. Reporter stated that she heard 6 million people have not returned to receive their second doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and wants to know if we have information as to why they chose not to proceed with the second dose. Reporter stated that she is thinking about not getting the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled this Thursday and waiting until September, October or November and just get the booster shot like they are talking about. She wants to know what this agent thinks about that plan. Reporter stated that she has heard getting the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine can cause swollen lymph nodes and that concerns her. Responded per page 2 of the attached document, Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), which generally resolved within 10 days, is likely to have resulted from a robust vaccine-elicited immune response. She is transferring her to report adverse events she experienced after the dose of the COVID vaccine. Two weeks after her 1st dose she felt chills and swelling in her lymph nodes. she has questions about the efficacy of the second dose. The caller clarified the details provided by the transferring agent. She did not have chills.

It is on air-condition because she will be away. The last lady said chills it wasn&#39;t chills. She just felt cold. Her nose is stuffed up but was way before the shot. It will be 3 weeks ago tomorrow that she got the vaccine. The cold feeling happened two weeks after the first. The second shot is due tomorrow. She is wondering if she should get it. She noticed she started to feel cold 2 weeks after her first Pfizer vaccine. Is that normal to feel cold. She didn&#39;t think about it being the Pfizer vaccine when she got cold. She used to be 5&#39;4.5 but is now 5&#39;0. She got the vaccine at the see formal field Her doctor told her to go to the hospital to get it not a drug store. She waited 30 minutes.

She got the vaccine at 1130 am. She didn&#39;t even feel it. She didn&#39;t have pain in her arm at all. It was like she got no shot at all. She is a little tired now. She needed to take a nap in the last couple of days. This started a couple of days ago. It has almost been 3 weeks wince her first one. see formal field She is wondering if it is normal to have 2.5-week later side effect. She did have a rash on her chest 3-4 days ago, but that was reported. Her doctor is a rheumatologist who deals a lot with the immune system. She did have a stuffed nose before the vaccine for several months now. Adverse event did not lead to visit to Emergency Room, Physician Office. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Each day it got a tiny bit worse, I was soo sick but lethargic and unwell. It got a tiny bit worse the next day but I am hoarse and my throat feels annoyed and I don&#39;t feel like me. Even though all this happened I would go through with it again. The injection site hurt the next day and it went away.

                                                The patient received her 1st Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine then within approximately 10 minutes she started complaining of shortness of breath and stated she &#34;needed oxygen for my heart failure&#34;.  I then directed her son to wheel her back to a room and the charge nurse grabbed the Oxygen for us.  We took a pulse on room air and she was bouncing around 84-85%.    At this point she began to have uncontrolled jerking movements in her neck, upper and lower extremities.  She was talking during these and never lost consciousness.  When the shaking started I had the nurse call 911 to get EMS on the way.    She then had her O2 by nasal canula placed and it was turned up to 6L to start until O2 came up to 98%.  We then slowly turned town to 3L and maintained SpO2 around 97%.  Involuntary muscle jerking continued although it was a little less severe.  EMS came and transferred her to the ER.

She did not see her doctor or go to the ED. She checked her glucose yesterday and it was high. She said she thinks her symptoms were from not eating her normal meals around the time of the vaccine.

Concomitant medication included oxycodone hydrochloride, paracetamol (PERCOCET [OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE;PARACETAMOL]) for pain in her right leg. The patient had severe pain in her right leg and she was going to pain clinic for that, he was giving &#39;Propacet&#39; for that. Caller stated that she had the injection on Monday (18Jan2021) at fair grounds, its the Covid Vaccine. She didn&#39;t feel good the day she got it on Monday. Then Tuesday she felt good. Wednesday (20Jan2021) she was sick again, and having pains in the stomach, well she can&#39;t say stomach, but also towards the afternoon around 2&#39;o clock, she got light headed and dizzy, she felt like she was about to pass out (21Jan2021), and she thought to herself she had to hurry and get something to eat and that feeling last 4-5 hours. She took a pain pill when she got something to eat, and thought to sit down watch a program to take her mind off of it because she felt like she was going to die (Jan2021). After the pain pill and the food it seemed to get better. She wakes up in the night crying (Jan2021), because she was scared if she didn&#39;t get better the shot would kill her. Maybe it&#39;s her nerves getting the best of her. Her son had the vaccine and had no side effects. She wanted to know if she is the only one having the side effects. While on the phone with this call handler, caller states that she was starting to get dizzy again but she just had breakfast. Her First Dose was on 18Jan2021 Mon, and on the way home she said to her son she was getting dizzy/ lightheadedness. Her son said to her its not from the shot, but she was getting dizzy.

On 21Jan2021 Thursday she felt dizzy, like she was going to pass out. On 22Jan2021 Friday she was feeling dizzy again, and her stomach was acting up and she was weak again. Caller was dizzy and weak. The dizziness was a different each time, sometimes she has got it, sometimes she didn&#39;t, its intermittent, she would be doing something and then she needed to grab a hold of something when the dizziness come on. Her Weakness was about the same.  She was not feeling the stomach pain right at this minute, when she woke up during the night with it and last felt it 5 or 6AM this morning, she had chores and tasks to do this morning, but her heads going at that time also around 5 or 6 o clock, it was about the same as Wednesday, she just felt like she needed to get something to settle her stomach down, like she needed something for the energy. When attempting to get the product details, caller states that she was getting old, she provided EL3248, she needed light to read it. The card did have an Expiry date but she can&#39;t read it, it&#39;s 20 something, she just can&#39;t read. She was on nothing new. She took a pain pill when she got home but it didn&#39;t help, she was still dizzy. The pain pill was Percocet, it was dispensed in a brown pharmacy vial. Medical Conditions: She has a leg problem, it&#39;s severe pain in the right leg in the back, she wears a back brace, she needed an MRI Monday. Caller stated the date 12Feb2021, but did not confirm what this date was for. She didn&#39;t know how she would get the MRI if she didn&#39;t feel better. They were trying to pinpoint the pain in the leg. They tell her that she was in good health for 87 years of age, when they put her in back brace she felt good. On Monday when she got up there she was a little weak and they put her in a wheelchair that day, this past Monday. She had No results to share but she had a X ray a couple weeks ago (Jan2021), and that would lead up to MRI she was going to have. Caller stated that she had very bad nerves, her husband passed away 2 years ago and she hasn&#39;t overcome that, she lived by her-self, and was wondering if some of this stress, would lead to the symptoms she was having right now. She wanted to know if these are normal side effects and if it safe to have the second dose. Caller stated that she was slow and old. Consumer further stated, she didn&#39;t know if she got the right party or not. She just want to know if she was having a reaction to the COVID-19 injection (COVID-19 Vaccine) that she had on Monday, she didn&#39;t have a (distorted voice) that serious, like the whole Monday she was sick, Tuesday she felt fine, yesterday she was so stressed she can&#39;t hold her head up today she felt good but about 2 o&#39;clock, she had pain in her stomach and she had it all the time, the pain in her stomach was like she had an ulcer and all of sudden she feel like she was little warm (Jan2021) and had to pass out and then get something to eat and sit down and take something for pain and it last about two hours and then go away and about 4 hours later she got it right back.

A 87-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 18Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication reported as unspecified (Caller states that she does take a few medications but nothing has changed with those in years, so she does not think anything else is relevant). Historical vaccine include flu shot and does have reactions. Caller stated she received Pfizer COVID shot first dose and within an hour she had migraine without the headache but did have the vision blocked out. It resolved after some time. she wanted to know the ingredient of the vaccine to see if she should take the second dose. Caller states that she had her first Pfizer COVID Shot on 18Jan2021. Caller states that she didn&#39;t have any of the ordinary reactions, both the caller and her husband had the shot and neither of them got a sore arm or swelling at the site. Caller states that after they stayed for a half an hour, and when they were driving back to, the caller started to get a migraine aura. Caller states that she has had them before, but not often, and she has not had one for about 10 years. So caller states that her aura started while they were driving, and then the caller&#39;s husband dropped the caller off at the grocery store. After being dropped off, caller states that her migraine came on strong. Caller states that her migraine was strong enough that she could not see, she was experiencing flashing lights, and blocked vision. Caller finally turned to another customer to ask if he could see the cucumbers in front of them. Caller states that she waited outside for her husband to get her. Caller states that migraine probably lasted for about 45 minutes. Caller is wondering if this could have been from the shot or not. Caller states that she does have reactions to flu shots sometimes, but not like this. Outcome of the events was recovered on 18Jan2021.

                                                Mom became so weak that she couldn&#39;t stand or walk without falling down. She seemed unable to control her legs and feet and was unable to sit up unassisted. She was admitted to the hospital on February 11, about 36 hours after receiving the vaccine. She had elevated levels of troponin, but all other cardiac tests came back normal. She had no other abnormal test results. Today, February 13, is the first day she has been able to walk a few steps and sit up without assistance.

I didn&#39;t think it could be related to the vaccine as it was so soon, and only in the one place.  It had lasted until now and I&#39;ve had three physical therapy visits so far, though it is not as bad, but it&#39;s over three weeks.  I didn&#39;t think it could be related until my doctor&#39;s office said they had four cases of the exact same thing, and in younger people. (20&#39;s and 30&#39;s).  At first, the PT said it was due to a pulled muscle, though I had done nothing at all to account for that.

                                                Patient received the injection on May 2nd.  Following the injection, we noticed an increased weakness and general achiness.  On the  8th she was so weak that we purchased a gait belt to assist her.  We were not super concerned as we were expecting the second shot to cause body aches or flu like symptoms based on what we had heard from others who had received both vaccine shots.  She continued to be unsteady and we found that she has a mild UTI which we had begun treating with prescribed antibiotics. Late afternoon on the 11th, mother suffered a major stroke.  we did not take her to the hospital because we had already been told that they would not be able to do anything at her age should she suffer a stroke.  On the 12th I called the doctors office and asked for them to send Hospice to the house as we could tell that she was dying.  Mother died on the 13th.    Just a week prior to her death I had spoken with Dr. and we had discussed how that she was declining in health but that she was not even close to needing Hospice, yet she is dead a week later.  Less than 2 weeks after getting her second Covid Shot.

                                                2nd COVID vaccine on last Wednesday afternoon 3/24/21.  Started to experience pins and needles in her right hand since late Wednesday - the same arm that the injection was in.  Now she is noticing some blisters on her right hand, those she noticed today. The following day of the injection the pain was so severe to the right arm from the shoulder all the way down the arm unable to lift the arm or movement. Pain is improving today .  Still has the blisters to the hand.    Pain in right shoulder and across the back of her neck - all on the right side. Used Tylenol and Lidocream OTC - helped very temporarily.   Also had fatigue lasting about a day and a half.

On 24Feb2021 they called the doctor and told them that she had collapsed again, and he said to stop the cyclobenzaprine and changed tramadol dose to half strength. She started being shaky. On 26Feb2021 they called the doctor back because she had the same symptoms with the addition of vomiting. They said to stop the tramadol and start taking TYLENOL. On 27Feb2021 they went back to the urgent care for the same symptoms as well as leg pain, thigh pain, hip pain, being really shaky and real weak.

Two nights later the same thing happened on my right foot.  Several of my toes ended up with scabs on the tips of the toes.  My dermatologist told me that my toes had hemmouraged on the inside and the scabs were a result of that.  She had not seen anything like that.  I have  looked at all the images of Covid Toes on the internet and have not seen any with scabs on the tips of the toes.

She got the vaccine in her left arm, and it was her left arm that was sore. she had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Patient stated that after her hip replacement, she did experience a loss of feeling in her legs, and one time she even had a fall from it, like her legs did not hold her up. Patient stated that the fall occurred four days after starting a blood thinning medicine called Enoxaparin and once she stopped that medicine, she got to feeling better. she read somewhere that the COVID shot was given in the muscle, and that was why she thought the COVID shot might be related to her feeling like she was losing her muscles in her top half last night. The outcome of the event arm soreness, neck stiffness, left side of neck sore and muscles were being lost in the top of her, it stopped before got to legs was recovered and for other it was unknown.      Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 87-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 05Feb2021 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 15Jan2021 16:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity, Allergies to medications that contain dynacin; Allergic to Gabapentin; and has allergies to all antibiotics that end with &#39;cycline&#39;. Pertinent Details Include surgical procedures and dates: She was given doxycycline which made her pass out and lose complete control of muscles and everything and put her in the hospital for 3 days. The pharmacy gave her about 5 other medications that end with &#39;cycline&#39; and she was highly allergic to all of that so when she goes to the doctor she cannot take anything that has that in it. There were no concomitant medications. About a week after her second dose, she started having severe headache, pain in her legs, weakness, and fatigue. At one point, she collapsed because of weakness in her legs. Caller said they have gone to their HCP 6 times: 3 times with their urgent care doctor, 2 times with doctor, and 1 time in the emergency room. She wanted to know what to do with the adverse events. On 04Feb2021 she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and started on Cephalexin 7 day therapy as antibiotic and Phenazopyridine for pain with the UTI. On 14Feb2021 she saw her primary care doctor for severe headache. She was sent to the emergency room for the severe headache where she had a CAT scan in case she was having a brain bleed or stroke, but everything checked out just fine, they thought they were safe. On 16Feb2021 she was seen and had urine testing that showed the UTI she had had not cleared up, it had worsened. She was prescribed Ciprofloxacin 10 day antibiotic therapy for the UTI but only took Ciprofloxacin for 8.5 days because of all the side effects she was experiencing. On 22Feb2021 she saw her primary care physician for leg pain, weakness, fatigue and the same severe headache that she was seen for on 14Feb2021. On 22Feb2021 she was prescribed Cyclobenzaprine as a muscle relaxer and Tramadol as pain medication. Before she took any of the Cyclobenzaprine or Tramadol on the night of 22Feb2021 her legs collapsed on her. On 24Feb2021 they called the doctor and told them that she had collapsed again and he said to stop the Cyclobenzaprine and changed Tramadol dose to half strength. She started being shaky. On 26Feb2021 they called the doctor back because she had the same symptoms with the addition of vomiting. They said to stop the Tramadol and start taking Tylenol. On 27Feb2021 they went back to the urgent care for the same symptoms as well as leg pain, thigh pain, hip pain, being real shaky and real weak. Each time they were seen by the doctor or at urgent care they drew blood and said everything was ok. On 02Mar2021 they started thinking maybe it&#39;s the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She called to ask if these events are side effects of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Her bloodwork was fine, her urine tests since after 16Feb2021 are fine, the CAT scan showed her head is fine; but she still has severe weakness; she was walking with a cane now and before she was very active.

                                                Patient was out of breath after walking down to clinic from her room. She said she just needed to catch her breath and was given a few minutes to sit prior to vaccination. Pharmacist asked her if she felt okay today, which she replied yes. She stated the nurse assisting her down the hall was walking to fast for her. After her vaccination patient remained seated for 20 minutes and still reported shortness of breath. A pulse ox was placed on her finger and her pulse was ranging between 44-80 and O2 range was 94-98. When her pulse rate would drop, she had uncontrollable body tremors. EMS was dispatched within an hour after vaccination and patient was transported to the ED.

                                                Dizziness; Pain in the lower extremities; pain in feet; legs hurt; Felt poorly; Blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly; Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s sister). An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 07:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, bypass in 2010, hearing is very bad on the phone, arthritis pain, headache, and blood thinner. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included metoprolol for hypertension, quinapril for hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) for hypertension, ascorbic acid/ calcium/ minerals NOS/ retinol/ tocopheryl acetate/ vitamin B NOS/ vitamins NOS/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER), calcium carbonate (CALTRATE), atorvastatin, warfarin as blood thinner, spironolactone, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) for arthritis pain and headache; all were ongoing. The patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and had reactions to the vaccine or something else. That day, the patient&#39;s left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain), but that was expected, and it went away within 2 days (initially didn&#39;t report it because it was expected). Yesterday (18Jan2021), the patient experienced dizziness and pain in the lower extremities. Last night (18Jan2021; about 6 days after the injection), the patient woke up, felt poorly, and was very dizzy (feeling of dizziness), then, later on, had pain in both lower extremities. The patient took her blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly with result of 159. The patient&#39;s heart rate, temperature, and pulse oximetry were okay on 18Jan2021. She then walked to the bathroom, came back, and went back into bed. The second time she said her legs hurt but this morning she is feeling better than she was. Today (19Jan2021), the pain in feet is better, and the dizziness is gone. Pulse oximetry and temperature were okay this morning (19Jan2021). The patient was wondering if these effects could be related to the vaccine, since the dose was received 6 days ago. The patient was not sure if could possibly be related to the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was that she spent a lot of time doing paperwork on the computer yesterday (18Jan2021) and perhaps that caused some of the symptoms. The patient&#39;s sister called to ask if Pfizer has heard of any late adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccine like this patient&#39;s, 6 days later. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 04Feb2021 (day 22) and her sister asked what if it&#39;s not available. The patient&#39;s sister was concerned about interval and potentially being unable to gain access to the second dose due to supply issues. The patient recovered from &#34;Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain)&#34; on 15Jan2021; and from &#34;Dizziness&#34; on 19Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the other events.

Hospital could not determine cause and she was released into nursing facility on the 28th.  Did not recover.  Received her second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine at nursing home on Feb 4th.   Starting having symptoms of slurred speech and became more weak.  Labs on Feb 6th indicated very low hemaglobin levels and was admitted to the hospital on Feb 6th for transfusion.  She is requiring transfusions of blood and iron.  Possible ITP?

She finally got up and went into the bathroom and by 3:30 had coughed up little round, clear jellyfish.  Then she stopped coughing and went back to bed for 15 minutes, and then at 3:45 started getting diarrhea which she had until 10:30 AM.   She called Pfizer and reported her reaction and talked to them. During that time she had a lot of diarrhea and her body was starting to ache, joints and muscles.  She did not take her temperature and went back to bed, and slept until she could get up and go to the bathroom.  She then took her temperature and it was 100.7, which her normal is 97. 3.  She slept from 11:00 PM Wednesday until 11:00 AM Thursday.  She could not stay awake for long  before falling back to sleep.  Yesterday she did sleep most all of the day, and did not eat anything since Tuesday evening and did have a piece of toast yesterday.  Today, 3/19/21 she is able to get up, dressed and gotten downstairs to get something to eat and has lost 6# in this time period.  She is feeling wimpy, and her temp is down to 97.3, her pulse ox is 98%, pulse in the 70s.  She&#39;s achy, and has rubbed on Aspercreme  and has taken Tylenol a couple of times.  She is still very weak, probably dehydrated and going to get something to eat as she has just gotten up.  She is foggy thinking, but feels that once she rests, eats and gets strength she will be fine.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EM9809) intramuscularly, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021 at 10:30 (at age of 88 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; gabapentin, via an unspecified route of administration from 08Feb2021 to 15Feb2021 at 100 mg, daily, then via an unspecified route of administration from 15Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 08Feb2022) to an unspecified date, at 200 mg, daily for feet burn. Medical history included hiatus hernia surgery from Nov2019, surgery from an unknown date, vomited after surgery for three nights/days, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cancer, feet burning, feet red, asthma and thyroid. Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), fluid pill, vitamin D, vitamin C, potassium, acid reflux pill before nighttime before supper, thyroid pill, singulair pill. The patient previously took Codeine and percocet [oxycodone hydrochloride;oxycodone terephthalate;paracetamol] and experienced allergies. Two years before in Nov2019 she had hiatus hernia surgery. Her stomach went into her chest. She was in rehab. She had to have the surgery done twice. She went from one hospital and then she went to another and it was taken care of there. When she went to rehab after her surgery, all she did was vomit day in and day out. Her current vomiting reminds her of this experience. They finally did take care of it. She came out of the hospital and was vomiting. She clarifies she had problems with vomiting for the last 6 months before this current experience. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s eating. They say it&#39;s acid and she has Gerd. She does try to get her exercises in. When she was in the hospital, they found she had cancer, which they are just watching for now. When querying what kind of cancer she has, the caller explains she didn&#39;t have them do a biopsy. She didn&#39;t want to go that far into it. She didn&#39;t want any extensive treatment. At first, they were keeping check of the cancer every 3 months. Now, she is going ever year. She last went in November. The patient experienced macular degeneration on an unspecified date, vomiting on 23Feb2021 at 17:30, temperature 99.2 on 25Feb2021 at 10:00, very tired on 23Feb2021, arm was sore couldn&#39;t lay on it on 23Feb2021. Patient had the first Covid vaccine Tuesday morning, clarified to 23Feb2021 at 10:30AM and around 5:30PM that night she started vomiting. She vomited all night long and all day Wednesday and Wednesday night, and this morning. So far, it had stopped. She was trying to hold water down, but she couldn&#39;t keep water down, the water would come up. She clarifies further she tried to take a sip but it kept coming up. She called her doctor who was a practitioner and she told her to drink ginger ale and maybe crackers. She told the doctor that her daughter sent her electrolytes and she was told that was fine to take. She tried toast this morning and she couldn&#39;t hold it down. She&#39;s been eating very slow, taking little bites at time and she had been holding it down. She did have temperature of 99.2 on 25Feb2021, but half hour or so before it was down to 96 now. She couldn&#39;t take medicine that she normally takes because she&#39;ll throw it up anyway. She tried to take a few of her pills but it didn&#39;t stay down, she threw them up. Around 9am, she took her thyroid and that stayed down. So far, that&#39;s doing good. She takes Advair for asthma and she took that, that&#39;s okay. She took her singulair pill. So far, the three of these medications have stayed down, and she took 2 Tylenol. Patient took Tylenol twice. She knows it was Extra strength, took 2 pills Tuesday night but it didn&#39;t stay down. She Took 4 Tylenol today, 2 pills this morning and 2 right before her CNA left at around 3pm. Caller mentions she can&#39;t see the dosage on her Tylenol bottle. She doesn&#39;t see the dose. She mentions she will get her magnifying glass to check it out. She&#39;s afraid because she had surgery a couple years before and she vomited after surgery for three nights/days, or whatever. Today (25Feb2021), when she spoke to her doctor she was advised to call Pfizer to let them know how the vaccine is affecting her. Right now, she feels pretty good, but she was very, very tired. She&#39;s going to lay down when she gets off the phone. She had a CNA with her today and she also spoke to the nurse practitioner. The last time she vomited was around 10am. When the CNA came in, she told the caller to call the doctor but she told the CNA she&#39;d be fine. However, the CNA urged the caller to call her doctor and let them know what was going on. Her second dose was scheduled for 16Mar2021. Her doctor told her don&#39;t drink the water, drink the ginger ale and don&#39;t drink it too fast, and try crackers and toast. The patient took her temperature last night (24Feb2021) but couldn&#39;t read it that great, she thought it was 98. When the CNA came this morning (25Feb2021), she took it around 10:00AM and it was 99.2. She told the CNA to take another temperature because she didn&#39;t think she had a fever. When the CNA left, she had to leave at 3:00PM, her temperature was normal, it was 96. She thinks maybe her temperature went to 99.2 because she was drinking her tea. However, she wasn&#39;t drinking it right away, because she threw up on it. She stopped drinking an hour before her temperature was taken. She clarifies wasn&#39;t drinking the tea when the CNA came. She also mentions she broke up her the toast into little tiny pieces and felt like she was eating like a bird, but it didn&#39;t stay down so she stopped. The CNA came around 9am, maybe 8am, and clarifies it was maybe around 1030AM when she took the temperature. When the CNA left her temperature was at 96. The patient was very tired the same day she received the vaccine. She remembers went to bed with clothes on. Last night, she wanted to go to bed again with her clothes on but she couldn&#39;t stand it and she changed into her pajamas. Then, she went to the bathroom and vomited, she has a bucket by the side of her bed. It wasn&#39;t the dry heaves, stuff was coming up. She was still very tired currently. She makes the comment &#34;I forget things and then I remember afterwards&#34;. She had to get under the light to see the Covid card, it&#39;s small, it is handwritten. Caller mentions she sees the month on it. Caller reports her arm bothered her for quite a while. Last night, she went to sleep on her left side and her arm was feeling better which gave her some hope.  Her arm started hurting her the day she got the vaccine, but her arm wasn&#39;t red or anything. Her arm was feeling better this morning. She thinks if she can sleep on it and didn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s getting better. The last pills she took were Gabapentin she has been on for about 2 weeks. She explains her feet burn during the night and the doctor recommended the Gabapentin for now. However, she has had too much time trying to stop the vomiting that that took over her feet burning, so her feet didn&#39;t bother her as much. She was initially prescribed 1 pill at night before going to bed at 10pm, then when the 1 pill didn&#39;t work for a week, the doctor increased it to 2 pills at bed time at 10pm because it takes an hour to work. She stated that she was going to take the Gabapentin on Tuesday night, which was a mistake because she threw it right up and it tasted awful. Caller makes the comment she has not given the doctor the report of how that reacted yet. When probed for an NDC, Lot number or expiry date for the Gabapentin, the caller explains she can&#39;t see writing, it&#39;s in small print. She does see the Discard After: 08Feb2022. She needs to get her magnifying glass, she states she&#39;s going blind. She&#39;s been told she had macular degeneration. She doesn&#39;t think the Gabapentin is agreeing with her. She reads that it &#34;May cause drowsiness, operating vehicle which she doesn&#39;t drive, may cause dizziness, may cause vision.

A 88-Years-old white female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9266, expiration date: 31 May 2021), via intramuscularly in left arm on 14Feb2021 at a dose of 0.3ml as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s history included allergies to Penicillin, Cortisone, and she thinks also to Lidocaine, maybe. The patient did not have any NDC numbers, Lot numbers or expiry to provide for any of these products, as it was years ago. The patient did not receive any other medications. On 14Feb2021 about an hour after she got her vaccine; the patient had waited 40 minutes after getting the vaccine shot, and nothing happened, so she left, and while she was on her way home, she got a sensation in her nose, throat and upper chest like it was warm, and there was dryness. The patient previously used to get allergy shots because she was allergic to horse flies, and within 24 hours of being bitten, she would have hives the size of dinner plates. The patient went through allergy shots for 10 years and then she moved away and was no longer near water, so she did not think she needed the shots anymore. The patient had been getting the shots for 10 years, she would start to get where her lips felt funny and stuff after getting the shot, and her reaction to the COVID vaccine, felt similar to that, but it had dissipated within a half hour. This was probably respiratory and was not major, her nose did not close up, but it did get dry. The event resolved within an hour. The patient inquired with three physicians about if she should get the COVID vaccine, because she had an anaphylactic experience 40 years ago, before she was going to the allergist, and she had to go to the ER (emergency room), and they gave her whatever they did, Epinephrine or whatever it was, but that experience felt like she was being blown up like a straw was in her body. The patient inquired with these different physicians about told them about her experience from years ago, and what their suggestion would be, and they told the patient to go for it with getting the COVID vaccine, because it anything were to happen, it would be within 15 minutes of getting the shot, but the patient&#39;s was more than 15 minutes after getting it. The patient got the hives to the horse flies, it was usually within 24 hours. The patient did take an EPIPen with her when she went to get the COVID vaccine, because she was concerned she would have a reaction, but did not end up needing to use it. The outcome of the events was recovered.

The fatigue is their primary concern, as this is so profound she will fall asleep on the toilet or even in the middle of getting dressed.  Appetite is decreased, but she denies N/V/D.  She feels &#34;chilled&#34;, but no known fevers, no rigors/sweats.  Cough is occasionally productive of sputum, mostly clear but sometimes with small &#34;chunks&#34;; no hemoptysis.  No LE edema.  No HA or changes in taste/smell.  No known sick contacts, but patient has exposure to multiple daughters who help care for her, and she has been attending church recently.  Urine is dark/strong, but she denies dysuria.   Pt has received both doses of COVID-19 vaccine, second dose on 3/17/21.   Hospital Course:    Patient was admitted to medical floor for COVID-19 infection and urinary tract infection.  Patient had a very mild course of illness.  Decadron was started but patient did not require any remdesivir.  Patient has remained at her seen home oxygen requirement.  Patient was seen by PT and OT services for generalized weakness.  Blood cultures have been negative.  Patient is medically stable for discharge home today.  She will need another 2 days of antibiotics treatment for urinary tract infection.  Since her respiratory status has been very stable, we have chosen to discontinue the use of Decadron upon discharge to avoid any changes in mental status induced by steroids in an elderly patient.  Home health services and remote monitoring kit have been ordered at the time of discharge.   I have called patient&#39;s daughter  to provide update that patient is coming home today and answered her questions

An 88-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Mar2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation (reason: giving them and because she had bone marrow disease and doctor thought she should get it) at doctor office. Medical history included 2 aortic valve replacements (last one was replaced 3 years ago in May and the first one was replaced 5 years ago), ongoing autoimmune disease and ongoing acid reflux, bone marrow disease and Covid. Concomitant medication(s) included prednisone (5mg once a day by mouth; she had been taking it for a number of years for a condition auto immune disease and she has to take it for the rest of her life) taken for autoimmune disorder, and pantoprazole (40mg once a day by mouth; started probably 5years ago) taken for acid reflux, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (Lot: EM9809) as dose 1, single on 12Feb2021 for covid-19 immunisation; flu vaccine for asthma (when she got a flu shot years ago, she had to go to ER for an asthma attack from that; it was way back in the 1990s; NDC, Lot, Expiration: Unknown). No investigation assessment was done. No vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Family medical history relevant to adverse event was none. The patient experienced sickness on 05Mar2021; fever chills on an unspecified date, sinuses and nose plugged up; diarrhea and upset stomach; stomach hurting; no appetite on 08Mar2021; sweating and felt hot; and skin and eyes burning and itching/her whole body is hot and itching; and couldn&#39;t sleep on 12Mar2021; hives at injection site/hives all over on 14Mar2021, hurts to breathe on 15Mar2021; cough on 17Mar2021; tiredness; joint pain on 21Mar2021; muscle soreness on 22Mar2021, weakness on 23Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of this with BENADRYL, Z PACK, MYLANTA AND TYLENOL. Clinical course was as follow: The patient stated that she wondered if should&#39;ve even had the vaccine. The patient had Covid in Mar2020 (a year ago in March) and she had long haulers until Jan2021. In March, her hematologist called and said she could get vaccine and stated that she shouldn&#39;t have. She stated that the second one made her really sick. This sickness was getting too long. Her second dose of the vaccine was on 05Mar2021. She was so tired; stated she doesn&#39;t feel good. She stated that she felt like she has long haulers all over again, it was horrible. Stated she felt like she shouldn&#39;t have gotten the second one. States she was doing okay with first one. Caller states that she already gave up a whole year of her life because of this. She tried to call before, but she didn&#39;t wait to talk to someone, she had to go somewhere. The patient stated that she had hives, tiredness, problems with her intestines, got really sick, her skin and eyes started to burn, she felt like she had hives all over, her skin was burning, she was sweating and felt hot, stated on the 14th it really got bad, her whole body was hot and itching. States that she took a BENADRYL and felt better the next 2 days and then started getting sinuses and nose plugged up and it hurt when she was breathing, had a slight fever, and her skin was itchy. She states that she went to doctor on 15Mar2021 (physician office visit), and he didn&#39;t think too much of it because her oxygen was okay. States that she felt worse, she was coughing bad, felt terrible, her muscles ache, and when she was hot, she couldn&#39;t sleep, now all she wanted to do was sleep and she had fever and chills. She was supposed to do exercises, but she couldn&#39;t, and it started two days ago. States she was not coughing as much but it was still hard and hurting. It was some of her joints, not all of her joints were hurting like when she had long haulers. Fever and chills started when her sinuses started acting up. The fever and chills kept getting occasional slips in and out. Her fever was not high but enough to get the chills. Sinuses and nose plugged up: it came and went with MUCINEX and it helped a little. Her intestinal problems were diarrhea that started on 08Mar2021 and upset stomach. She had a problem and it hurt terrible for days after. No appetite lasted for one week, so probably ended 15Mar2021. Caller states that she felt a little better but can&#39;t get rid of her cough. Couldn&#39;t Sleep: started when she had the burning and lasted a little after because she had to get herself together again. She could only sleep three hours at time. Skin and Eyes Burning and Itching: The burning and itching went away for a while, but it was back again because she had been lying in bed and tired, stated that it was not so bad. The burning stopped 15Mar2021 when the hives were gone, but she stated that right now it was back, her skin gets hot and then starts burning and itching. Patient stated that she did not have too much problems with first but this second, oh my god. She thought she got it too soon after having long haulers. She got rid of that in Jan2021 and was feeling good but now she felt terrible again. States there were no tests, she didn&#39;t have any. She was so weak, and she was having a hard time now, and she was doing so good. She was worried about her heart and valves. She guessed that call handler couldn&#39;t help her either, she stated that she didn&#39;t know what to do to feel better. She thought she had better call and report it. She has already gone to doctor and had only gone to him for 2 years, but hopefully he knew enough about her. She states that she probably should call him because she wasn&#39;t getting any better. The outcome for hives at injection site/hives all over was recovered on 15Mar2021, skin and eyes burning and itching/her whole body is hot and itching was not recovered, muscle soreness was not recovered, weakness was not recovered, cough was not recovered, tiredness was not recovered, joint pain was not recovered, fever chills was not recovered, sinuses and nose plugged up was unknown, diarrhea and upset stomach; stomach hurting was recovered on 11Mar2021, hurts to breathe was recovering , couldn&#39;t sleep was unknown, no appetite was recovered on 15Mar2021, sickness was unknown, sweating and felt hot was not recovered , sinuses and nose plugged up was unknown, skin and eyes burning and itching was not recovered, sweating and felt hot was not recovered.

Taken to ED and evaluated for acute stroke, TPA given. CT was not definitive. Weakness was R&gt;L. Pt confusion worsened a bit into evening of day of event, but by the following morning pt had returned to baseline. Is an independent 89 yo who otherwise lives at home alone and is highly functioning.  Pt did have a recent kyphoploasty and SI joint injection (perhaps with steroids/lidocaine).  Currently patient hospitalized, expected discharge soon, only complaint is tingling in fingers.... we believe this may have been coincidental, but due to time course are reporting here.

                                                The next morning after receiving the vaccine I noticed that my mother she talking to me, as her primary giver she knows me and comfortable to me. She tells me the same story over the over with isn&#39;t abnormal. It was every 3-4 words she was jumbling her words. I didn&#39;t think anything of it at first. I just let it go.   Early Wednesday morning  2:48am, I heard her in her bedroom. I went to check on her, I found at her dresser trying to put her watch on. She didn&#39;t know who was I or didn&#39;t know where she was. It took me about 40 minutes to calm her down. Now it was every 2 words that she was jumbling up. I finally got her back to bed. I went to send a message to her doctor. In the morning someone from the doctor&#39;s office called back I explained what was going on and they said get her to an ER.   I took her to the hospital 01/27/2021.  She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  Still not been discharged. Patient was still confused when I had to left last night, did not understand where she was at or why she had to stay there. My mother was very angry when she woke up early Wednesday is not my mom she is very lovely. One year or two years she did have a TA or mini stroke.

This 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number PFREL1283, Expiration Date 30Apr2021), via intramuscular, on 15Jan2021 (at 12:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing lymphoedema (she gets water in her legs), ongoing severe arthritis of both knee caps (she had a cortisone shot and lidocaine in her knees), and dust allergy. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine received in Jan2020 and in Oct2020 (with terrible reaction: pain in arm, numb in arm and muscle pain arm for 6 weeks). Past drug history included allergy to lidocaine (her face swelled up), and hydrocortisone (CORTISONE). She was in a wheelchair. Surgical history included 2 hip replacements. Relevant concomitant medications included drug for lymphoedema. The patient stated she started having side effects almost immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She felt very panicky, felt very weak, felt very tired. She had like a headache. Some of the symptoms started the day she got the shot and then more symptoms arose the day after. She was very tired and was sleeping a lot the next day. She felt very like groggy. In fact, she was so groggy, she pressed the wrong button in her chair. She clarified she has lymphedema and she has to be in a lift chair to keep her legs elevated. When she needs to get up, she presses a certain button to raise and lift the chair into a sitting position. However, that day, her doorbell rang (her meals are delivered to her) and she was so groggy and confused, that she pressed the button that put her straight out into a lying position instead of a sitting position. She ended up sliding off the chair and onto the floor. She had to call for assistance (there is an emergency button she can press). She had to be lifted off the floor. She explained to them she didn&#39;t end up on the floor from walking, she slid off the chair. She was so disoriented she pressed the wrong button. She felt like she had the flu, she was cold, she had the chills. She was laying down, covered up with 2 blankets. She couldn&#39;t move. It was terrible. At the time, she slid off the chair, she had to go the bathroom. She is on a water pill which makes things worse, but she has a bedside commode close to her lift chair. When she was trying to get off the chair go to the bathroom (which is only 4 or 5 steps away from the commode), she was so disoriented, she pressed the wrong button. She has had this chair for 5 years.  She slid off the chair and ended up hitting the floor with her rear end. She remained on the nice cold floor (its a ceramic tile floor) until they came to pick her up. She mentioned she has had 2 hip replacements and once she is on the floor, she can&#39;t get up. Once assistance from where she lives came to pick her up, she was asked if she need to go the hospital or call ambulance. She explained to them she didn&#39;t fall. She slid off the chair. She is a very active person. Although she is almost 90, year is not senile. She slid off the chair, she didn&#39;t fall. The patient stated that she got the flu shot this past October and had a terrible reaction to that, too. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her system. She has had a flu shot every single year for the past 10-15 years and she has never had a reaction at all. She received the regular flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office in Oct2020 had a terrible reaction, she had severe pain in her arm where they gave her the shot, the pain wasn&#39;t at the injection site, the shot was high up the arm, her arm was numb and she couldn&#39;t raise it; she had muscle problems with the arm, she had trouble with her arm for 6 weeks. She has been taking naproxen sodium (ALEVE) for the headache. She has just been treating it symptomatically. No fever and she has just felt cold. The patient stated she really is not sick. She went to pick up dog medicine from the vet and when she leaves her facility, her temperature is always checked when she comes back. She was told her temperature was 97 something. So, she wasn&#39;t running any temperature prior to the vaccine. The patient was planned for the second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient stated her symptoms are not so severe it affects her breathing or something serious. It&#39;s just a pain in her neck to walk around with a headache. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I suffer from neuropathic pain  in both my feet at night in bed. It is alleviated  by Voltaren or Icy Hot spray. This exaggerated pain in my feet had me up the entire night and nothing relieved it. I had to walk around and try to ease the pain  but nothing gave me any relief. At 6am I took 2 1/2 gr of Valium and finally fell asleep for 3 hours. I was much better in the morning.

He called 911 and the firemen helped me sit up.  I was cold and clammy, but could talk and answer all questions.  The firemen said I should be all right and they left.  They said they had had extra calls for the same symptoms.  I went to bed, and my blood pressure was 93/53.  I slept all right.  The next day, yesterday, I was tired but feeling all right with the highest temp of 98.4.  Today, February 25, I am doing better.  I called and left a message for Dr.

                                                right arm is sore; Fever; tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient).  An 89-year-old female patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Batch/lot # EM9809, Exp date 30Jun2021) intramuscular at single dose in right upper arm on 11Feb2021 16:24 for Covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ongoing arthritis both diagnosed about 5 or 6 years before, covid-19 and pneumonia in Nov2020 and she was in the hospital from 04Nov2020 to 09Nov2020, she was hard of hearing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks), aside the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot: EL9261, Exp date 31May2021) intramuscular at single dose in right upper arm on 21Jan2021 16:24 for Covid-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No events occurred following prior vaccinations. The patient experienced right arm is sore, fever, tired on 12Feb2021. The events were considered medically significant. No event required a visit to Emergency Room or physician. No relevant test done. Course of events as follows: Her arm was sore. Sore arm started on 12Feb2021 morning. She has arthritis and stated maybe this had something to with the soreness in upper right arm, near shoulder, where the vaccine was administered about an inch below her shoulder. Soreness was just there, it hurt. She was very tired and running a temperature of 100.4. She noticed the fever when she got up on 12Feb2021 morning, it was only 99.3 or 99 something, in afternoon it was 100.4. She did not like the fever. She took of paracetamol (TYLENOL 500mg, Lot: 9HV1619, Expiration date May2021) 1000mg twice and it did not really take her fever down. The outcome of events was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that the events right arm is sore, fever, tired were related to the BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, a acausal relationship between events right arm is sore, fever and tiredness and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded.

An 89-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 04Feb2021 at 89-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included macular degeneration from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249; left arm) for COVID-19 immunization on an unknown date.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: shivering (non-serious) on 10Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, tiredness (non-serious) on 10Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, fever (non-serious) on 10Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, shrunk a little bit (non-serious) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, really hot (non-serious) on 10Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: highest her temperature got was 100 on an unspecified date. About six days after the patient had her second COVID shot, the patient experienced shivering and tiredness. It was reported that the patient had shrunk a little bit starting on an unspecified date.  At the time of the report, over the last 3 days, the patient experienced the side effects. &#34;It could be from something else. She could have gotten something. She did not know.&#34; The patient also had a fever a few times. The patient would go between shivering and really hot so she would take her temperature. The patient did not normally have a fever. When the shivering came on, she was trying to cook, and could not hold the spoon in her hand. The patient did not know what was wrong, but she was cold. All she wanted to do was sleep. The only symptom she still had was being tired. The night before the report, the patient woke up so warm and was sweating; her pajamas were damp. The patient could not sleep in them, so she had to go change. The patient has not shivered since then. The tiredness was persisting. The patient slept on and off all day today, but she was feeling better in general. The patient took her temperature every day. &#34;The highest her temperature got was 100.&#34;
