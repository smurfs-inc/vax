Swelling of the right side of my face started within a few hours later.  Called Drs. , He recommended taking Tylenol.  (Second Day) Next day, felt short of breath, weak, applied ice packs to my face. Third day, felt weak.  By the fourth day, swelling and itching subsided; but skin on my face felt gritty under the skin. Drove me to the doctor&#39;s office the third day.  I was short of breath walking from the car to the door to the doctor&#39;s office.  I was wearing my mask.  I saw a PA; but, she didn&#39;t tell me much of anything.  I don&#39;t think she knew what to say.

                                                Took shot 1/20 and asked the RN if I should take it because I explained I just got over covid, I told her I wasn?t sure how long it was  on Dec 19 I was raking leaves and I thought I should do this because I started having runny nose. I didn?t feel well that afternoon sneezing because I thought it was nothing. As the week went on I started sneezing and coughing and stopped up nose. I always end up with sinus infection when I get a cold Dec 28 I went to the doctor at doctors care and they did a covid test before the doctor would see I tested positive.  I went home and rested, no energy, felt like I was hit by a train, couldn?t breathe, sneezed a lot and hardly coughed.  January 1, I called ambulance and went to hospital, I was sick the first week of January.  I didn?t know that you should wait 90 days to get the vaccine after you?ve had Covid.  After I got the vaccination the adverse reaction, I woke up during the night with my arm hurting bad and throbbing and a very large red circle appeared on my arm 2? in diameter. The next 3 days I felt like I had covid all over again, the 4th day I woke up and felt a little better and got out of bed and started making progress each day. Now I?m not good, but I?m ok.

Put on more clothes and sat by fireplace.  Took 2 Tyneol and ate banana.  Continued to shake all over for 10 mins.  Shaking so much could not hold phone.  Subsided.  Startrd again lasting for 10 mins.  Subsided and finished at 11:30  PM.  Stayed up until 1;00 PM.  To bed and had difficulty sleeping.  Feel alright today.

                                                Patient was observed for 15 minutes after the vaccination administration, felt fine, and left the facility with her husband.  The 2 of them drove 2 blocks away to a restaurant to eat.  Midway through her meal, she reported that she started to feel &#34;funny&#34; like she was &#34;drunk&#34; or something, and felt nausea and hot/sweaty.  Her husband got her in the vehicle and drove to the vaccination facility,  When he arrived, she was obtunded and &#34;out of it.&#34;  No respiratory distress, No noted rash, but some clamminess/diaphoresis.  She was initially examined by FNP and cursory limited neuro exam while patient was seated did not reveal any gross motor deficits.  FNP called 911 and staff called for me.  When I arrived, patient was groggy, but responsive.  She was A&amp;O x3 and in no distress. Pulse 54, strong and regular (normal rate for her per patient--on a Beta blocker).  BP 120/74.  O2 sat 97% on outdoor cold air.  Patient was able to move all extremities equally and with equal strength.  Lungs CTA, Heart regular no murmur, abdomen soft.  Patient complained of continued malaise/grogginess and nausea, no vomiting.  EMS arrived, checked glucose, which was &#34;normal&#34; (I didn&#39;t hear the result) and patient declined transport.  I discussed ER evaluation vs. continued monitoring by me.  Patient and husband requested monitoring.  Patient stayed in the vehicle with her husband, I gave the husband my phone number to call if any worsening.  I checked on her 5 minutes later, then 10 minutes after that.  By that time, her adult daughter had arrived.  We again discussed continue family monitoring  vs. ER.  The family wanted to take the patient home to monitor.  Patient stated &#34;If I could just go to bed, I think I will be fine.&#34;  I called to check on the patient at 6p.  She had rested well and was improved.  She still felt a bit groggy, but otherwise was feeling better.  I called to check on the patient 1/29 at noon.  At that point, husband stated that she was &#34;back to normal. Symptoms and signs appeared to be consistent with a vasovagal response.  I suspected symptoms may have been prolonged by her Beta blocker

Pain through out my body is not. I am often dizzy.

                                                Woke from sound sleep  at 4 am (approximately 14 hours after having the vaccine shot) -- chilled, and every part of body hurt. Went back to bed.  6 am still hurt everywhere, short of breath (oxygen concentration at 90 and sometimes below--thankfully I had oxygen as I sleep with it).  Running a temperature of 100., disoriented, heart rate at 115&#43; and I hurt everywhere.  8 am called Dr. &amp; left call-back.  1 pm tried Dr. again.  Told person on telephone and he told Nurse Practitioner.  They ordered nose spray because I mentioned I may have a sinus infection as my head hurt, my ears hurt.  I continued Tylenol every 6 hours on Friday and Saturday (all day).  I was able to get up and do a few things on Saturday.  Felt better on Sunday but still weak feeling.  Oxygen saturation back to 95-96 and heart rate under 100.

I could barely lift it. applied ice and pain lessened...Then other events followed...My left wrist became swollen and red. then a day later the severe pain was in my left arm and I could barely lift it.  I then had a swollen right foot.  Podiatrist gave me a shot of cortisone but continued to have the pain and swelling...Shoulder pain returned.   2nd vaccine was 02/03/2021...Feb 10...both hands were stiff and I couldn?t open them...Then the shoulder pain in my right arm returned .  This lasted 4 days...with the most severe pain.

When I got to my doctor my blood pressure was elevated, it was about 180/88. My blood pressure is never that high. It did go down before I left to 140/84. When we were walking in the elevator after leaving the appointment my gait was unsteady. I felt very weak. I also light headed, and dizzy.  It felt like the feeling of the sedation you have receive  before having surgery. When we made it home I couldn&#39;t even see straight.  This lasted about 2 hours. I feel much better today.

Staff was notified as they were talking with her that  her voice sounded a little funny and thick. She also started to cough on a regular interval.

She was also placed on the ECG showing sinus rhythm with O2 stats of 100 % and her blood pressure was 149/61, After the Benadryl, she stated she started to fell somewhat better. After about 10 minutes her tongue started to swell again and when she turned her head to speak to a staff member her airway shut off due to swelling.

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 26Jan2021 at 14:19 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no previous immunizations. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date. Medical history included allergic to penicillin, bladder infection, in the middle of her chest she had the pain cling through her back, and thyroid getting lazy and does not work. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid getting lazy and does not work, vitamins, and sulfa drugs for bladder infection. It was reported that after getting the first dose of the vaccine the patient noticed she had pustules across her back on an unspecified date. The patient stated she &#34;got this rash from the tips of fingers, even the palm of my hands and it starts right under the neck and goes across my breast, on my belly, on my back and both arms and is now halfway down my shin bone.&#34; On an unspecified date in Jan2021, she noticed this the afternoon of her vaccine around 7:00 when she saw two splotches on her stomach and it kept spreading. Sunday morning she went to Quick Care and yesterday went to her regular doctor. Her doctor gave her prednisone to take 10 mg 4 times a day, and hydroxyzine 10 mg for itching. In her throat she was getting hoarse on an unspecified date and was keeping a water bottle on her desk to keep hydrated. She stated she read on (website) that a rash can be a symptom of the vaccine. The caller asked, &#34;if the pustules burst will this cause anyone to get Covid 19? Is this a possible side effect of the vaccine? How long will this last? Is it okay to get my second shot with this reaction? Is there anything I should be taking to make it go away?&#34; It was further reported that patient received paperwork to call if there was any type of reaction. The patient mentioned she has a rash that was all over her body on 28Jan2021. It was on the top of her hands, in the palm of her hands, on her arms, back, under her breast, on her chest, on her stomach, on her bottom end, it was going down her legs and to her knees at this point. The patient initially stated she noticed the rash on Friday (29Jan2021), she later stated it was Thursday 28Jan2021 when the rash first started. She stated she first noticed splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist on an unspecified date in Jan2021. At first when looking at it she did not think too much about it. Later in the call she further clarified and stated it was possible she noticed these splotches the same day in the evening on the day she got the vaccine. She was not sure. If it was not the same day it was the next day. Friday (29Jan2021), she started to get as initially stated bumps, but later clarified rash under skin and it really proceeded from there. Additionally, it was reported that the rash continued to spread throughout her whole body. It was down to her shin now. Her whole upper body was horrible. She has some across her back. There are pustules on them like a pimple. It was like water in it ready to break. Sunday she went to a (clinic name) to get it looked at. She went Sunday 31Jan2021. She was given an intravenous (IV) and three needles were placed in it. She knows one was a steroid, she does not know what the other two were for, but she thinks one was probably for itching. The patient also confirmed she also experienced itching with the rash on 28Jan2021. It started the same day she noticed the rash. The patient stated it was like a full blown case now. The itching was with the rash on 28Jan2021. The itching and rash has continued to go down her body. It was on her buttocks now. It was hard to sit. It was in private up between her legs and stuff. Her body was almost 80 % full and covered with this stuff. She saw her regular doctor yesterday. The doctor at (clinic name) thought this reaction may have been an allergic reaction to a Sulfa drug she was taking for a bladder infection coincidentally at the same time, but she does not believe this was the case. Stated she had taken that sulfa drug before previously. She does not have the name of the drug to provide of the sulfa drug. She does not have it with her. No blood work was done. She was just looked at. They saw what was going on. The patient also mentioned she went on the internet to do research. She saw on Pfizer page three pictures that resembled what she had going on. It was also reported that the two splotches on right hand side started about 7&#39;clock in the evening. At first did not think anything of it. Thought it was possibly a bug bite at first. Additionally, it was reported that patient went to see a doctor. She was already going to the doctor for a bone density scan and she showed the doctor what was going on at the same time. Her primary doctor thought this was due to the COVID 19 Vaccine. At end of call, patient questioned &#34;if the pustules across upper back and behind neck, will that cause anyone to get COVID 19? Side effect?&#34; The patient had no emergency visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of itching with the rash, rash that is all over her body, and two splotches on right hand side. The patient had not yet recovered from rash that is all over her body while outcome of the events pustules, itching with the rash, in her throat she is getting hoarse, and &#34;splotches on her belly on her right side, right below her waist /Two splotches on right hand side&#34; was unknown.

                                                Terrible nightmare during night of injection.  Smothering and paralyzed feeling. Shouting out in my sleep.  Husband finally woke me .  When I got up to take a Motrin I was disorientated. Did not know where I was. .   Next day experienced several sudden feelings a syncopye.  Lasting a few seconds. Had to grab on to something due to a feeling that I was going to fall. It lasted just a quick second or two.  Happened several times that day.  Like what I would think a TIA would feel like.  Arm was just slightly tender and stinging the first day,.  In the night it was aching and hot up into my neck.  The next morning it was fine again. Just tender and a little stiff.  I attempted to report this on line at instructed on forms given me when I left the site. however the CODE that was to be sent to my phone never came. I then entered the wed site and attempted to report it there. .  Finally I called my primary Dr and he has instructed me to report this to the person giving the second injection.  I doubt they will know what to do seeing as they are volunteers with little experienc.e

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

Patient medical history included bladder infection, blood pressure, she has some old age stuff like blood pressure, and she had Thyroid removed and takes a thyroid pill every day and she tends toward GERD. Concomitant medications included she does take other medications, but they are not relevant. Patient previously took Shingles shot for Shingles (Had the first of the Shingles shot but it was before that. She is due for the second one but she is putting it off for the COVID second dose). Patient reported that she got the COVID vaccine and was really excited because seemingly, she had no side effects. The shot did not hurt. Ten days after she go the shot, she got really hot at night and really strong muscle and joint aches on 31Jan2021. She was up almost all night. It just kept waking her up. So, she took something, an Ibuprofen thing to reduce fever and pain. The next night she took one proactively and did not have pain. The third night, she had it again but it was a headache all night and she was hot on 02Feb2021. It only seemed to happen at night. She felt like it was from the vaccine. She was not worried she had COVID. She had no breathing problems and did not feel like she was going to pass out. They said she should wait 48 hours and take a test to see if she had COVID. She did and it was negative. She does not feel any negativity toward the vaccine. She went in for a bladder infection and it was from a doctor&#39;s appointment that she got information and they told her she could go ahead and get it. Since she got the vaccine, she got white bump in the vicinity of the vaccine like a while mole, and another in the vicinity of the area as well. It does not itch or hurt. She noticed it about a week after the shot. She does not know the date. She was still on medication for a bladder infection but it would not have done anything. When she had reaction to the vaccine, it was already 10 days after she got the shot. She had asked them at Kaiser, and they think it was unrelated to any other medication. Outcome of event fever was recovered on 01Feb2021, for white bump near injection site was not recovered and recovering for all other events.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I think I am having a bad reaction to my covid shots.  The first shot was 1/31; a week later on 2/7  I started having headaches that travel around my head: some are behind my eyes and my teeth ache;  some more like migraines that go up the back of my head; some more on the top of my head or on the side.  My sense of taste changed.  My second shot was 2/27.  The day after I slept all day.  The headaches continued (I have had a headache of one kind or another since 2/7).  I had a tooth that broke off last June and was removed on March 8.  I thought the tooth was infected and part of the headache problems, but since then I have been having really bad fibro pain and for the week of 3/8- 12 I ran a fever, had chills and more headaches.  I was on amoxicillin from 3/8 to 3/14, but the tooth was not that badly infected and is healing well.  The headaches do not seem to relate to the tooth.  I have had a headache every day since 2/7 of various intensity and in different areas of my head.  I am extremely fatigued and need to nap some days.  My fibromyalgia symptoms are worse than they ever have been and some nights keep me awake.  I also muscle stiffness and spasms in my neck occasionally.  This is not normal for me. I saw a ARNP on 3/16 and she tested me for neurologic symptoms. Here are her notes:  NEUROLOGIC: negative findings: speech normal, mental status intact, cranial nerves 2-12 intact, gait, including heel, toe, and tandem walking normal, Romberg negative, muscle tone normal, muscle strength normal, rapid alternating movements normal, finger to nose normal, reflexes normal and symmetric   I have a video appointment with my primary care provider 3/26 to discuss this further

                                                feeling cold throughout the day; sore area on her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL8982 and expiration date was not reported) intramuscularly on 02Feb2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was scheduled to receive the second dose on 23Feb2021. It was stated that she had heard rumors by word of mouth and blogs that the second shot is a real doozer. Some of the things she had heard were really disturbing and was hearing that a lot of elderly people had died from the second shot. On an unspecified date, patient was having a sore area on her arm and feeling cold throughout the day after receiving the first injection, and state that both of those side effects passed throughout the day. Patient asked how many people had died after receiving the second vaccine and probably doesn&#39;t have right up to the minute information about how many people were dying from this vaccine. Patient reported that she had friends that took the second dose and they all had chills, body aches, headache and fevers. Patient also asked If she don&#39;t take the second shot, or take it months later from now, and a new variant strain comes out, will she more susceptible to the new variant strain by not taking the second shot and being covered totally and stated Dr. (Name)came out and said if she don&#39;t take the second dose, she will be more susceptible to the variant strain attacking her and she could die from it. Patient wanted to know instead of taking her second vaccine next week, can she delay it and take it months from now and asked will the vaccine be effective. Patient wondered why there was no expiration date on her vaccine record card. She made the comment might be because it was so new, that&#39;s why there wasn&#39;t one. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Mar2021 13:50 (at 76-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. Medical history included hip replacement four years ago in 2017 (First right then 2 months later left) and knee replacement six years ago in 2015 (both 2 months apart). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6203), administered in Left Arm on 25Feb2021 (at 76-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced bad headaches. The patient received the second dose of vaccine on 17Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, she was not hurting and went to brunch with friends. Afterwards (on the same date, 29Mar2021), she was sitting and got the worst pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. She drove herself home but was in such misery. She went to the emergency room the next day, on 30Mar2021, wherein she had a CT (computerized tomography) scan that showed a blood clot in her lower abdominal area. She was taking pain medication every 6 hours, or she could hardly stand it. On 08Apr2021, she went back to the emergency room because she could hardly stand it. She was kept in observation status but was not admitted. She was scheduled to have another CT scan on 06May2021. She is not sure what they will do because the nerves are wrapped around it. She also mentioned that her doctor wants to do a biopsy. The pain was also running down to her ankle. She stated that she has had both of her hips replaced in the past. She added that her doctor will do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). He will put in a drain if it has not shrunk. The doctor can&#39;t do anything because the nerves are all tangled up (2021). As corrective treatment, the patient was taking pain medication for the blood clot and pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. Outcome of nerves are all tangled up was unknown, while outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after.

A few minutes later her lip from the center left was also tingling, and then spread to entire left side of her body from head to feet, like her left side feel asleep that tingly feeling and numbness.  Began to be worried, called 9-1-1 and the EMT reassured her that she was not having a stroke, and told her that they had heard of it before.  Still today, Monday 1/25/21, particularly in her left hand which she is not able to use very much.  Did take Ibuprofen but nothing else.

Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

                                                arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) received via a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies- there&#39;s a whole list of things she couldn&#39;t take; carried an epi pen for years. Concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) to avoid allergies. The patient had the 1st dose yesterday and she&#39;s feeling good. She had no side effects except for a little bit of arm soreness on Jan2021. Her doctor told her to take Tylenol for arm soreness, but another woman told me not to take Tylenol, but the patient didn&#39;t need it anyway (unknown if treatment was received). Her doctor was giving her Zyrtec to avoid allergies because there&#39;s a whole list of things she couldn&#39;t take and have carried an epi pen for years. She took Zyrtec before having the vaccine and would take another before the second dose. Would this make the vaccine less effective? Her appointment was 16Jan2021 and she have already scheduled for 08Feb2021. Do they give you a timetable? What was the timing of the 2nd dose of vaccine? The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

On 16Jan2021, she had a little bit of arm tenderness that lasted for 24-36 hours. Her arm was a little sore. The odd thing is that something took place when she got into bed on Sunday night 17Jan2021 which was 30 hours after the vaccine. Her head started to spin when she put her head down on the pillow. She was very dizzy. She was light headed/ foggy headed. That passed until she went to sit up and get out of bed. It happened again. It has been happening on and off for the last 3 days. She has checked her blood pressure because she is on a low dose blood pressure medicine. Her blood pressure was okay. Everything else seems to be normal. She gets that dizziness for a very short period of time. Her head is not a headache. It is so hard to explain. It is like a floaty heady feeling. She did have a little achiness in her arm. When she puts her head down, it is like woah this is strange. Her head feels like it is swimming. It is mostly when she gets in and out of bed. When she lays her head down and picks her head up. She provided that her height as 5&#39;1&#34; to 5&#39;1.5&#34;.  The event arm tenderness that lasted for 24-36 hours/ arm was a little sore/ little achiness in her arm recovered on 18Jan2021; outcome for all other events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) same reporter/drug, similar event,  different patient

Scary symptoms started in grocery store parking lot around 6PM (after vaccine at 8:35A) my legs felt like they were partially paralyzed and I would not be able to walk to the car.  I struggled to walk.  Got home and laid down.  Thought it was side effects to vaccine and it would pass if I went to sleep.  Woke up and felt totally paralyzed and it required a lot of effort to turn on my side to try to reach my phone.  All my muscles and joints ached.  I am never sick and not a complainer.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had anaphylactic shock in the past to a sulfur antibiotic. There were no concomitant medications. She stated she did not have an extreme reaction for the first 3-4 days, it was fine and went away. She had fatigue, joint pain, all the regular things and they were easing up. She had an appointment on the 20Jan2021 and thought things were going okay. On day 7, 20Jan2021, that night, she had an extreme reaction of blinding headache, the shakes, her whole body was shaking out of control for hours, her neck froze completely, and she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal (this is still occurring). The patient has had joint paint on 14Jan2021; extreme tiredness, weakness and muscle pain on 15Jan2021; chills, pain in her neck and muscles were so sore from 20Jan2021. She figured that was side effects, and she was handling, and then exactly a week after, she got the shakes so bad she shook for like 5 hours, she had to put nightguard in her mouth to stop from cracking, and severe headaches and her neck completely locked up, she couldn&#39;t move her head, and she still can&#39;t. She had extreme headache, and she went to the ER on 26Jan2021, since she was in really bad shape, they wouldn&#39;t believe her that it was a COVID reaction, she was there for 12 hours, they did every test, she had spinal taps, she had a head X-ray, everything, as they said she had meningitis, but then ruled that out, they wouldn&#39;t believe she was having a reaction to the COVID shot, she can&#39;t move her head, her joints and that are ok otherwise, but she can&#39;t move her head, she has pain in her neck, and she is taking Excedrin for that. She stated her doctor told her to go ahead and take the second dose of the vaccine and just take Tylenol after. She stated Tylenol has no effect whatsoever. If she takes Excedrin the headache will go away and Tylenol won&#39;t budge it. She stated she is taking Excedrin regardless of what the doctor says. When asked for age of onset, states she was on Valium and she was not thinking straight, and asked her husband her age. She was not sure why it was given, now provides name as Diazepam 5mg. Muscle pain is fine now, it went away. She went to the doctor on 20Jan2021, as she had a regular appointment for bloodwork to be done, and said she felt pretty good, she had some reaction but was fine, and that night is when she got shakes and shivers so bad, she had 3 quilts on and couldn&#39;t warm up, her body was out of control, she couldn&#39;t stop, now states for 3-4 hours. Severe headaches started the night of the 20Jan2021. Her neck pain started right after the shakes, so maybe she pulled muscles when she had the shakes, the muscles were so sore, and she couldn&#39;t move her head, like down or to the side, she couldn&#39;t move it, which is why she went to the hospital, to the ER. She was there for 12 hours. She started taking Excedrin, states she ignored what the doctor told her. She knows her body and she can take Tylenol and Ibuprofen like it is candy, and it does nothing, one Excedrin puts everything away, she swears by Excedrin. The outcome of the event shaking recovered on an unspecified date; Joint pain and Muscle pain recovered on 19Jan2021; Blinding headache/ severe headache, Fatigue/Extreme tiredness was recovering, chills/ shivers, couldn&#39;t warm up, Neck froze completely, pulled muscles, fatigue was unknown; she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal/ couldn&#39;t move her head, Pain in her neck, Muscles were so sore, Weakness was not recovered.

This morning she had swelling in her arms, real bumpy about 2 1/2&#34; in diameter, looks like rocks, red/pink area 1 1/2&#34;.  It is very painful throbbing area on her arms,  getting worse.   She has been taking Tylenol.  She felt a little relief of the pain with the Tylenol.  She rested all day yesterday.  She left at 10:00 for her bridge club and that&#39;s where she noticed the reaction and has gotten home around 3:00 and not feeling well.  They told her to call us as they did not have any side effects from the vaccine.   She does have an appointment on 3/11/21 with her PCP.

                                                Pain; Burning sensation; Hives; Injection site soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: el1284 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 19Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lymphoma from May2020, had chemotherapy for lymphoma from Jun2020 to 08Oct2020, shingles, knee replacement from 2008 and allergic to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she thinks she was having side effects from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine she got 19Jan2021, tomorrow 02Feb2020 was two weeks from when she got it. Patient didn&#39;t have any side effects to start with, just soreness to the injection site on Jan2021. She says last Wednesday, 27Jan2021, she noticed she had hives, not a rash, on her chest on the left side that are kind of on her breast, the top of her breast, which now spread under her arm up to her shoulder area and back. There was pain along with it, a burning sensation starting last night on 31Jan2021 in the inside area. Since she got her injection on her left side, she doesn&#39;t know if this could be a reaction to the injection or not. She had shingles several years ago, this was acting like that, and it looked like one of the side effects listed is lymphadenopathy, which she looked up information about that, but she doesn&#39;t know what it was, she doesn&#39;t know what else to blame it on. Patient hasn&#39;t seen her doctor yet for hives, and has not treated the hives. She got the OK from the nurse who said she didn&#39;t see a reason for her not to get the vaccine since she was coming off chemo several months prior. Patient was considered to be in remission right now, and she has an appointment next week with her oncologist for follow up. Outcome of the events was unknown.

She was observed for an hour, offered water and juice following the vaccine and was released home.

(injection given at 1452) The doctor suggested heat/cold, anti-inflammatory,  brace and finally an x-ray which indicated nothing.  Four days after the second injection I&#39;ve experienced mild pain in my opposite thigh and fatigue. The second injection was given in the opposite arm (left). While chatting with others  in recovery after second injection about knee pain, another woman said she was experiencing the same and thought it was her arthritis but it felt different.

                                                tiny sore in her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN5318, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at 16:00 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included back surgery on an unknow date and back pain from an unknown date.  Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) for back pain from back surgery. The patient reported that her doctor prescribed Tylenol to ease the back pain after a back surgery that she had before. She is prescribed to take the Tylenol 4 times a day at 6 hour intervals. She stated that she read something about after taking the COVID vaccine to not take Tylenol. At the time of the report she is feeling good with no side effects but based on the report she read that after, she is not supposed to take anything, she wanted to ask will it affect the effectivity as she read in a literature that Tylenol will decrease the efficacy of the COVID vaccine. She was wondering if it is ok for her to continue to take Tylenol. The patient also reported that she only had a tiny sore in her arm on an unspecified date in 2021. She was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The outcome of the event was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious.

                                                She can breathe better moving around but when she sits down, her breathing seems to be congested; Nose started stuffing up again; Her nose just swells; congestion in her chest; her arm was sore/ Little pain in her right leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265) solution for injection, intramuscular on right arm on 01Feb2021 at 09:10 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included breathing problems and COVID-19 on 31Oct2020 in which she waited exactly 90 days to get the vaccine. The patient had a small touch of pneumonia on her lower lobe of her right lung, she was on a lot of antibiotics and a strong herbal solution. She was on one antibiotic for 5 days and another for 7 days. She was on the herbal stuff for 7 days. She took all that stuff and was drinking lemon juice and hot water and breathing in lemon scent and Vicks Salve all in her nose. She also was prescribed an asthma pump. She had all that stuff going into her system. She also was tested, and she has H. Pylori bacteria. She explained her whole family must have that, it&#39;s hereditary. That wasn&#39;t her issue. However, all that she put in her stomach and in her system caused her to have stomach issues. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick. She told the person administering the vaccine that antibiotics made her sick and she was told it didn&#39;t matter and that this wouldn&#39;t interfere with the COVID-19 vaccine. Her stomach was all messed from all that stuff. The patient also has anxiety. She has never been treated with anxiety. She has had anxiety since she was a very young women and she has never been treated for it. When probed for any product information she had available for the medications that messed her stomach up and made her sick she provided the following information: The first medication she took was azithromycin (Z-PAK, lot number: KG0706, expiration date: Nov2021, NDC number: 0781-8089-26) that was dispensed in a little box. Dose was 250 mg which she took daily doses for 5 days. One of the doctors gave her a levofloxacin 50 mg for 7 days. She was given the pump, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL SULFATE HFA INHALATION AEROSOL, lot number: 102B4, expiration data: 20Jan2022) 90mcg per actuation. She explained she only took this once. She was so scared from this stuff. It squirted down her mouth. Another doctor prescribed her omeprazole 40 mg capsule every day because she told him her stomach was messed up. The patient was prescribed amoxicillin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet, by mouth three times daily for 14 days and clarithromycin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet by mouth twice daily for 14 days. The new doctor also had her taking omeprazole (the doctor wrote another prescription for this). However, this time the dose was 20 mg and she was prescribed to take that twice daily for 14 days. She didn&#39;t finish this medication. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick and the doctor explained because of her bacteria, she ordered the antibiotics to make her feel better. The patient told the doctor if she could live like this, let her not take these medications until she gets her stomach better and she would eat healthy food and find natural antibiotics at the health food store. She mentioned using oregano. She took that once a day. When she knew she was getting ready to take the COVID-19 vaccine, she stopped taking that 2 weeks before taking the vaccine. She stopped taking cholesterol medicine at night 2 weeks ago, it was making her sick to her stomach. She stopped her potassium medicine. She didn&#39;t want any of the medicines interfering with the vaccine. The patient also took an herbal medicine that was called a Spiritual, Mental, Emotional, Elevation Science of Eternal Life. It&#39;s a detox mixture that was very strong. She took this for 7 days. She had lost weight because she was not eating. The patient has always been a junk food eater. She quit eating junk food and that probably also had something to do with her being sick. She cooks all her food. There was no additional vaccine administered on the same date with COVID-vaccine. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She has never had a flu vaccine, pneumonia vaccine or shingles vaccine. This was her very first vaccine. Concomitant medication was reported as none. The patient didn&#39;t know if it was anything serious, but she tried to read all the information that was given to her. She was looking at the information and she saw &#34;if you have any difficulty breathing&#34;. That was the only one that she was having. She could breathe better moving around but when she sits down, her breathing seems to be congested. She was calling to see if this was anything serious and if she needed to go the emergency room. Since her breathing has been acting funny, she has been trying to keep moving around. She was cleaning her bathroom and the Bleach Cleaner and other cleaner opened her nose. She was listening to a town hall meeting and when she sat down to listen to it, her nose started stuffing up again. She has just been trying to get up and move around. Since she has been talking on the phone, her breathing was a little better. Her nose just swells. She got up and was beginning to eat breakfast when all of a sudden, the difficulty breathing started happening. It was around 8:45 am this morning (02Feb2021). It has improved, but when she would sit down, it would tighten up and she would have congestion in her chest. Since she has been moving around talking, it has gotten better. Sitting down has something to do with the difficulty breathing. She has had breathing problems before. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, 01Feb2021. She sat for half an hour afterwards and then came home. She then slept all night and stated her arm was sore on Feb2021, but it was feeling better. She also had a little pain in her right leg on the side she received her vaccine on Feb2021, which was currently gone. She wasn&#39;t sure if the breathing problems were from the vaccine or something else. The patient did not go to the emergency room or visited his physician in response to the events. She mentioned that if this continues, she probably will go to urgent care. The outcome of the event dyspnea at rest and respiratory tract congestion was recovering, recovered on Feb2021 for pain in extremity, and unknown for all other events.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EM9801), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 04Feb2021 (Administered between 9:30-10:00AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath. She said it was cold outside by her nephew&#39;s graveside, but she felt she had to fan herself like she was overheated. She said her heart rate was flying, and she had an irregular heart beat. She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell. She said she was tested the Friday before her nephew&#39;s funeral and was negative for the COVID-19 Virus. She said she has had a total of four COVID-19 Virus tests before, and all her COVID-19 Virus tests have been negative. She clarified she did not have a COVID-19 Virus test while she was at the ER on Saturday, 13Feb2021. With her nephew&#39;s death, getting her COVID-19 Vaccine had left her mind. She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital. She said she didn&#39;t even know that someone had drew blood from her. She said someone put a label on her, and told her the label was to show blood was drawn from her. She said when she looked down at the label, she saw an IV access was put in her arm. Additional treatment reported when she was in the Emergency Room, she was given an injection (clarified as IVPB on 13Feb2021) of Diltiazem 120mg at 12:13:50 PM, she said she was given another Diltiazem 5mg injection at the same time. She clarified she was diagnosed in the Emergency Room with Atrial Fibrillation. Patient stated that her blood pressure went up while she was in the Emergency room. She said she was kept in the Emergency Room so she could be monitored up until that evening. She said after the Diltiazem injections were given, her heart rate went down. She said the Emergency Room doctor gave her a prescription for Diltiazem 120mg white capsules, and told her to take the Diltiazem 120mg every day. She said the emergency room doctor told her she could go home, and that she needed to follow-up with her regular doctor. Reported she no longer has the shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or weakness. She said had felt a little tired at that time, as well. Patient also reported that on 22Feb2021 was her first day outside of her house since last Sunday (14Feb2021) and reported she has a slight headache, and her sight is not clear.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing low thyroid and mostly it&#39;s food allergies. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 125 ug, daily for low thyroid. The consumer stated, I took the vaccine on Monday (25Jan2021), three days ago and as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I came prepared because I do have some reactions sometimes. Mostly it&#39;s food allergies but I guess was being prepared, so I took Benadryl with me and I took it out of the packet. When probed for the treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I just took Benadryl as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I was prepared and I took my Benadryl with me and we stayed there I guess about 45 minutes until I felt better it would have been 12:15 and I was fine.&#34; The consumer stated, &#34;I have been trying for two days, that was in my arms hurting a little on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and then today (28Jan2021) around noon I was feeling a reaction again. I had the tightening in my neck and around my mouth area that&#39;s where I usually get the reactions from, but for two days I have been fine and I did not eat anything on an unspecified date in Jan2021 out of the way to give me a reaction to it. Now I took 2 Benadryl and it subsided but it&#39;s still tight around my neck and a little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness. What am I supposed to do? After I took this shot on Monday today is Thursday and I am having the same reactions that I had when I took (incomplete sentence) (pending clarification). The outcome of the events as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange was recovered on 25Jan2021, little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness and tightening in my neck and around my mouth area was not recovered and other events was unknown.

                                                weak feeling; heartbeat climb up and up; unnerving; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 77-year-old female patient received dose 2 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EN5318; expiration date 31May2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Concomitant medications included losartan, escitalopram, and atorvastatin from unknown dates for unspecified indications. The patient received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (lot number EL1284; left arm) on 15Jan2021 at 11:00. The patient previously received codeine on an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced allergy. On 06Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced a weak feeling and heartbeat climb up. The patient had a weak feeling, had to sit down and took her pulse with oximeter and her Apple watch. She watched her heartbeat climb up and up. She tried yoga breathing but could not slow it down. She was not sure how long this went on because it was very unnerving, but it reached as high as 105 before it started to go down. The beats went up, then down, finally started to keep going down. Once more there was a wave of the weakness through her before she stayed in the 73&#43; range. The patient was usually in the 60&#39;s. Since then the patient&#39;s heartbeats have been what is usual for her. During the episode the patient&#39;s husband found &#34;rapid heartbeat&#34; on the paper they received. The patient was concerned this happened a day after the vaccine, not within an hour. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient was not hospitalized and did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcomes of weak feeling and rapid heartbeat were recovered. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

After 12 hours the fever gradually subsided as did the pain in my neck and shoulder. Was left with headache that remained overnight but the pressure was not like the day before. Saturday I was just tired, I think from the fever, but by the evening I was back to normal.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on 20Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in right arm to prevent covid. Vaccination Facility Type was Health department. Medical history included rotator cuff challenge. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccine was administered on the same date. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events were following prior vaccinations. Patient was calling about Pfizer Covid vaccine. She had the first shot on 20Jan2021. She did not have a reaction. She went to go get her monthly massage on Saturday (23Jan2021). On Sunday morning (24Jan2021) she started to feel ill and she had to go the hospital. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital. She had chills, aches and pains, it felt like an elephant was on her chest, she had chest spasms, a fever a little shy of 101. She went to hospital and the doctor there told her she had covid since she had all the symptoms. She confirmed she did not have covid and had a negative covid test. She had chest x-ray and an EKG since she thought she was having a heart attack. Reported her massage was primarily on her left shoulder, it was a deep massage on that area since she had a rotator cuff challenge, massage was focused on that shoulder. She was thinking that the vaccine activated all that discomfort since she felt it from the left part of shoulder, went down to her chest like a v, and back up to her right shoulder. Every time she took a breath she had a chest spasm and it was hard to breathe. The events required a visit to emergency room. For treatment, they gave her medication to take called robaxin, it was an anti-spasm, and 800mg of ibuprofen. She took robaxin Sunday night, Monday, and she took one on Tuesday since she was feeling better. She was sensitive to medication. She felt dizzy and nausea from Robaxin. The patient had recovered from the events completely by Wednesday on 27Jan2021. She had a reminder to return for the second dose on 10Feb2021. She was asking if she should get the second dose.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

The next day she was more lethargic, coughing.  Called her PCP, recommended Robitussin and Mucinex which she took.  Continued to feel worse.  No fever although she had cold sweats.  She felt a lot of GI pain, fullness, could not eat/drink.  Called PCP again by the 4th day of feeling bad.  Recommended Augmentin and she took 2 doses.  On 3/12 and 3/13, had difficulty breathing, coughing.  Called EMS on 3/14 and taken to hospital where she was treated for dehydration and pneumonia with a broad spectrum antibiotic and vancomycin, IV.  Given morphine for pain.  She tried to take a  GI cocktail which she felt like she was choking on. That evening on her BP bottomed out.  They continued to give IVFs to raise BP as fast as possible. She was unable to receive chest compressions due to aorta issue and her heart gave out and she stopped breathing on 3/14.

                                                Within 5 minutes I became very light headed and weak.  Also very hot and shaky. They had to put me into another room that was much cooler and put me into a recliner with feet up, ice behind my neck and on my forehead. I was pushing water so it was not dehydration, and I had eaten my normal healty breakfast also so not low blood sugar. This was my second shot and I had the same reaction with the first shot. It took about an hour before I could stand and walk again, but was still a bit shaky and faintly light headed for about another hour.

She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included: cholesterol, spinal fusion L4/5, stenosis, allergies to medications, food, or other products: kefex, Zithromax, levofloxacin, oxycontin, methylprednisolone, Lisinopril, ezetimibe, Amlodipine.  She reported she has constant spiking of her blood pressure (BP) and lack of sleep for 37 days (average 1-3 hours daily), since the vaccination. She described the following: She has experienced &#34;dizziness, blurred vision at times, extreme and constant headaches, tons and tons of pain in her neck&#34;. She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function&#34;. When she &#34;lays down&#34;, her &#34;heart is racing so fast and [her] BP gets so high that it won&#39;t let [her] sleep&#34;. She feels like her &#34;body is going crazy&#34;. She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours. So weak &amp; constant neck pain that feels like someone is placing pressure around my neck. The blood pressure medication received are the following: Amlodipine from 1Feb2021 until 9Feb2021. She explained it work well to manage her BP but she &#34;could not urinate and had red flashes in [her] face&#34;; therefore, it was stopped by her cardiologist. She was off the BP medication from 9Feb2021 until 17Feb2021. Metoprolol from 18Feb2021 until 25Feb2021, but it didn&#39;t work. She explained it was stopped by her doctor because of side effects. Propranolol in combination with Alprazolam as needed for anxiety. She explained she &#34;took 3&#34; of the tablets for anxiety. Hydralazine 25mg which she started yesterday, after seeing her cardiologist. She explained she only got 3 hours of sleep last night. She woke up around 1:30am/2am&#34; her heartrate was at &#34;93&#34; and she put heat and cold on her neck to settle the pain. She specified the headache and pain were so bad it lasted for 1.5 hours, and her BP was 150/93 at 3 am .She added she had a &#34;red and flushed face&#34; and therefore took a &#34;Benadryl at 4am&#34;. She explained her BP was down to &#34;125/78&#34;, after taking the Benadryl, but got up to &#34;147/90&#34; at 7 am when she attempted to call Pfizer. She explained she has &#34;done [her] due diligence: she consulted HCP, did all the test, she attempted to go for walks and do activities she can tolerate, but her symptoms persist. She added she use to golf and cannot anymore. She explained her symptoms are persisting until this day and her body won&#39;t handle it further. She mentioned she knows she is COVID-19 free because when helping take care of her quadriplegic son in the summer, she tested negative. Outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : PFIZER INC-2021277006 same patient, different vaccine dose/AE.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 08Mar2021 15:30 (3:30 PM) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hashimottos (reported as hoshimottos) Diagnosed 35 years ago, hypermobile Diagnosed 20 years ago, and disorder nomia Diagnosed 25 years ago; all unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); diazepam (VALIUM); and levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 on 15Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization first dose at the left arm and experienced immobile for a day, cannot walk, weakness and sore arm. The patient was to know if there is going to be a booster for the Pfizer covid vaccine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer covid vaccine both doses and she is calling to report the reaction she had with the first and second dose to help other patients, she said she was close to death after the second dose. In the middle of the night she was awaken due to excruciating pain in the body, like truck ran over her. The patient heard that someone had same reaction who was in the hospital, with similar symptoms to covid. She said she felt like if her internal organ were shutting down. She does not do well with the antibiotic, and does not go to the doctors. She could not walk or eat after the second dose. She said she has hashimoto dysautonomia hypermobility. she said she thinks she might have had anaphylactic reaction. The patient added that she has lived through it and her experience has been very unusual. The caller has underlying conditions that may have caused this event, she received the second dose on 08Mar2021, it was a horrible experience but since she is still alive she would want to report it. The caller does have strange reactions to chemicals and she typically goes to naturopaths and holistic doctors because of this. The caller also has multiple autoimmune disorders and feels like that may have played a part in this reaction. It was added that further added that she received her second dose 08Mar2021 at 3:30pm and had a little bit of a sore arm, she was thinking positive thoughts about all of this because she never gets vaccines. At 2:00am on 09Mar2021 the caller was awaken in excruciating pain, every surgery she has had or accident manifests in the greatest pain. The pain was excruciating the caller took over the counter pain medicine and diclofenac and it didn&#39;t help. The caller is unsure of what she took, she may be making this up. The caller felt like she was dying, she felt like her internal organs were shutting down, it happened all week. The caller was so weak her husband fed her and made sure she was drinking. The caller thinks she would die if she had to have a booster shot of this vaccine. The caller has never had anaphylactic shock, could this have been anaphylactic shock? All of the pain from a surgery all occurred at once and her entire body was wrecking, in horrible pain, that she does not think heroin could have taken care of. After the second vaccine she was literally so weak that she felt like all of her vital organs were shutting down and it lasted for 6 days, like she got hit by a truck, like had beat her up. The caller knows that there are new found reactions with (Company name) and they stopped thousands of doses because of it, she saw this in the news today. The patient wanted to make note that she has underlying autoimmune diseases, she is unsure if there is a correlation between this and her reaction. The caller was changing from her thyroid medicine and her thyroid went very high with the generic brand so she was swapped to Synthroid in the middle of this. The caller was on levothyroxine and it wasn&#39;t working, her thyroid was sky high (Unknown lot number and expiration date Feb2022). The caller was going through all of these changes as well when she received the vaccine. The caller&#39;s doctor took a test and the caller has antibodies and they are there but not very strong. The caller doesn&#39;t want to be spreading something because she is feeling healthy and fine today. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Stated  all of a sudden her eyes were blurry and then she never gets headaches and her head felt like somebody put a spike in it on the right side, stated  it is supposed to affect the left side. stated she has a heart problem. The patient stated she had a sore arm for about a week, lasted for a few days. stated she gets a  sore arm with the flu shot. stated when she would roll over to lay on her left side and roll over on that arm it was enough to wake her up. stated it lasted about 5 days. She couldn&#39;t figure out why it was lasting so long. Stated the second thing that happened was that she went to her son&#39;s home that night for dinner, hadn&#39;t told him about it and while she was eating dinner she asked am if she leaning to the left and he said yes, she was and that her words were being slurred and only lasted for about 10 mins. Stated she didn&#39;t call and ignorance is unreal with this stuff. She went to urgent care the next day and they didn&#39;t call the ambulance. When she went to the doctor on 23 Feb2021 she was sent immediately to Hospital so she could go through the ER and that&#39;s when the neurosurgeon became involved.

                                                At approximately 930am I arrived at Memory Care.  I met with the director of the facility and she directed me to where my team would be setting up.  My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt&#39;s room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her. She also stated that the hospice Nurse believes that the death was primarily caused by her detiorating state. She also stated that the hospice Nurse informed that the death was not due to the Vaccine. Per Lead Pharmacist at the clinic.

                                                When I awoke this morning and was getting dressed, I noticed a soreness in the back of my left leg (on the right side of the left leg).  I felt a lump,  It was about 2-3 inches above the knee.  It was what I would describe as a medium-sized lump.  I called my doctor to leave a message about my symptoms.  My doctor called  a few minutes after 11 am and asked me to immediately come in so he could see the lump.  He thought I might have a blood clot.  This lump was not present late last night because when I put lotion on my legs after my shower, I felt no lump or soreness.  I worked out this morning and by 11:00, it seemed to me the lump was not as big as it was when I was getting dressed earlier this morning.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration upper arm probably only about 4inches down from shoulder blade on the left on 12Jan2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID on 01Oct2020. Concomitant medication included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) as blood thinner. The patient previously took a flu and shingles shot and experienced her redness and swelling on her arm. The patient did not have vaccinations four weeks prior, and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. She got it because she was told by her doctor that her antibodies will not last forever and it was still necessary to get it even though she already had COVID antibodies. She contracted COVID on 01Oct2020, that was the date when she had a positive test then she was last tested in December and she still had the antibodies then. She received her first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday 12Jan2021 and 24 hours later on 13Jan2021, she experienced chills and feeling very hot, which she took Tylenol extra strength for and it disappeared the next day. Her arm also swelled, not the whole arm, she would say about 3 inches around the site, 4 inches at the most and it was still swollen, it was red and itchy. Then she woke up in a horrible sweat but by the following morning it was gone. She wouldn&#39;t say it was a horrible reaction but she wanted to be certain she can go ahead and get the second shot which she had an appointment for. She said everything has resolved completely except for the swelling, her arm was still swollen, itchy, and red. Since the swelling, redness and itchiness began she would say it was slightly better than it was. The patient received the vaccine at an independent assisted living facility, not a military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events chills, feeling very hot and woke up in a horrible sweat was recovered on 14Jan2021, while the remaining events was recovering.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the covid vaccine, I developed a red flush on my face which was bright, hot and uncomfortable. The flush appeared nowhere else on my  body so I concluded that the vaccine must have interacted with the tretinoin cream I use nightly. That is the only area of my skin on which i apply the cream. When I got home, I applied soothing skin cream but no relief. I then tried aloe, which grows in the area, and the flush/burning abated somewhat. The next day, my face was still flushed but less red. the skin surface was scaly. I am continuing to treat at home. No MDs involved.

                                                little depressed; not feeling like herself; weak; tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose on the left arm on 19Dec2020 10:30 (lot number: EL0140). Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had no side effects after the first vaccine except for a little tenderness which went away. On 11Jan2021, after receiving the second dose, she felt really tired but which went away. On 20Jan2021 (last Wednesday), she started to feel tired, weak, and not feeling like herself. On 22Jan2021, the patient was a little depressed. She did not have a headache. Her blood pressure was fine and she never had a fever. She had an X-ray back in Sep2020. Her vision is good. She is not hurting anywhere. She doesn&#39;t feel as strong. She doesn&#39;t understand the tiredness, weakness, and depression. Outcome of the event tired was recovered on 11Jan2021, of the events doesn&#39;t feel like herself and weak was not recovered, and of the event depression was recovering. The reporter assessed all the events as related to the bnt162b2. The events depression and doesn&#39;t feel like herself were reported as serious: medically significant while the other events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory role of bnt162b2 in triggering the onset depression and doesn&#39;t feel like herself cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) from a Pfizer Sponsored program.  A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 25Jan2021 at 13:00 (at 78 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included anxiety, headache, dry eye and low potassium, each from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included potassium oral at 10 meq daily for low potassium, cholecalciferol (D3) oral at 2000 iU once a day to help with bones, fish oil oral at 1200 mg once a day, alprazolam at 0.5 mg as needed (take one three times a day) for anxiety, clonazepam oral at 0.5 mg once a day for anxiety, nortriptyline HCl oral at 10 mg once a day, paracetamol (TYLENOL) at 500 mg as needed for headache, estradiol (SYSTEN) ophthalmic one drop as needed, all from an unknown date and ongoing.  The patient experienced one or two hours after the vaccine (on 25Jan2021), she went to talk, she couldn&#39;t get her sentence straight. She knew what she wanted to say but she couldn&#39;t say it. Her first thought was that she was having a stroke and it really scared her. She became very tired and went to sleep, when she woke up, she was talking straight but she was still really tired. The next morning (on 26Jan2021) she had diarrhea three time and after that she felt better. The patient outcome of speech disorder and diarrhea was recovered on 26Jan2021 and the outcome of tiredness was recovering.  The information on the batch number has been requested.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (manufacture unknown, Lot Number: 9264), intramuscularly in left arm on 29Jan2021 14:55 at 0.3 ml, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included non-hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from Jul2019 and ongoing (The first time she was diagnosed was Jul2019. She then went into remission and then got the cancer back, she doesn&#39;t know when. She knows they started treating it as the cancer had returned in Aug 2020), watering eyes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine), chemotherapy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (she is a cancer patient on chemotherapy), fever blister from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced she had bell&#39;s palsy and she does not know if she got this from the covid shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. on 02Feb2021, droop in her lip/mouth on 02Feb2021, her eye was still watering on 02Feb2021, there was a little puffing around the eye/ puffiness around her eye on 02Feb2021, double vision on an unspecified date, the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech on an unspecified date. Caller was calling about the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She said on Friday 29Jan2021 she had the first shot at about 12:30. Her eye started watering in the morning Thursday the day before and she maybe assumed she was getting a cold in her eye but it was really runny and she got the shot. She was a cancer patient on chemo and she went to the doctor because she was supposed to get her chemo. That Tuesday morning she had a droopy lip on the right side and her eye was still watering, there was a little puffing around the eye and the way she talked she kind of had slurred speech so she thought stroke but she was going to get her chemo in an hour or 2 so she when they checked her she told them what happened, she was seeing the PA that day so she left and came back 10 minutes later and said she had talked to the doctor, they were not going to give chemo today and told her she had Bell&#39;s Palsy and she does not know if she got this from the COVID shot or not but she still has the droopy lip which apparently that can last a while. This was her first shot so as a cancer patient on chemo should be getting the second shot 21Feb. She was concerned about taking that when she already has Bell&#39;s Palsy now, what else would it cause and then if she does not get it would she be 50 % protected. The doctor seemed to say she thought it was from the vaccine, but caller does not know because the eye watering began the day or 2 prior to getting the vaccine. Product details: She does not have the vaccine card right with her and she was using a walker to get up and down and so she was not able to provide NDC lot expiration right now. It would be available if needed at a later time. Indication: doctor said she should have it because she has no immune system. They don&#39;t know what to do they are just following what they told her and they were scared to death. The caller states she was a cancer patient on chemotherapy. She received her first Pfizer COVID-19 injection on Friday, 29Jan2021. Prior to the vaccine, her eye had been watering Thursday or Friday morning before she had shot, it was just her right eye. On Tuesday, 02Feb2021, she developed a droop in her mouth and puffiness around her eye and so forth. Caller clarified it was just on the right side and with her right eye. She also has double vision in her right eye. She got up in the morning on 02Feb2021, and her husband was in the other room and told her that she sounded funny. She explained to her husband her mouth was dry and she was kind of slurring her speech. Her husband came into the room she was in and said, &#34;huh, your lip was drooping&#34;. Since it was in the morning and she had no other symptoms besides the talking funny and the puffiness around her eye, she didn&#39;t take it as a stroke. She figured she would just until she went to her chemotherapy appointment she had the same day, 02Feb2021. She went into her appointment and showed the person and gave her information on what happened. The person wanted an MRI of the brain to make sure she didn&#39;t have cancer there or cancer anywhere else up in that area and also that she didn&#39;t have a stroke. She confirms the MRI was fine, both were negative for any signs of this. She was told she developed bell&#39;s palsy. She has a drooping lip. The caller was concerned about her second shot. She wants to know should she getting the second vaccine, because the person at the (institution name) office (where she receives her chemotherapy) believes the bell&#39;s palsy came from the COVID-19 vaccine. She was supposed to have chemotherapy that day (02Feb2021), but they wouldn&#39;t give it to her then, but she did have it done yesterday. Caller explains she has no NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the chemotherapy she receives. She isn&#39;t given any stuff with any numbers and she gets numerous medications. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination): Her eye was watering before the injection. She knows her eye was watering before she received the vaccine because as she was sitting waiting to receive her injection, she remembers wiping her eye and thinking to herself, &#34;I wish this eye would quit watering&#34;. Caller states she had a fever blister, but she was not quite sure about when this appeared. She doesn&#39;t know if she had developed the fever blister before or the next day after receiving the vaccine, she was not quite sure. The any events were not required a visit to Emergency Room. She went to the Oncology Office for her chemotherapy appointment. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Caller had the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) on 02Feb2021 showed she didn&#39;t have a stroke and no cancer of the brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: negative on 02Feb2021 Negative for stroke and/or cancer. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Now the whole joint is red and a few of the other nodes have turned red.    Except for binding the first finger with the hope it would help (it didn&#39;t), I&#39;m not treating them, since of course one can&#39;t do anything about osteoarthritis except ease the pain.

                                                felt fairly decent/feel bad; she &#34;came down with covid&#34;/test positive for COVID; she is kind of weak; her heart was racing; aching/aches; she ran a fever that got up to 101; cough; her arm got sore; allergies; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-years-old female patient receive first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) on 15Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID Prevention. Medical history included ongoing High Blood Pressure, she was diagnosed approximately 5 years prior to starting blood pressure medications in 1998. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) at 320mg/12.5mg, once daily, by mouth from 1998 and ongoing, amlodipine besylate at 5mg, once daily, by mouth at night from 1998, both for High blood pressure. The patient stated that she did not realize, but she must have been exposed to the COVID Virus, prior to getting her shot. She stated that on 15Jan2021, she went and got her Pfizer COVID shot, and that same day, by the time she got home, she was starting to feel bad and it went downhill from there. She mentioned that on the same day on 15Jan2021, she &#34;came down with covid&#34;. She finally went in on 22Jan2021, and got tested, and she did test positive for COVID. The patient was tested Positive for COVID-19 on 22Jan2021. She did believe she was getting better. On 29Jan2021, she felt fairly decent, and today, she is kind of weak but she is assuming that will happen. She was scheduled to go back for her second dose on 08Feb2021, and she is wondering if there are recommendations about the second dose, for people who tested positive for COVID after having gotten the first dose. When queried for her PCP contact information, she stated that her head is not working really great and she feels stupid she did not have this information handy to provide. She states that the first week with her symptoms, she just figured she did have the virus. She had a cough but it never got down to where she had trouble breathing, and she just figured that her body had to go through, whatever it was going to go through, and as long as the patient felt like she was okay, there was not anything anyone could do, she just had to play it out. When she did finally go get tested, the doctor told her to get on Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what the patient has been taking, and she feels like it has helped a lot. Before she saw the doctor, she was taking Acetaminophen, but the doctor told her to do the Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what she has been doing. By the time she got home from getting her vaccine, her heart was racing. She took her blood pressure and it was okay at 125/73, and her heart rate was 72. She has high blood pressure and she takes two medications for that, so she took her night time blood pressure pill and the fast beating of her heart went away. The next day, she got to aching. She has had all different aches, and she ran a fever that got up to 101, and the rest of the time it was 100 or 99, but the fevers were not all day long, they would just come and go. Now she has had no fever in four or more days, and she is doing better. She does still have the cough, but she also has allergies so she does not know what is causing the cough. As far as the reaction to the vaccine, just her arm got sore. But she thinks she was exposed prior to getting the vaccine and just did not know it. she stated that the people took her temperature the day of the shot and she didn&#39;t have a temperature. She did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of fever was recovering, of cough and allergies was not recovered, of her heart was racing was recovered.

                                                I was vaccinated with Pfizer for the first time 11 days ago. Within a few minutes of being vaccinated, I felt nauseated but I did NOT throw up. I have been sick ever since with one thing and another. For the first several days after being vaccinated, I had a sore arm, which I expected. I have also experienced extreme fatigue, chills, nausea, muscle and joint aches, a sore throat (briefly), an occasional headache, tenderness in my left armpit and along the left side of my rib cage, stomach pain and diarrhea and at times, a low-grade fever and sweating. My memory and ability to focus on my work have been affected. Yesterday (March 13), I felt OK all day and thought I was better at last, but after I ate dinner, I vomited and had diarrhea. I told my primary care physician about all of this in an email and she replied that my symptoms were &#34;normal.&#34; I&#39;m not so sure. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else feeling so sick for so long after the first dose of Pfizer.

It was reported that Patient experiencing muscle cramping in the right calf, began 30Jan2021 9:15am, cramping started that afternoon. 6 hours later or so. Patient questioned was this a normal side effect. Just feels different. The Fax sheet he received stating the indication was to administer the vaccine as 2 doses, 3 weeks apart. However, the card he received at vaccination center had both him and his wife scheduled 27Feb2021 which was 4 weeks. He also had to report a side effect for his wife. His wife got her vaccine on the left arm, but right leg calf muscle was constantly acting like a Charlie Horse, it&#39;s cramping, like the muscle was pulling in the right calf. His Wife&#39;s first dose was on 30Jan2021 at 9:15 AM, and in the afternoon on the same day was when right calf cramping started, since then it has been constant. The Right Calf Cramping was definitely the same. He did not know if it was worse or not but she was just complaining last night about it, it&#39;s continuing, it has caused her to wake up during the night. for both him and his wife the second dose may be schedule on 27Feb2021. He clarifies that he was not sure what his wife was told, but the young woman gave the same date on his card and said this was the earliest date that he can be scheduled. Outcome of the event was not recovered

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6201), intramuscular, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021, 14:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy in feet, cholesterol (abnormal), 2 vertebra in her back that are starting to fuse, shrinking as she&#39;s getting older, allergic to NSAIDS, she clarifies Advil, Tylenol and the medications reverses on her and gives her a headache, and she gets itchy; was in the hospital for surgery, for lady stuff and needs glasses. She doesn&#39;t have a heart problem she doesn&#39;t have any other medical issues. She&#39;s not diabetic the neuropathy was idiopathic.  Concomitant medications included atorvastatin for cholesterol (abnormal), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA). The patient previously took morphine and was allergic, and hallucinating as she was told by the nurse, she said there were monkeys on the ceiling and her husband was trying to kill her and gets itchy with morphine. This is the same reaction she had when found out she had the reaction to NSAIDs, for example, she could take Advil or Tylenol for one night but it she took it two nights, that was when she woke up itching all over. She reports no rash, just itch. It just lasted that one night and it was gone. She could take some Advil and get that itchy feeling. On 01Mar2021, the patient experienced left arm aching from the site of the injection back down under the back of her arm to the back part of her elbow, then it comes to the far outer part of her forearm down to the wrist and ring finger and pinky finger; numbness down left arm/it was also partially numb, she has feeling because it&#39;s aching and she was describing it as an ache, not sharp just an ache. She can feel it, but its not all there. She knows all this stuff was new to all of us. She&#39;s following up and doesn&#39;t keep her up at night it&#39;s just not normal; and on 24Feb2021, her torso, the night after injection, from her armpits to her hips was itchy. She woke up and she went to the bathroom scratching her back and stomach. Her Covid 19 vaccine card was handwritten she sees 23Feb2021 and that&#39;s the date she got the shot. She&#39;s been isolating since Feb2020. She was only going out for necessity. She took a risk and had family at her home for Christmas. She hasn&#39;t been to church in almost a year, so she was taking this very seriously. Before they even started telling you to wear a mask she was listening to the news in December and January. She states, alright she&#39;s isolating, it&#39;s the safest thing she can do she&#39;s not ready to leave this world yet even knowing she&#39;s past her golden years. Her doctor put her on Atorvastatin it because of her age, she had blood drawn but she wasn&#39;t given any counts on an unspecified date. Her first thought was she had a chest problem but it&#39;s not a heart attack, the ache doesn&#39;t go any farther than what she told. It&#39;s not stopping her from being productive, from doing things. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room, physician office and was not hospitalized. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no events following prior vaccinations.

                                                I had the second Covid (Pfizer) vaccine on February 22. The next day I had chills, fever, aches, nausea and was very weak. After about 30 hours I felt okay again.  However, a week and a half later, I noticed red bumps on the back of my neck. The next day, my neck and scalp had red, itchy blotches. Through the next five days, these spread down my body to my ankles until I was covered with the red, very itchy blotches. I did go to Urgent Care on the third day and I was given a 5-day prescription of Prednisone. It did not do much until the third day and then it relieved the itching somewhat for about 6 hours, but then it would start again. After the five days of Prednisone, I took Benedryl for three days until the itch and redness disappeared.  I checked the facility web site on types of rashes and my rash fits the description (and the photo) of a drug-related rash, but I have not changed or added any drugs for several years other than the Covid vaccine (I did some research online and found two other people who have had the same problems I have had after the second Covid vaccine. Both of them had the typical reaction of chills, fever, aches and dizziness for about a day after the second shot and then 1-2 weeks later, broke out in a rash. Both reported having the rash start at the neck or head and then spreading down the body throughout one to two weeks before disappearing. There were photos on the facility site of drug-related rashes and they were exactly like what I had.  Since the rash was almost certainly covid vaccine related, I am making this report, which my doctor recommended. I had no other changes in diet, medications, environment, etc. ? only the Pfizer vaccine was new to my body.

A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, second dose on 10mar2021 (formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EIV6202) via an unspecified route of administration at single dose for covid 19 immunisation. The patient medical history included ongoing tubular dysfunction, migraine and patient had the vestibular Dysfunction from 40 years, ongoing migraine headache. The patient historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EL9267), (first dose) via an unspecified route of administration on 17feb2021 at single dose for covid 19 immunisation and took Flu shot for immunization. The patient had regular flu shot a few years ago it was mentioned that doctor told get a Benadryl an hour before my shot which I did and she was in the hospital for 5 hours on a Breathing machine. Concomitant medications included rizatriptan benzoate (MAXALT) at 10 mg, as needed for migraine. Consumer stated, &#34;I had Tubular Dysfunction been diagnosed many years ago and I live with dizzy every day In Mar2021. I have tried everything to get rid of it and nothing is working. This is going on for Probably 40 years may be more anyway (Intent: History). I had my second vaccine on 10Mar2021 and on the first day, my doctor told me since I had the reaction to the regular Flu shot a few years ago my doctor told me get a Benadryl an hour before my shot which I did and the first day everything was wonderful. I was so happy you know no reaction, I didn&#39;t have any. The first time I got the flu shot I was in the hospital for 5 hours on a Breathing machine, it was beautiful. I thought I was free and then the next day my arm got real sore and I expected that and I expected to have a fever I expected to feel nauseous and all but the dizziness set in and just got progressively worse and it will be a week tomorrow since the vaccine still I was dizzy In Mar2021. I have been so off-center In Mar2021. Sunday I could hardly do over I was just so sick with the dizziness and yesterday the same thing and this morning I thought I will get over maybe today will be a good day and it&#39;s the same. I called my neurologist and he said that any pre-existing condition can be exaggerated by the vaccine while the system is building up his anti-bodies so I expected but is this going to go away, this thing, is this going to go away and reported just so beside myself, I just can&#39;t live like this anymore everyday you know this is beyond dizzy.&#34; tried taking, I do have a prescription for it starts with M wait a minute it hasn&#39;t helped but I tried it , if it doesn&#39;t help for the first time I won&#39;t take it again but I have a prescription for Meclizine 25 mg Tablets. Consumer stated, &#34;I spoke to somebody earlier and told me to call this number and tell you that what&#39;s going with me. Tomorrow will be one week, since I had my second Covid shot and the first day, I got it everything was fine. The second day I was feeling a little off and I thought okay will they told me that I would feel little, may be not sick-sick but not feeling good and then the second day after that Friday. I got it on Wednesday and by Friday, I have a pre-existing condition and it is called Vestibular Dysfunction. Consumer stated, &#34;I had the Vestibular Dysfunction from 40 years. So, I live with dizzy all the time. But by Friday, it is just unbelievable dizzy, Saturday was worse, Sunday was even worse, yesterday was little bit better. Today, I am still shaking and dizzy and Tomorrow will be one week since I have the shot and I read that stuff happened in the first week and I was wondering, have you had the other people with the same problem, Consumer further added, &#34;It is not an inconvenience, this is horrible way to live. I feel dizzy all the time, this is horrible. Was I told that I should talk to you about, can the shot exacerbate a bad situation like this, they told me to call you, now I getting no help at all can anybody tell me.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Nothing I have no recollection of any of that no, I just started coughing and they told me to go to the emergency room so I did you know In Mar2021. The patient has received treatment with Meclizine 25 mg tablets. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 11:00, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included silent heart attack, ongoing Barrett&#39;s oesophagus from 2008, fall she had over two months (2021), eye surgery on an unknown date. She does not get any shots and can&#39;t have shots even for the flu shot because she had problems with two flu shots she had; states she had a problem with each one of the flu shots and does not know the names of the flu shots and has no lot numbers to provide for them; states she had the flu shots in the early 1990&#39;s and worked in healthcare and had to have them and they told her back then if she wanted to work she had to have the flu shots and then she got sick with both of the flu shots and they said they guessed they would not force her to have the flu shots. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose administered and then about 14 hours after (12Mar2021) that she had no problems until it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours. She does not know what to do about getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine and was at her cardiologist&#39;s this week and he said he is not familiar with the Pfizer vaccine causing chest pain; caller states she has a history of silent heart attacks. She still has tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight and they told her to mention if she does go for the second dose of the vaccine to mention that she had this situation.The chest pain and arm pain began 12Mar2021 and the arm pain is in her right arm where the vaccine was administered and the arm pain and chest pain have resolved; states the arm pain and chest pain stopped and she thinks that lasted about an hour and a half and she called a family member to take her to the hospital; states about 2:30am that same day she was admitted the morning of 12Mar2021 and was discharged on 13Mar2021. They ran every test known to the patient and for a while her blood pressure went up to 198/203 in the emergency room (12Mar2021) and she is not on any medication; caller states she does have Crestor but has not started on it and has not taken it yet. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight began the same time she was having the chest pain and she is not having any chest pain or anything like that right now but the tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight is still ongoing; states she did go get cardiac clearance to make sure which was this past week and she does not feel well and like for her the tiredness is bugging her. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing are better but she knows they are there and she tries to swallow something and is like boy her throat is still tight. They did an ultrasound in her left leg because she was limping from a fall she had over two months ago but still has a sore ankle from that and they sent her down for the ultrasound and a CT looking for blood clots in her lungs because she was short of breath (12Mar2021); caller states she thinks they were running everything they could to rule out things; states everything was negative for the CT and ultrasound and she believes the CT and ultrasound were done on 12Mar2021. She has no idea when she was diagnosed with silent heart attacks but they kept asking her about this when she went in for eye surgery and asked her when she had a heart attack and she said she had never had one and they said yes she had and she never knew. She just set up a HCP appointment after the reported events with a gastroenterologist because she has Barrett&#39;s and because of the esophagus she did not know if it flared up by the Pfizer vaccine and that caused the pain because the two pains of the heart and esophagus mimic each other with pain going up into the jaw so they were ruling out which one it was; states she went out as an atypical chest pain and called the cardiologist and went in and went over her records from the hospital with the cardiologist. She does not know what caused what in terms of the pain. The outcome of the event blood pressure increased was unknown, chest pain and pain in arm was recovered, other events was recovering.

A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Mar2021 12:10 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine on 23Feb2021 (lot number: EN6198 with expiry date 31May2021) for Covid-19 immunization. The patient experienced passed out for a very short period of  time and awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking on 18Mar2021; her body felt warm but then she was freezing, she was sick and was different and very weak, and muscles were sore in Mar2021. It was further reported that the patient got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine that day on 17Mar2021 and about 12:45am or 1:30am the next morning she was awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking; the shaking has resolved completely but she is not sure when it resolved but she was shaking for a good while because she can remember being so uncomfortable with her body moving so much which went on for maybe 20 minutes or so when her husband woke up.Patient&#39;s husband then woke up and got Ibuprofen and gave it to her and that stopped the shaking which surprised her and she did not know the Ibuprofen would work to stop the shaking that well and the Ibuprofen did work in stopping the shaking. The Ibuprofen stopped the shaking and she can remember to touch her body felt warm but then she was freezing and she does not know what this means but this was not ongoing and resolved when her husband gave her the ibuprofen and she stopped shaking right away which always amazed her that the Ibuprofen worked. She stated fortunately the Ibuprofen stopped her from shaking and she was able to sleep until early morning when she woke up and knew she was sick and was different and very weak; states the weakness was not ongoing and the approximate time the weakness resolved was unknown but she was down the rest of the day and after that she passed out for a very short period of  time and held her head up and stood up and thought wow something was going on and asked where was this coming from and it was not nausea but she was just weak. She has not passed out for a huge amount of time but fortunately she had some towels laying close by and was able to use a towel; states after that she stopped for the rest of the day and only got up to go to the potty and was just so weak and heard that from many people that they just slept afterwards.Caller states her muscles were sore and she realized that was just normal and after the 2nd dose of the vaccine she knew her muscles would probably be sore and this was resolved. She came downstairs and was sitting on a chair and then stood and no longer sat in the chair and her husband knew things were not right with her and her eyes looked funny and she passed out and that never happened to her before and she was passed out for a few moments. Other than the Ibuprofen she did not have treatment and did not go to the emergency room or the HCP office. Patient only took one Ibuprofen and she has a very small body and her husband sometimes takes 2-3 Ibuprofen and she thinks wow that is so many but she herself does not have any medication and she just took one Ibuprofen and it worked; She took the Ibuprofen on 18Mar2021 in the early morning. Fortunately she was in good health. Outcome of the event passed out for a very short period of  time, was awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking and muscles were sore was recovered in Mar2021, and unknown outcome for the remaining events.

                                                Pneumonia after getting the COVID Vaccine; Pneumonia was related to MRSA; Very weak; mild fever; This is spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband). A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 78-years-old, administered in arm on 25Feb2021 15:45 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus from 2011 (Verbatim: Diabetic; Diagnosed 10 years ago), rheumatoid arthritis from 1995 (Verbatim: Rheumatoid arthritis; Diagnosed in 1995), cardiac failure congestive from Oct2020 (Verbatim: Congestive Heart Failure), adrenal insufficiency from 1990 (Verbatim: Adrenal insufficiency; Diagnosed in probably 1990), atrial fibrillation from 2017 (Verbatim: Atrial fibrillation; Diagnosed 4 years ago). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications (&#34;she takes lots of medications. Too long of list she probably takes 15 different medications, reporter chose not to provide them). No-other vaccines were given at the same time. She gets the flu vaccine every year, shingles vaccines, pneumonia vaccines every year but, has no idea where they were manufactured. Confirmed she did not get the listed vaccines at the same time she got the COVID Vaccine. The patient&#39;s husband and the patient (his wife) both received their 1st COVID shot on the 25Feb2021 and was scheduled for 3 weeks later. He got his COVID on the 18Mar2021. The patient got Pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital but he does not know the exact time the Pneumonia started. It developed over a period of several day started with a mild fever (in Mar2021) and after the 2nd or 3rd day her fever spiked and that&#39;s when she was admitted to the hospital. He reports his wife went into the hospital with Pneumonia on 18Mar2021, the day she was supposed to get the 2nd shot. It was also reported that Pneumonia was related to MRSA. She laid up in the hospital for 2 weeks, the weakness (&#34;very weak&#34;) may have happened in the hospital or a few days before, date was confirmed to be on 15Mar2021. The event &#34;pneumonia&#34; was totally unrelated to COVID and now she is in a nursing home, she went in on 26Mar2021. She probably won&#39;t be able to have the 2nd shot for a couple of weeks. She was in there for a couple of weeks and still quarantined. He wanted to know will the fact that she is not getting the 2nd shot at the 3-week interval reduce the efficacy of the vaccine since she is getting the 2nd dose late. Does it make a difference with the effectiveness of the vaccine if she&#39;s going take the 2nd dose 3-4 weeks or even a month and a half rather than the usual 21 days interval? No treatment before going to the hospital other than calling the doctor and the doctor saying take her to the hospital (not reported if patient received treatment during hospital stay). No treatment done over the weekend, while she was in the nursing home. The adverse event pneumonia required a visit to Emergency Room. The patient was hospitalized from 18Mar2021 to 26Mar2021. Investigations included had a lot of blood work done, a CT scan, an X-ray on unspecified dates. He does not have any of the results but, the physicians have them. The outcome of the event mild fever was unknown, for very weak was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovered on 26Mar2021.

A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 78 years, administered in right bicep on 16Mar2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history includes bells palsy from 1997, lower right lobe of her lung removed in 2016, and removed for carcinoid tumor on an unspecified date. Patient did not have prior vaccinations in 4 weeks. Concomitant medications were none. There were no other vaccines administered on the same date as the suspect. Patient previously too quite a few medications but she hasn&#39;t been taking for years or that would affect it. It was reported that patient and the reporter received first dose on 16Mar2021 at 09:00 AM in the right bicep as recommended by the pulmonologist and oncologist.  It was reported that on 29Mar2021, also reported as &#34;13 days later from vaccination&#34;, facial paralysis started around noon. At the time of report, patient was experiencing Bell&#39;s Palsy from 29Mar2021 and asking for recommendation for second dose. Patient was also officially diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy when she went to the ER on 31Mar2021. Patient has seen the doctor and been to the ER and the doctor refused to comment saying he had no opinion, they had asked him if she should do the second dose and he said he had no opinion. Reporter relayed that on the website there is no specific notable balance in the numerical groups to suggest a causal relationship to the vaccine. Reporter was asking if the second dose was prohibited, stating patient was scheduled for 06Apr2021 which is 21 days after her first dose. Patient&#39;s husband spoke from the FDA&#39;s briefing document that &#34;Bell&#39;s palsy was reported by four vaccine participants and none in the placebo group. These cases occurred at 3, 9, 37, and 48 days after vaccination,&#34; and mentioned that  there have been 4 reports of Bell&#39;s Palsy during the study and 1 of those was after the first dose and 3 were after the second dose. They wanted to know if it is allowed should she get it or could it be rescheduled to a later date. For tests, no testing was done they just did a visual exam on an unspecified date. Vaccine was not administered at Facility. The outcome was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number is requested.

                                                Loss of voice; Asthma; her voice became extremely hoarse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 09:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Family history included sore arm. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate, vilanterol trifenatate (BREO ELLIPTA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 (lot number: EN6198) on 23Feb2021 in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. About 3-4 days after (as reported), her voice became extremely hoarse, in which she lost a voice for 3 weeks. She mentioned that she was diagnosed with Asthma on 23Mar2021 and was started with a Breo Ellipta inhaler. The Breo had a listed side effect of hoarseness of voice in which she started a week after receiving the vaccine, to which her hoarseness became worse. She mentioned that according to the paperwork she received from Pfizer, hoarseness of the voice was also listed as a side effect. She consulted with her Pulmonologist who determined that the inhaler was working pretty well and would like to continue her on it and wanted to see if the hoarseness is still there by May. As of calling, she already has some of her voice back, but the hoarseness was still continuing, which gets worse in the afternoon or evening. She would like to know if this has been reported and for how long it will last. She had the injection/vaccine and hoarseness started about a week before she started on the Breo Ellipta inhaler (NDC: 01730859-10 Lot: UL4F Expiration: 10/2022 Dose: 100mcg/25mcg). She stated they both can cause the same thing with hoarseness. She clarified that when she lost her voice, it was just above a whisper. It had gotten progressively worse since it started a week prior. It lasted almost 3 weeks. Now she has started to get her voice back, but still has the hoarseness and this was as good as her voice gets, it gets worse in the afternoon and by 2:00 P.M. it was back down to no voice. She went down to see the pulmonary specialist and prescribed her 2 different inhalers. The specialist said it was an unusual hoarseness, but he couldn&#39;t tell what one it was from. The patient clarified she experienced the hoarseness first from the Pfizer Covid Vaccine after the second vaccine, and then a week later she started on the Breo Ellipta, and the hoarseness got worse. The doctor wants to wait until 19May2021 and see if she still has the hoarseness and then he might switch, but it was working so well, he didn&#39;t want to switch her yet. The patient was prescribed Breo Ellipta and Albuterol but she hasn&#39;t used the Albuterol. The patient reported that she considers the event as medically significant because hoarseness can cause cancer and she doesn&#39;t want it to get worse. No other vaccines administered on the same date of the BNT162B2 and no prior vaccination. The event hoarseness started on 18Mar2021 and loss of voice on 23Mar2021. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room. The outcome of the event hoarseness was not recovered, Loss of voice recovered on 13Apr2021 and asthma was unknown. The events hoarseness and loss of voice was reported as serious-medically significant.  Follow attempts are possible. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Hoarse voice and Loss of voice cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (also reported as Pfizer Covid vaccine, lot number: EK4176), intramuscular into left arm on 05Jan2021 16:00 at single dose indicated as presentation because she is a nurse/Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Type 2 Diabetes, about 2 years ago in 2019 in which she takes metformin 1,000mg twice daily. Concomitant medication included metformin on unspecified date at 1,000mg twice daily for Type 2 Diabetes. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine nor there were additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Covid vaccine. The patient received the Pfizer COVID vaccine last Tuesday and since 06Jan2021 at 06:00, she has been sick as a dog. She is running a fever, has chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite because she is nauseous; all on 06Jan2021 at 06:00. This is the third day of it.  She would like to know what she can she do. She said that it all started Wednesday morning when she got up. It just gets worse every day.  It looks like it would get better by now, but it hasn&#39;t.  She never runs a temperature, but she has now (unspecified date).  She is still freezing to death on unspecified date. She usually has a good appetite.  Even the thought of food makes her sick. She further reported that she has had nothing but chills, fever, and nausea and states it will not go away. She is treating it with ibuprofen. She confirms she already talked to a nurse in this department to report this and she was transferred to see what she could do and states they never answered. This is her first dose and she does not know if she should get the second dose. The patient can&#39;t calm down since she has been sick since last Wednesday. She stated that she needed some help because she is so sick. She was suggested to call again calling Pfizer medical information department. She stated that she had called back three times, but there is no such number. The events sick as a dog, fever, chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite, and nauseous were considered serious (Other medically important condition). The outcome of the events sick as a dog, fever, chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite, and nauseous was not recovered, and the outcome of the remaining event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completed based on known safety profile and a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included major reaction to eating conch, and tested positive for COVID on 22Nov2020 There were no concomitant medications. Patient read that was not a good thing to do, to get the vaccine after only 2 months instead of 3 from diagnoses. When she had COVID she had major headache, chills, and diarrhea. After the vaccine she had had the same thing, terrible chills, bad headache and diarrhea on Jan2021. The side effects say that this was normal but she wants to know should she have waited the 90 days before getting the vaccine. Patient still had the headache and chills but she took an Imodium and the diarrhea was better. Patient had also fatigue in Jan2021,and slept all day yesterday (13Jan2021). She has had a very sore arm and at 2am she woke up trembling with chills on Jan2021. Outcome of the event chills and headache was not recovered, for diarrhea was recovering and for the remaining events was unknown.

This 79 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284) in left arm, on 18Jan2021 at 12:00 PM or 01:00 PM, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pacemaker (she just had it checked on 18Jan2021 at the cardiologist and they said it was good for five more years), heart issue, dementia (before getting the vaccine). Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date in Jan2021 the patient experienced dementia (she had a bit of dementia right now, which she also had before getting the vaccine) and her feet felt like they were numb, like neuropathy (maybe she had that, it had never been checked). Since 19Jan2021 the patient could not walk, had difficulty in walking. She was using a cane as she did not want to fall, she weighed 200 lbs and her partner would never be able to get her up if she fell. She was able to walk with the cane. The patient said that there had been no other treatment for her difficulty in walking and it seemed to get better. The initial caller (patient&#39;s partner) said she had the shot too on 18Jan2021 and did not have those symptoms, she was not the one who was sick, she did not know what else was going on in her partner&#39;s body, they did not think the shot caused it. The patient said she was supposed to be on a sleep apnea machine but she could not get in to the doctor to get the machine checked, it needed a test to be rechecked but they could not get in to do it because of everything that is going on. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 08Feb2021 at 10:00AM. Difficulty in walking was improving. The other events outcome was unknown.

She exercises regularly and has become so weak that she cannot climb stairs.  Neurological exam revealed hyperreflexia, subtle proximal muscle weakness, the presence of a startle reflex and rooting reflex, clonus, and a positive Babinski.  Infectious work up has been negative, autoimmune evaluation is underway.  Inpatient neurology consultation has been obtained, she was given a trial of diazepam for stiff person syndrome and started on daily IVIG on 2/3/2021 for a 5 day course. She continues to have an elevated CRP, a mild transaminitis, and mild thrombocytopenia.  The ESR dropped from 44 to 20 with hydration.  She has had no cognitive changes. No headache, visual changes, jaw pain. We are unable to obtain MRI given the presence of these coils which are not MRI compatible.  Encephalitis immune antibodies are pending, myositis panel, MOG antibodies ADEM are pending, GAD65 antibody pending.

A 79-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine; Batch/lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration injection to right upper arm  on 22Jan2021 14:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing she was a fainter (She was a fainter, she just faints so she has a hard time getting shots. Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine administered to her by nurse while she was in her car seat. She just asked the nurse to let her lay down in the car seat when injection was administered so that if she fainted she would not fall far; she was still getting the wash cloth on her head preparing when the Nurse had already finished administering the injection.); ongoing depressed sometimes (she was depressed sometimes, was stressed. She was the primary caregiver for her 96 year old mother. She had seen something about stress and COVID and shots and everything); ongoing  Very tired (She was almost 80 years old so she was very tired often. She was the primary caregiver for her 96 year old mother. By the time she comes home at night around 21:30 she was just wiped.);  Obesity (She was really overweight but she did not like the term obesity.); thyroid disorder; hypertension; Cataract and glaucoma in left eye; family history of ongoing facial paralysis (Dad had Bell&#39;s palsy that might have been 30 years ago. He died at age 87 years.); diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes). Concomitant medication included Levothyroxine at 100mcg taken once daily in the morning early before she eats with Start date unknown, but at least 10-15 years ago for Thyroid. Enalapril at 10mg taken once daily (Caller initially reported product name as Vasotec, but clarified it is not Vasotec, it is drop for eye cataract and glaucoma) for High blood pressure. Brimonidine with Strength unknown, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily, started maybe 1 year ago. Specified cataract and glaucoma in left eye; but drop was administered to both eyes; and left eye was eye affected by Bell&#39;s palsy for Cataract and glaucoma in left eye. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergy with onset maybe about 50 years ago, she was not sure; occurred during dental procedure; had bad headaches but no lasting effects so they assumed allergy to codeine; she did not know if still has allergy but says she does if asked.  The patient experienced bell&#39;s palsy/developed facial drooping/her eye was drooping on 29Jan2021 with outcome of recovering, may have had a mini stroke on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown , fell on 27Jan2021 with outcome of unknown (reported date of end of reaction was 27Jan2021), she could not blink that eye on 29Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered. Five days later she fell and developed facial drooping.  HCP suggested she may have had a mini stroke causing facial drooping and the fall. She went to the ER on 29Jan2021 and the ER believed it was Bell&#39;s Palsy. She was still experiencing facial symptoms but they are improving.

She was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy in 29Jan2021 after having been seen in the emergency room. She is supposed to have the second dose/booster of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Feb2021. She called to ask if she should or should not still get the second dose as scheduled; and if Bell&#39;s palsy could be a reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The emergency room staff did not know how she got Bell&#39;s palsy, but knew she had the Pfizer COIVD-19 Vaccine and were kind of assuming the Bell&#39;s palsy was a reaction to the vaccine. She dis not have Bell&#39;s palsy bad. The emergency room staff thought at first she had a stroke before diagnosing her with Bell&#39;s palsy. On Wednesday, 27Jan2021 she had a friend named (Name withheld) who came over for tea. Patient has an oriental rug, and around 15:00 patient fell face first on oriental rug. She was just fine after the fall initially. She wonders if her having fell has anything to do with the Bell&#39;s palsy. She thinks it was the night of 27Jan2021 or 28Jan2021 when she asked her son if her face looked funny, did she look ok, because her face felt a little funny. She was looking in the mirror and her smile was looking crooked, and her eye looked like it was drooping. When she got up Friday, 29Jan2021 she could see her eye was drooping, and she could not blink that eye. She called her Ophthalmologist who saw her the afternoon of 29Jan2021 around 13:30-13:55. The Ophthalmologist said yeah something is going on with that eye. Her friend called his friend who is a Pediatric Neurologist that advised her to go to the emergency room.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 (at the age of 79-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cholesterol.  Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR).  The patient previously took Aspirin (e.c.) about 10-15 years ago and experienced anaphylactic reaction, Lyrica about 10-15 years ago for neuralgia and experienced hypersensitivity. The patient reported that on 10Feb2021, she got the vaccine. When she first obtained the vaccine, she was put in a holding situation in regards to having any reaction.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection lot number: EN6201), intramuscular at upper left arm on 17Feb2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis in right shoulder and arm gets inflamed and sore; rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm. It sometimes flares up and gets sore) diagnosed in late 2019, ongoing Autoimmune deficiency disease diagnosed in late 2019 and lower left eyelid which was inverted. There were no concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient previously took Shingrix vaccine (Shingles vaccine) at left arm last year-2020 and she felt soreness and achiness in right shoulder and arm. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine yesterday on 17Feb2021 at her left arm. A few hours later her right shoulder and right arm felt sore and achy. On 18Feb2021, the patient&#39;s right arm and shoulder were aching. The patient mentioned that this has also happened last year when she had a Shingrix vaccine. She was also injected in her left arm but her right arm got sore and achy. She felt soreness and achiness in right shoulder and arm. She wanted to know if this is a normal reaction from the vaccine. The patient stated that it was weird. On unspecified date, when she lifts her arm up high it hurts, she stated that she does have an inflamed shoulder. She did have an inflamed shoulder prior, it has been pretty good lately but flared up after the vaccine. During the night it was very bad. She does have rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm. It sometimes flares up and gets sore. She was wondering if there is a relationship with the COVID 19 vaccine because she felt like she got the COVID 19 vaccine in the right arm, she asked if she&#39;s reacting to the medication. No treatment was administered for right shoulder. Routine lab work done on 02Feb2021 but it has nothing to do with this. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The patient is also scheduled to have Botox in her lower eyelid for her left eye to release the nerve muscle. She asked if it is ok since she just had the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She is scheduled to get botox injection next week for lower left eyelid which is inverted, it was bothering her. They have to release the muscle by getting an injection of botox. She was receiving conflicting information from her PCP, who says wait a month and her ophthalmologist who says its ok to get the COVID 19 vaccine. She thought she heard something about not mixing botox with the vaccine. The outcome of the event &#34;She did have an inflamed shoulder prior, it has been pretty good lately but flared up after the vaccine/She does have rheumatoid arthritis in right shoulder and arm&#34; was unknown; and other events was recovering.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that when she got the first dose of the vaccine in Jan2021, she felt that the needle went in, she felt a little discomfort with the needle, had some blood on the band-aid, she felt achy in her arm afterwards in Jan2021; and her arm swelled up/had arm swelling on unspecified date. She did not feel anything with the second dose and there was no swelling like the first time. She asked the nurse if it went in for the second dose and the nurse said it did. The patient mentioned that there was nothing that showed like anything went in her arm when she received the second dose. She heard that the second one should feel something going on more than first time. She did not know if she could get another vaccination or what she needed to do.  Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On my right leg down close to the ankle I have a swelling that is showing bruising and a lump that is painful.  I am not sure if it is a clot or not. I have not been to Urgent care .  I informed people giving me vaccine I was on blood thinners.  Nobody seem to show concern about that.  I have already received 2nd shot, which I got very sick after, but symptoms seem to happen to others.  My concern is the lump on my leg if it is a clot and concern if I will get more now that I took the 2nd vaccine.

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 18Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

She started Prednisone 40mg on Monday and did get a few more hives on Tuesday and Wednesday. She had the shot in her right arm, and all this happened on the left side of her back. She had a patch of hive of 5x6 to 8x8 on her back and on the back of her arm by her elbow and forearm. She put apple cider vinegar on her arms, and she did not itch anymore. Someone told her that this could be shingles. She stated that she got flu vaccine and got sick with flu and she took the shingles vaccine and got shingles.

The patient did not want to take the second shot on 20Feb2021 and wanted to know what Pfizer thinks. She does like to travel and hopes to soon so she wanted to know if not taking the shot could get a stipulation if they required two shots to travel. She has nerve on back shoulder to side and back of arm to forearm to her thumb which is not spasming, but she knows that it is there which came on in the past week (2021). She was on Prednisone 40 mg for 5 days and she still had hives (though they are diminishing). The patient stated that she still has &#34;lizard skin&#34;. She received the shot on her right arm, but the hives spread on the left shoulder down the arm and forearm where she had shingles.

The outcome of the event hives was not recovered while the other events was unknown.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Feb2021 at age of 79-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; methylprednisolone (MEDROL, Tablet), orally from 20Feb2021  to 26Feb2021, at 4 mg, by mouth, frequency was different based on the day, from 27Feb2021  to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for swelling, the back. Medical history included thyroid and pericarditis fluid. Family history included brother had heart disease. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) ongoing for thyroid for 20 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 in left shoulder on 21Jan2021 (Batch/lot number: EN6201) for COVID-19 immunization with no side effects.  The patient had her 2nd Pfizer vaccine dose on 11Feb2021 and received a &#34;medrol pack&#34; on 20Feb2021 for &#34;shoulder, back and neck pain. She have felt lousy for 4 weeks. She went to the hospital with palpitations and it probably was from the 2nd pack of methylprednisolone, she was prescribed after the 1st pack did not really help her pain. She haven&#39;t been sick or had a cold for 25 years and the 2nd dose through her for a loop. She stated her daughter called her and she said that her doctor told her that her vaccine may not be effective and she may not be protected because she took methylprednisolone. The patient received the second vaccine on 11Feb2021 and she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling. The patient mentioned she went to her doctor because after calling the COVID hotline they said they had cases where some of the vaccine had seeped into the lymph nodes. She was told to have her lymph nodes. No patient demographic details provided regarding those other patients who had the vaccine seep into lymph nodes. She went on to explain she went to the doctor, but the doctor said there were no problems with the lymph nodes. On 13Feb2021, she felt achy and fatigued, back discomfort. The lightheadedness occurred on 18Feb2021. The doctor gave her a high dose of the methylprednisolone 4mg pack for a week. 16 days later on 27Feb2021 it had not touched the discomfort in back, fatigue and lightheadedness and gave her another pack of methylprednisolone.  She also had heart palpitation, was sweaty and went to the Emergency Room. The patient mentioned she took a low dose of levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). She asked the doctor about the methylprednisolone being taken after the shot. The patient heard it diminished the effect of the shot, that she may not have as much protection. She had called the COVID hotline to address this issue and they said people who were on chronic steroid therapy had no problem as far as they know. The patient asked if she was protected because she had the methylprednisolone pack the first one within 9 days after shot and a second pack 16 days later. She took a low dose of generic levothyroxine sodium every day. She commented she was concerned with the drug interaction and wanted to make sure still protected. She was informed by individual who answered COVID hotline she felt like she was still protected because others have been on chronic steroid therapy.

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered on the left arm on 21Apr2021 13:12 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia (diagnosed more than 20 years ago), bladder cancer (diagnosed 13 years ago the first time, 8 reoccurrences and has been cancer free for 2 years, cancer free for 2 years), multi drug allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, diabetes, and obesity. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, levothyroxine, and oxazepam. No vaccines received within 2 weeks. In 12 minutes after the injection on 21Apr2021, while she was still sitting in the parking lot, patient developed tachycardia on and extreme flushing to face and neck on 13:20.  They were as red as being in the sun.  She was aware of tachycardia first.  Then she looked in the mirror and was glowing red. Patient was observing in parking lot and took her pulse and it was 145. Persistent head to toe macular erythematous rash occurred next.  They took her to the ER about 20 minutes after the injection. In the ER, she was given 25mg of Benadryl IV and 125 mg of Solumedrol IV.  When both of those wore off the next day, the generalized rash came back on Thursday (22Apr2021).  The rash was persistent but not as flushed looking as before. When they got her into ER, the first blood pressure reading was 198/117, which was within 20 minutes of injection. Hypertension was experienced on 13:30. Her blood pressure usually was fairly low and was back to normal now. She had one reading of 124/76 to 170/something. Her normal range is anywhere between 150-170/70-80&#39;s. She is on Lisinopril. The other morning when it was 124/76, was just a fluke. That was an unusually good reading. They did a regular panel of lab work when she went to the ER. They did not tell her that anything was abnormal.  She asked them to run an A1C, but they told her they could not. They did a chest film, EKG, placed IV to give medications, but no fluids given. Her doctor said not to get second dose of the vaccine.  She had it at the hospital and they had reports of other people with a rash. The patient considered the events tachycardia, extreme flushing, macular erythematous rash and hypertension were medically significant while for headache was non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were possibly causally related to the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to plausible temporal relationship.  This case will be reassessed should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 80-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via unspecified route of administration, on right arm, on 14Jan2021 15:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination Facility type was at Health department gave it at the fairgrounds. Medical history included ongoing COPD, blood pressure high, GERD, former smoker she quit 30 years ago, had COVID while she was in a rehab center in Aug2020, for which she said it felt like bronchitis; broke her hip last August (Aug2020). Ongoing concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide, telmisartan (TELMISARTAN HCTZ) for blood pressure high, pantoprazole for GERD, vitamins, ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), zinc, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), magnesium. On 15Jan2021, patient had a 101F fever, a headache and chills all day. Her concern was that she had never had any kind of reaction to any kind of vaccine before. From what she&#39;s heard, people have had a worse reaction to the 2nd shot, and since the first shot was so bad she was worried about getting the 2nd one. She was scheduled for her 2nd dose on 02Feb2021, and she had an appointment scheduled with a specialist on 03Feb2021. The morning after getting the vaccine, she woke up and got dressed but kept thinking that she was cold so she put on an extra sweater. Stated that even with the extra sweater on, she still had the chills, then she started to get the headache, and then she took her temperature. Stated that she had also had a sore arm, it&#39;s finally starting to feel better today. The outcome of event sore arm was resolving, outcome of other events were resolved on 16Jan2021.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and previously took the flu shot one time and started having right arm pain across her chest over to the left side right after getting it. So she don&#39;t take it anymore and takes a bunch of herbs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she has a disease, amyloidosis on an unspecified date, where there is a build up of protein in the body. She didn&#39;t know that there is protein in the shot and doesn&#39;t know the affects it has with her condition. She found out the day after getting the first Pfizer C-19 (clarified as COVID-19) shot that there was protein in it. The patient wanted to know the affects it has with her condition and if it will affect her getting the second dose and if it covers the new virus and booster shot. The patient got the vaccine on 16Jan2021 and found out about the protein in it the next day when it came across her phone. The patient received it at a school, where they vaccinated 1,169 residents. They text her to inform her she could get the vaccine. They also have the health department there. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient took 1 Tylenol about 15:00 that afternoon and seated herself in the chair about 17:45, then she felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head. She stood up and walked around to see if she was going to faint and she did not faint. She walked through the house and nothing else happened. The patient mentioned that her eyes have been swollen and her hands hurt, that&#39;s where the protein build up comes in the body. Has pings up and down her legs, they are sharp pings that lasted through on to Tuesday. She took 1 Advil to help and as of yesterday (as reported) no pings. Her hands still hurt, because this condition forms chains in the body and the chains are around the hands like carpel tunnel. The protein normally should leave the body and with this condition it doesn&#39;t and it leaves chains. When she was diagnosed with it they took a spot off the ankle to test it, the Dermatologist did and sent it off. No further details provided. Wants to know the affects of her getting the second shot. No further details provided. The outcome of the events amyloidosis and hands hurt was not recovered, the events felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head and sharp pings up and down legs was recovering, and the event  eyes swollen was unknown.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot: EL8982) intramuscular in right arm on 22Jan2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Gastroparesis from 2016 and ongoing, ongoing Osteoarthritis (diagnosed about 10 to 20 years before), acid reflux (esophageal), blood pressure, osteoporosis, arthritis, anxiety, high cholesterol, stomach problems, allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, leg cramps at night, allergic to all kind of bites. Patient previously took shingles vaccine as immunization and she had had a small reaction, she had a patch of shingles break out around her arm at the site of injection site. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for Gastroparesis, ongoing erythromycin, ongoing aluminum hydroxide/magnesium carbonate (GAVISCON) for acid reflux (esophageal), ongoing calcium for Osteoporosis, ongoing losartan for Blood pressure, ongoing acetaminophen for arthritis, ongoing spironolactone as diuretic, ongoing tramadol for Osteoarthritis, vitamin C [ascorbic acid] as general supplementation, ongoing alprazolam for Anxiety, ongoing doxazosin for high blood pressure, ongoing fenofibrate for High cholesterol, ongoing vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX) as general supplementation, ongoing bisoprolol for high blood pressure, ongoing magnesium good for heart recommended by cardiologist, ongoing biotin for hair and nails, ongoing zinc as immunity booster, ongoing montelukast sodium for allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, ongoing levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) for allergies, ongoing cyclobenzaprine for leg cramps at night as muscle relaxer, ongoing macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) as laxative and ongoing &#34;CVS brand multivitamin at one tablet once a day oral as general supplementation&#34; (as reported).The patient experienced face felt hot and flushed and face red on 24Jan2021; gray spot on forehead on 25Jan2021; was tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot, face was burning and burned bright red face feeling sunburned in Jan2021.Events were described as follows: patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and she had a few mild symptoms. She did not feel really good for a day or two but it was nothing that alarmed her, she was tired and wiped out. She always took a shower since she had arthritis and it get gets her joints going. On 24Jan2021 after she got out of the shower, her face felt hot and it was red. She didn&#39;t think too much about it and it went away pretty soon. She did not connect it with the vaccine. On 25Jan2021 she took a little longer shower and the same thing happened, but it was 10 or 12 times worse in regards to her face feeling hot and was red. She was drying off and getting dressed and reported her face felt funny and it was really hot. When she looked at it was bright red like she had the worst sunburn, it felt like a sunburn. Her face was red and eyes were red bloodshot and it lasted about half an hour; her face got real flushed like a real bright sunburn and her face was burning and burned bright red. She started putting on cold wet wash cloths to help cool her face down and when it the wash cloths got warm, she would wet it again to cool her face down some more. She was alarmed but about 30 minutes later it started lightening up a bit and pretty soon it was back to normal. Her face felt different in the afternoon, it was a little red. She worked out in yard and last summer she got an insect bite on her forehead that turned gray, it was the size of silver dollar. After the hot flush thing this morning, that gray spot came back. Her doctor said it might take a while for it to go away. Her face felt warm like it has been sunburned. Her throat was dry since she has been waiting on the phone for an hour. Her face feeling sunburned/hot was about 95% gone, barely there. Her face getting red started on 24Jan2021 morning and it was almost gone. Treatment included ponds face cream and it was very soothing. Patient just wanted to know what to do about this flushing of her face and if it was dangerous what she can  do. She would like to know if she should be worried about this, it only happened when she took a shower. She was asking if there was anything she can do before she can get the second injection, so it does not happen again or what to do if it does happen again. Final outcome of tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot and face was burning and burned bright red/her face feeling sunburned/ face got really like the worst sunburn was unknown; outcome of the other events was not recovered.

                                                I am reporting that I was diagnosed with  shingles after 2 wks of getting my 1st dose of Covid vaccine shot in my upper left arm.  My arm starting hurting &amp; a few days later, I broke out with tiny dark red spots inside a red swollen circle.  Arm remained with a burning aching pain. My dermatologist said it was definately shingles &amp; prescribed a 10 day treatment of antiviral medication.  She didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine but  should report this.   The shingles are just below the shot area.

                                                Asthma attack began about 20 minutes after injection, with throat tightening, slight mouth swelling sensation and immediate wheezing which grew progressively worse.  I had my inhalers (Levalbuterol and Flovent) with me, used Levalbuterol at the direction of medical people who surrounded me after I reported wheezing.  They gave me a Benadryl, then brought a wheel chair and sent me directly to the ER.  I was there about 3 hours during which I had a heart monitor,  a &#34;breathing treatment&#34; by a respiratory therapist, and DUONEB, famotidine (PEPCID), and (DELTASONE). I was given a 3 day Rx for 20 mg. of prednisone, and released.  My lungs felt &#34;twitchy&#34; the next day and my voice was muted, but was well otherwise.   The only &#34;normal&#34; side effect I had was some soreness at the injection site for a couple of days, with some light sensitivity there for a few weeks.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EN6200) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies, hip surgery, and foot surgery three times. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. Patient reported she has been so sick. She got the shot on Monday 15Feb2021, and that same day she got so sick, it was horrible. Patient had chills, fever, aches and pains, and if someone named it, it was there. She stated that before Monday she was 183 pounds, didn&#39;t know if it has changed as she has not been on a scale, but she was sure it has because hasn&#39;t eaten since Monday, as she has had no appetite. Her appointment was at 07:45, and she went right when she got up, so she did not really have anything to eat on Monday. Patient stated that on Tuesday, she did not eat anything until the evening when she had one piece of pizza. Today, patient has only had a yogurt. Today was the first time she has gotten out of bed and even felt like getting dressed and putting her contacts in, since Monday. The last few days, patient stated that after getting up and going to the bathroom she would walk downstairs and felt weak as a kitten (15Jan2021). Patient stated that she was at least 80% better, because she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door (Feb2021), and she was not a wimp, it was just horrible. Patient mentioned that she was on a lot of medicine, probably 10, but this was the first time she was receiving this vaccine. She stated that she was still having pain where the injection occurred (Feb2021), like when her shirt touches it, she can tell it was there. But patient stated that she had the nicest nurse and the injection itself did not hurt, it was just later, and the injection site got swollen (Feb2021). Outcome of the event she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door, chills, fever, aches and pains, felt weak as a kitten was recovering; no appetite was not recovered; while the other events was unknown.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on her left arm on 30Jan2021 to 30Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin sodium (DILANTIN) and carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) and experienced allergy as her reaction to those were sometime between 2010 and 2012. On 30Jan2021 after three and a half hours, the patient felt sensation at her foot for that she could not walk, experienced chills, hands were shaking, had a swollen ankle and foot and pain. Around 5 o clock, the patient stated that it was like a strange sensation in her foot and she also got chills. By 7 o clock, she was in pain. The patient stated that she took two Tylenol. The patient stated that at around 9 o clock, she noticed that her ankle and foot were swollen with red blotches on it so she took two Benadryl and then slept until noon. The patient stated that Benadryl actually gave her some relief, although the pain didn&#39;t completely subside, but it subsided a little so that it was more tolerable. The patient stated that she had been debating if she should have gone to the emergency room (ER), but she didn&#39;t because she has a high pain tolerance. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9266 and expiry date 31May2021, via unspecified route of administration on 15Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included, broke her elbow from 04Dec2020 and surgery from 12Dec2019 and second surgery was from 15Jul2020; the patient thought that the second surgery on her arm was in 2020 and she actually broke her arm in 2019. She thinks it was actually Dec2019 when she broke her arm and the second surgery was on 15Jul2020; ongoing with the arm the pain and movement in that arm (movement disorder) and arm; weakened (same arm that she broke). There were no concomitant medications. The patient was taking the same medications she always takes, and she waited until after the dose to take them. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 lot number EL02162, expiry date 31May2021 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient was calling about the vaccine, the second Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She experienced some side effects, there was joint pain on 15Feb202 later that nigh and the most obvious thing was exhaustion that began later the same day as well; but one thing was unusual, the strange side effect that has happened on 16Feb2021 was that her hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy but it was much better now, it was the same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before. The patient stated that the main thing was the neuropathy thing, it felt like she was sitting on her hand and that persisted, but it was 90 percent better and she thinks it will go away. The neuropathy feeling was ongoing but much less, it was improved it happens only if she squeezes her hand so it was much less and she hoped it just dissipates. The patient&#39;s main concern was the neuropathy and it has improved a great deal. The patient mentioned with the arm the pain and movement in that arm has worsened since the injection (Feb2021). The worsened pain and movement has persisted about the same since she noticed it. The patient informed that was the joint she guessed, because she broke the elbow. The outcome of the events hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy, joint pain, exhaustion was recovering, same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before was unknown, while not recovered for the rest of the events.

The patient basically is maintained in the nursing home in this state of being bed-bound and nonverbal.  She was recently transferred to Rehab after she developed a stage IV sacral ulcer at a previous nursing home.  The patient had been seeing wound care and doing very well.  Her stage IV sacral ulcer had been healed to a stage II.  She had been gaining weight.  Unfortunately, at her wound care appointment yesterday the wound had decompensated a little bit and had started to drain some purulent material.  It also enlarged in size a little bit.  I was called yesterday afternoon and the nursing home reported the patient was not wanting to eat or drink.  Lab work showed a sodium of 170 and creatinine consistent with acute kidney injury.  She also appeared to have a urinary tract infection.  Because of her critical labs she was sent to the nursing home.  The patient was evaluated in the nursing home and then admitted to the floor.  She was given Zosyn and vancomycin and started on IV fluids.  The emergency room physician did counsel the family that the prognosis was very grim.  The patient has done reasonably well overnight.  She has been grimacing quite a bit and the family has decided they just want her kept comfortable    comfort care during admission

Then a day or two later started getting left arm rash then on to the right arm a few days later.  Don&#39;t know if rash was caused by that.  Went for 2nd shot today and rejected when I told them about fluctuation of temperatures at fist shot.  How can I get second shot??

An 80-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284) on left arm, intramuscular on 02Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pancreatic cancer stage IV metastasized, blood pressure (abnormal) and chemo. Concomitant medication included pancreatin (CREON) for pancreatic enzymes. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a side effect and it&#39;s so weird, she was a cancer patient she was in (city, state) and she had her first Covid vaccine on 12Jan2021 and she had her second one on 02Feb2021 and not a reaction until yesterday (06Feb2021) her left arm got a red rash, all the way up and down her shoulder to mid way between her elbow and hand and some swelling and she just wanted to make sure. She did look at the sheet and it does say you can get a rash, she has no temperature and she wanted to make sure that&#39;s a part of it all. When clarified if the retired registered nurse wanted to if it was the side effects from Covid vaccine, she stated, she guessed so because she got it on Tuesday and her arm hurt a little bit (Feb2021) but no rash showed up until yesterday which was Saturday. The patient had blood work done last Monday on 01Feb2021 with unknown results. The patient reported that she knows her white count was low (unspecified date) because they could give her chemo, so she actually has blood work on Monday 01Feb2021. Treatment was not received and patient stated, it just showed up yesterday and her nurse told her not to put anything on it. The outcome of the events was unknown.

They admitted me to Emergency because my blood pressure was extremely high-they said later it was about 187/ ?.  While I was there the blood pressure went up over 200 to 214/81.  I was dizzy and nausious and shaking because I became very cold even though the nurse covered me with 3 blankets.  After I left the hospital it took until after I got a prescription for meclizine filled and took one at 7PM before I was able to get the blood pressure down to a normal range - 130/64.  Today I am still taking meclizine as prescribed and am still slightly dizzy.  I do not know if this was related to the vaccine or not.

                                                sore right arm; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program. Contactable consumers (including the patient) reported that an 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EK4176, expiration date: Mar2021) intramuscular on the right arm on 21Jan2021 14:00 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. She had the first shot. She was going for the second shot on Thursday. She had a sore right arm on Jan2021, so she took ibuprofen (ADVIL) and she was hoping she did not ruin the fact that she had the first shot. The Advil took the soreness away and she has not had any problems since. The soreness started late in the evening when she went to bed around 11:30 or 12 and that was when she took Advil. The sore arm recovered the next day. She heard rumors from people that people should not take Advil or Tylenol after receiving the shot. She asks if this was true. She is asking if she can take Advil for her second dose. The events did not require a visit to physician office or Emergency Room. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a convention center. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the event was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

                                                minor hallucinations; metallic taste; horrible smell that she experiences in which it makes her not want to eat or drink; chills; joint pain; tissue tender; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  An 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid right on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as unknown, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter stated that since then (having both doses of the vaccine), she has been to the emergency room 4 different times experiencing side effects. She has a metallic taste and horrible smell that she experienced in which it made her not want to eat or drink. She has minor hallucinations, chills, joint pain, and her tissue is tender. Her joint pain has improved. Then stated, &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to die from it.&#34; She asked if anyone has reported these reactions previously and what should she do about them. Her family physician&#39;s nurse looked up a study in which 11% of the patients were experiencing a metallic taste. Also stated, &#34;This is very discouraging and depressing.&#34; The outcome of the event joint pain was recovering while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of minor hallucinations cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL8982) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20Jan2021 mid-afternoon at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation diagnosed about 25 years ago, Canker sore on 18Jan2021 (she did go the doctor for that and the doctor urged her to rinse it with salt water to she&#39;s been doing that), some soreness in her month on 18Jan2021, gout reaction. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. No Pfizer vaccine was administered on the same date. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. The patient got a reaction that she thought should be noted. She has had a very slight history of gout. She woke up this morning on 21Jan2021 and her big toes hurt. She knew that this was a symptom of what she had had in the past which was gout. The patient confirmed her big toes hurting was pretty much staying the same. It&#39;s not that uncomfortable. She knew from past experience that this was what happens, like when she ate certain foods like seafood or whatever, she would have this kind of gout reaction. This morning on 21Jan2021, she also felt the glands in her neck on the right side were swollen. The swelling seemed to have gone down. Her army was also very sore. She stated the soreness began last night, in the evening on 20Jan2021. The soreness had pretty much stayed the same. She expected the soreness, but she didn&#39;t expect her toes to hurt. It was important to note &#34;she is able to able the gout&#34;. She had only had gout really bad time once and then she&#39;s had a little bit every so often. The gout just seems to be connected to the vaccine- she could not say nothing that she ate would indicate other wise. The events did not require visit Emergency Room or Physician Office. She had an appointment for 10Feb2021 to get the second COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of event glands in her neck on the right side swollen was recovering, outcome of events was not recovered.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 21Jan2021 08:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included lymphoma from 2018. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer. The patient previously took rituxan for lymphoma (Reported she had been in remission for a little over a year. She said she had received only 4 Rituxan infusions for the lymphoma before she went into remission). 12 hours post injection: she &#34;experienced significant rigors and shaking, muscle and joint aches, her equilibrium was off at some point, she was tired, had generalized pain, and chills&#34;. She also confirmed feeling better.  She stated she heard the the second dose of the vaccine caused more reaction than the first dose and would like to validate the information. She explained the first instance she experienced rigors was after a lymphoma treatment. She believed the rigors lasted &#34;12 hours&#34; but was not certain because she &#34;fell asleep and got warmed&#34;. The patient felt great all day on 21Jan2021 after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said almost exactly 12 hours later, she started to have rigors. She was shaking so hard that her hands and body were jerking. Her muscles and joints were hurting, her equilibrium was off, she ached all over, she had pain, felt tired, and she had chills. The rigors started first. She said she felt really cold at the same time, so she went to bed and covered up, trying to get warmed. She fell asleep for awhile, and then woke up and went to the bathroom. When she went to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, she stood up, and every bone and muscle in her body hurt. She said she was aching all over, and her equilibrium was off. She didn&#39;t feel like getting up, and finally went to sleep to get the rigors to stop. She felt cold all the time now, but the rest of her symptoms had improved. She said it seemed like the muscle in her right leg was still pretty sore. She said she recovered from the rigors completely. She had rigors once before when she had an infusion. She clarified the infusion was Rituxan. She said she had a reaction to her first treatment of Rituxan. She said she had rigors when the Rituxan infusion was first started. She was given a couple things (but she didn&#39;t know what those things were), and she stopped shaking. She said the infusion staff waited a few minutes and tried to restart the Rituxan infusion, but she would have rigors again. She said the infusion staff tried slowing down the Rituxan infusion rate, as well. She said the Rituxan infusion normally takes 2 hours, but after 8 hours, she had only got about 20% of the Rituxan infusion, before the Rituxan infusion was stopped. She stated she had 3 subsequent Rituxan infusions at later dates, and did not have any problems with those infusions. Her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine was administered high up in the muscle of her left arm, close to the shoulder joint. She said the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection didn&#39;t hurt, and her left arm never got sore. She said on 30Dec2020 she had lab work done for her oncologist. She went about every other month for blood work to make sure she was still in remission. She saw her oncologist on 06Jan2021, and her oncologist said her blood work looked pretty good and was better. She asked her oncologist about the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her oncologist said she definitely wanted her to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. Her next appointment with her oncologist was in Mar2021. She said she had been seeing her oncologist every month, but her oncologist this time, wanted to try seeing her after 2 months. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of events rigors, shaking was recovered in Jan2021. The outcome of events muscle and joint aches/her muscles hurt, equilibrium was off, aching all over, tired, bone and muscle in her body hurt, hands and body were jerking was recovering. The outcome of event feels cold was not recovered.

I went to an appointment with a gynecologist for an unrelated chronic issue . (inflamed hemorrhoids) She examined my rash at that time and diagnosed it as shingles. Since that appointment the blisters began drying up. I continue to have itching, burning, and nerve pain on my left buttock.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said &#34;my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down.&#34; The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated &#34;I am so allergic to medicine.&#34; She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was &#34;so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix.&#34; States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about &#34;2 pages long.&#34;  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to take the second dose and probably won&#39;t. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn&#39;t had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn&#39;t want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn&#39;t in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn&#39;t feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn&#39;t know about COVID but he hadn&#39;t heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn&#39;t feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn&#39;t know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn&#39;t think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200&#39;s for underactive thyroid, it&#39;s minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn&#39;t have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won&#39;t take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?  The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events heart was &#39;beating out of chest&#39;, &#39;head and ears closed down&#39; was recovered in Jan2021, of other events was unknown.

I couldn&#39;t turn over to the left or right when down because of the pain. It was not shortness of breath. It was pretty bad. This pain lasted about 3 weeks.  Soreness is my arm appeared the day of vaccination but that went away within 2 days.  I also kept sneezing non stop, and my nose was runny this also started about 48 hours after vaccination. It is better but not completely gone yet. The sneezing is not constant, as of today but still there.

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; manufacturer reported as Pfizer-Wyeth; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 21Jan2021 12:30 at 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis in back; always had diarrhea because she had cancer and is unable to control her bowels. They tell her she has a lot of fiber in her food; but she can&#39;t control it; if she eats vegetables then she knows what&#39;s happening; but she always tries to take Imodium A-D before eating vegetables. She mentioned to them if she did not eat vegetables all she could eat is meat and cheese; doctor told her she was borderline diabetic, so she has wanted to keep up with that. The doctor was not worried about it; ongoing acid reflux; pain; and ongoing high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for acid reflux, ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis in back, caffeine, codeine phosphate, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE) for pain, loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM A-D) for diarrhea. The patient has not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinations reported as she has gotten flu shots and pneumonia shot and has never had any adverse events, reactions or problems with those; nothing. The reporter mentioned that she got her first dose of the vaccine in a clinic on 21Jan2021 and aware that the second dose will be on 16Feb2021. The patient reported that she felt bad after taking the first dose-flu like symptoms on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and had high fever Saturday (23Jan2021), urine became yellowish-brown and wants to know more information. The patient guesses she is having an allergic reaction on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and asked for further information about the allergic reaction relative to the vaccine. On Saturday (23Jan2021), she was feeling good. She got up, went to store, came back and had little diarrhea symptoms then she began to get sick, feverish. She added that then the vomiting, then achy like flu symptoms. She still feels feverish, she has a really bitter taste, or no taste in her mouth really but it&#39;s going away. To her it seems like the worst part is over. She almost called 911 but then did not want to go the hospital because of all the people with COVID in the hospital. The next day on 24Jan2021, when she woke up, she was not as fevered. She can check her own self with her hand and it was like she put her hand on a stove. She went to sleep and the next morning (24Jan2021), she was not as feverish; her mouth still has that nasty, old bitter taste that does not go away with brushed teeth. She feels better today (unspecified date). She mentioned that the second dose is scheduled to be administered 16Feb2021, but she really does not want to go get that if she feels like this. She had blood work for her sugar done on 21Jan2021 because she is borderline diabetic, but results are unknown, have not had any results yet. The outcome of the events was recovering.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 15:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included wrist had arthritis (pain). There were no concomitant medications. Patient height was a little less than 5. She used to be over 5 but she shrunk. Her weight used to be at 226 lbs, it came up to 230. This year (2021) it went up because, its her, she ate too much and she did not obey the rules.

Last night (07Feb2021) she unable to sleep the whole night as a result of lots of pain in her wrist and hand but especially thumb/wrist on the right side. she also reported swelling in her hand and was hardly able to bend her fingers. She tried to bend her fingers and she can but her wrist was swollen, it was less right now but she still had the pain. She applied muscle relaxant (unclear if topical) and took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and massaged her hand with warm water and then for the second time she used the muscle relaxation. She hadn&#39;t taken paracetamol yet she was waiting 4 hours but the pain was still there, it was a little bit less. Not sure if it her arthritis or side effects from vaccine but believes it was from the vaccine. Stated she used to have the same problem with her wrist arthritis (pain). Also reported that she experienced additional side effects on 08Feb2021 which lasted about 5 minutes then went away: blurry eyes; wanting to faint; dizziness, sweating (whole body started to be like sweaty). Asking for information on muscle and joint pain after the vaccine and recommendations on what to do. So far she didn&#39;t know what it was, and if it was a side effect of the arthritis, because once in a while that happens but when it happened it went away right away but this time her wrist pain was there still there. Patient sat down and now she was stretching her leg, she sat down on the chair and its gone she had no more problems. Patient said her right hand, she was very slow writing. She said at least she can write her hand was going back to a routine but she was in a lot of pain. Outcome of event wanting to faint/dizziness, blurry eyes, sweating was recovered on 08Feb2021, and outcome of other events was unknown.

Within minutes, my left thump had spasms and painful cramping and &#34;froze&#34; I massaged my thump for about 5 minutes and the pain subsided.  I then had painful cramping in my left calf and then the entire leg which then followed by Muscle pain and cramping in both legs.  I was told that I should exercise, so I went for a long walk.  When I returned home, i felt even worse so I went back to bed. Headaches began.

                                                She is experiencing an Allergic reaction, rash; little coughing spell; Itching eyes/My eyes started itching; Multiple hives all around her right eye; Wheezing; didn&#39;t feel comfortable; her upper lip became puffy/bottom lip began to swell; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient) via Medical Information Team. An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN6201), intramuscular at upper left arm on 21Feb2021 at 08:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included seasonal asthma, allergy to class A antihistamines that started in her 20s, facial &amp; peripheral edema, blood pressure abnormal, and celiac disease. The patient had known allergy to Benadryl and when she takes it she gets peripheral and facial edema, lip swelling, top and bottom, hives around her whole right eye. The patient also has an allergy to Class A antihistamines that started in her 20s. She said the allergy started with Seldane &amp; Claritin. She said she had giant hives with Claritin. She said she was told there were 2 classes of antihistamines &amp; she couldn&#39;t use the Class A antihistamines. She said she previously reported her Seldane, Claritin &amp; Benadryl allergies, saying she has facial &amp; peripheral edema. She said she only uses the Class B antihistamine Cimetidine now. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, omeprazole, and pravastatin. On an unspecified date, the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction, rash. On 21Feb2021, the patient experienced &#34;her upper lip became puffy/bottom lip began to swell,&#34; multiple hives all around her right eye, wheezing, and didn&#39;t feel comfortable. On 21Feb2021 at 14:00 (reported as about 2PM), the patient experienced &#34;Itching eyes/My eyes started itching.&#34; On 21Feb2021 at 21:00 (reported as 9PM), the patient experienced little coughing spell. The reporter considered the events swelling lips, itching eyes, multiple hives all around her right eye, and wheezing as serious medically significant. The patient further reported that she felt fine after the shot, her arm was not sore, nothing. She said her arm was fine, and she had no problems, whatsoever, after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has had some weird allergic reactions in the past, but no anaphylaxis. About 12:00 to 12:30 PM (also reported as around midday), the patient&#39;s lip felt puffy. She said she had ate an apple and thought maybe something was on the skin of the apple. She said then her bottom lip began to swell, so she took 3 Cimetidine (NDC Number: 49035-820-72, lot number: 9AE2576A, expiry date: Dec2020). The patient stated that she was allergic to what she believe are class A antihistamines as they gave her facial and peripheral edema including Benadryl and everything on the list. About 2PM, the patient&#39;s eyes felt itchy, she took allergy eye drops (eye drops seasonal relief with tetrahydrozoline HCL 0.05% and zinc sulfate 0.25%. She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient&#39;s lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler. She said she has been using the Serevent Diskus Inhaler for seasonal allergies for years and the inhaler works. She said she occasionally uses the Serevent Diskus for colds during the winter. She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus. NDC Number: 0173-0521-00, Lot Number: VV3E, Expiration Date: Sep2021) and Flovent (Flovent HFA 110mcg Inhaler, NDC Number: 0170719-20, Lot Number: C47A, Expiration Date: Jul2021). That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she&#39;s doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient&#39;s big concern was that she probably shouldn&#39;t get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

                                                No side effects in 30 minute waiting period and none on day of injection--some mild itching began night of injection. Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E73246, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 14:15 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cardiac pacemaker insertion, high blood pressure for years. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS). The patient previously took flu shot (FLU VACCINE II) and never had a reaction to the flu shot, macrodantin and experienced drug hypersensitivity and hives. It was reported that about 15:15, injection site felt like it was on fire and then the whole arm felt like it was on fire. The patient got concerned. Her throat felt like it was going to close. Symptoms got less severe. She was fine yesterday and was fine that day. She called her doctor and was advised to put cold compresses on the arm and take Tylenol. She was ok. She read an article that stated if a person had a reaction to not have the second shot. She did not know if her reaction is severe. The second shot is due around 27Jan2021. She wanted to know what to do.  She felt fine on the day of report and was fine 2-3 hours after the onset of the hot and fiery feeling. It was scary and she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She also added that around 15:15, the injection arm felt like it was on fire. She felt flushed. Her throat felt like it would close up but never did. Everything resolved 2-3 hours after it started. Clinical outcome of the events was recovered on 06Jan2021.

An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on14Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis on clavicle, thorax and lumbar. The patient had concomitant medications (unspecified). The patient wanted to report the reactions occurred on 14Jan2021 for the vaccine she got; she got a headache, couple of hours later, her neck was hurting. So, she asked somebody that was with her to check and told her that it was swollen. She also had dryness, felt it on lips. The patient touched her neck and it hurts. It did hurt and it was swollen, the neck. They gave her Tylenol and Benadryl. So, it does help her sleep but the next day, she was not so much hurting. Just had headache. On 17Jan2021, when she touched the back of her ear, it was tender and very sore. It was not as bad as it was. The first day (14Jan2021), she was feeling very tender on the gland. Those were not swollen. Lymphatic glands, those were the ones that got swollen on 14Jan2021. She would like you to know the main cause, they looked and told her it is normal for the lymphatic glands to get swollen after the vaccine. So, the patient guessed that is what she got but she still had a lot of soreness in the back of her neck. Outcome of the event events headache and neck pain was not recovered while unknown for other events.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

When I woke up  around 8:30 could feel some.   During day some little ones mostly arms or hands, once in a while legs,  Monday 1/23 around 9:00 PM a hard jerk on left shoulder and at night kind of a hard one on left arm.   Seemed to have seattled down to mostly subtle ones in hands or arms on and off.  Legs feel kind of stiff or tight.    Once in awhile felt pulsating through out, but that seems to have gone away.  Mild pain feeling around shoulder blades on and mostly off.  Never had before.

                                                ache on her left arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer via a Pfizer-sponsored program. An 82-year-old female patient received their first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9262, expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included breast cancer from 01Dec2020 to an unknown date.  Concomitant medication included simvastatin and lisinopril. It was reported that she got her first dose on 23Jan2021 and she got an ache on her left arm and then she was originally scheduled for second dose on 13Feb2021, however though, she was rescheduled to have the second dose on 9Feb2021, that is 17 days earlier and she is worried about it and matter of fact is she will have an surgery of breast lumpectomy on 11Feb2021. So, her concern is if she can second dose early and or if it&#39;s okay to have the surgery prior the vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included weight: about 200 pounds (overweight) on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                Got her vaccine, came home drove herself, had no problem whatsoever, felt perfectly fine during the day.  She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

An 82-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 82 years old. Medical history included history of a stroke from an unknown date (previous history of a stroke 19 months ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2(Lot# EW5318) on 07Feb2021, at 82 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event (no reaction). Other historical vaccine included Flu shot (influenza vaccine) on an unspecified date and experienced almost killed her. The patient reported no reaction and no problems (no pain, no nausea, no anything) from the second dose until the evening of 08Mar2021 when she was in her kitchen cooking and chopping vegetables, she felt the sudden urge to faint and then became so dizzy that she had to lie down on the couch. She had an overwhelming feeling of dizziness. A feeling like she wanted to faint, and she never faints. Her daughter got her to the sofa. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. The room spun unbelievably. Everything spun. She went to bed and when she woke up, she felt worse. She states that the dizziness was worse, she was unable to visually focus, if she closed her eyes and she opened one eye it would be blurry and the people on TV were sliding off the screen and  everything was sliding away, and she had pain behind her left eye into her head. When she tried to get up to go to the bathroom the room was spinning. It lasted through the next day (09Mar2021). When she got up, she couldn&#39;t put her two feet on the floor out of bed without leaning towards the left. She didn&#39;t fall. It was so bad she had to grab onto things to walk.  During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on Mar2021 which included blood pressure, triglyceride, fluids or liquids: tested perfect; and CAT scan, EKG had unknown results. On 11Mar2021, CT Scan: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem); MRI: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem).

                                                Two days after vaccine I started with pain in my jaw joint down my neck into both arms that lasted 2 minutes, then it came back in a couple hours and now it&#39;s still coming and going. It&#39;s more in my right arm and I cannot lift my arm when it&#39;s happening and it leaves me weak, trembling and in a cold sweat and sometimes I&#39;m real hot. In February I went to the hospital and 4 doctors looked at me, I stayed there one day overnight .  I kind of think that I was given the whole vial of the vaccine and want to know how long will it take for it to wear off, I watched them draw up the vaccine and they gave me everything in the vial. I think I got the whole vial.

                                                My mom received the Covid 19 vaccine on Jan 5, 2021 and became very about a week later. I was informed that she tested positive for Covid 19 on January 14th. One January 17th she became very tired and weak and would not eat. Hospice called me and told me that she was in a decline state. I saw her on January 25 and 26 and she was just sleeping and could not open her eyes. Her vitals were good and she seemed to understand when I talked to her - she would squeeze my hand and moan but she could not talk or open her eyes. My mom passed away on January 27, 2021 just 22 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She was very think to begin with and being to weak and tired  to eat resulted in her losing even more weight. Some of the other residents were given fluids to help and they recovered. My mom was not given fluids. I believe there were 20 deaths in her care home for the month of January when they vaccinated. This was an alarming number of deaths for the home. The facility had very few Covid deaths in 2019 and 2020. I asked every week if they had any Covid and or Covid deaths and this amount was shocking to me and the workers there.

My legs are still killing me, I have an appointment with my Cardiologist and Rheumatologist, I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. My question is , the doctor didn&#39;t know if it was from the cookie or from the vaccine.  I am wondering if I should get the second vaccine.&#34; She stated she never had a sore arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she did something stupid after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has rheumatoid arthritis, and has had terrible leg pain for a long time. She said her friend talked her into having a cookie that had marijuana in it. She said her leg pain was so severe at the time, she took the cookie with marijuana in it around 4:30PM-5:30PM on 17Feb2021. She said at 7:00PM she was bouncing off the wall (clarified as unsteady, and going from side-to-side when she tried to walk), her head was pounding, her heart was pounding, she was dizzy and shaky. She said she went to the hospital emergency room. She said the hospital kept her overnight because her oxygen saturation level kept dropping. She said she got home from the hospital last night (18Feb2021), clarifying she was discharged from the hospital at 6:00PM. She said she noticed her mouth was very dry when she went to the hospital on 17Feb2021, and her mouth continued to stay very dry all night. Caller asked if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after experiencing what she did after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine. Reported her leg pain became severe about a month ago, clarifying she has had leg pain for a long time. Reported her blood pressure was up while she was at the hospital, clarifying she had one blood pressure reading of 145/82 that she recalls. She said her blood pressure is pretty normal, and she takes blood pressure medications. She said she believes her heart rate was up too, but was unsure what her heart rate was. Reported a couple days before receiving her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine, she went to her doctor on 12Feb2021 because she was having severe chest pain. She said her doctor did an EKG and told her she had a right bundle branch block. She said her doctor sent her to the hospital Emergency Room. She said while she was in the Emergency Room she had an extremely high blood pressure of 245/105. She said she came home from the Emergency Room on 12Feb2021, and had a couple spells, but was OK. She said she was OK when she went to get her first COVID-19 Vaccine shot on Wednesday, 17Feb2021. Reported she had difficulty reading her COVID-19 Vaccine Immunization Card. She said the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Lot Number looked like EN6200, and there was no NDC Number, or Expiration Date listed on the card. Reported she had blood work done at the hospital. No further details provided. Treatment included she was given Albuterol breathing treatments while in the hospital, along with some other things that she can&#39;t remember. Reported she believes her symptoms were medically significant because she was nervous from recently being to the Emergency Room for her severe chest pain a few days before. Reported she did not think her symptoms were from the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she thought the cookie with marijuana in it caused her symptoms because the symptoms happened about 1-1/2 to 2 hours after she had the cookie with marijuana in it. Reported she feels very weak and tired. Reported yesterday (18Feb2021) while she was in the hospital, her head felt like it was going to explode when the hospital staff tried walking her around. She said she asked the hospital staff to check her blood pressure because her head will feel like that when her blood pressure is up. She said when the hospital staff checked her blood pressure, her blood pressure was elevated. Reported the pain in her legs is driving her crazy, so she called for an appointment with an orthopedist today. Reported she is feeling better, but is still experiencing a tightness in her throat. She clarified she felt the throat tightness on Wednesday, 17Feb2021. She said she has no problem swallowing or eating, but her throat feels tight. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. AE(s) required a visit to: Emergency Room (admitted to hospital), no Physician Office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 83-year-old female patient had medical history included rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia and carotid endarterectomy, and was on multiple concomitant drugs.  Considering temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the onset of the reported events, cannot be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She does have rosacea but this was worse.  After she got home she began to feel her heart beating rapidly.  She had taken her medications, but about 6:00 PM she took an extra dose of Metoprolol and waited until about 8:00 PM and the rapid heart beat was still there.  Her son took her BP and it was extremely high and it was 119/68, pulse 112.   At 11:00 her BP was 108/59 with a pulse of 78.   She was able to sleep but did feel heaviness the day later and rapid beating had subsided.   She is still having the rosacea, tingling, stinging of her face.  Her vaccine site was not even sore and he no problems with that.  She called her doctor and the nurse called her back, and she has been trying to call the place where she got the vaccine.  She was told to make sure what to do before she gets the 2nd shot.   She has recovered from the rapid heart beat episode, but the skin stinging of her face is still ongoing.

She had felt well and had been in her usual state of health, and was able to cook and enjoy a turkey dinner with 5 individuals on 03/07/21, but on 03/08/21 she began to develop progressive generalized weakness up to the point where she remained in bed for several days.  She could not support herself when attempting to rise from bed.  She noted poor PO intake with nausea, no vomiting.  Loose stools for several days, no noted stool blood.  Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.  She was unable to elaborate regarding the falls but admitted to hitting her head at least once, unable to say if she lost consciousness or if she felt presyncopal symptoms before falling.  She had initially presented on 03/12/21 to ED for evaluation, workup negative, labs and imaging normal.  CT brain found no acute process.  She was sent home with arrangements for home PT.  She returned to ED 03/15/21 when symptoms had not improved.  In the ED she was found to be afebrile, significantly hypertensive, mildly tachycardic, &#43; orthostatic vital signs.  Labs significant for heme occult positive stool, proBNP 397, WBC 10.1, H/H 13.4/39.9, PLT 493, UA neg for infection.  COVID neg.  CXR found slightly increased interstitial markings.  MRI brain found no acute intracranial abnormality.  She was evaluated by PT and found to be unsafe to DC home as she could not ambulate without leaning backward and to the right and needed 1-2 assist.  She was admitted to HM service for further management.  She has remained consistently afebrile.  She continues to experience significant gait instability, cognitive slowing, and difficulty with finger-to-nose testing with noted dysmetria, no focal weakness.

An 83-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Feb2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included right partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the remote past, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, morbid obesity, motion sickness, unspecified allergy as the patient cannot tolerate anything but paracetamol (TYLENOL), acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL) tablet, meclizine hcl tablet for motion relief and hydrochlorothiazide/ triamterene (DYAZIDE) capsule. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247) on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) in the left arm and experienced difficulty breathing, ground glass opaque lung problem, weak, nausea, &#34;pain on rt.side waist around to back, down to lower belly&#34;, slight temp almost 100. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath and inability to eat for two days. The patient reportedly received the second dose of BNT162B2 four days prior to coming to the emergency room (ER). In the ER, the patient reported severe asthenia, mild upper abdominal pain and dysphagia, all as of an unspecified date. The patient underwent a CTA in the ER, on Feb2021, which showed no acute pulmonary embolism, or no ground glass infiltrates. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 21Feb2021 at 17:51 for management of worsening shortness of breath. Due to the patient&#39;s acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema and obesity, hypoventilation (as of an unspecified date in Feb2021) was further complicated by obstructive sleep apnea, thus, the patient was admitted to &#34;MedSurg&#34;. The patient did not present with COVID-19 or COPD. The BMP was 226 at the time of admission. The patient was started on supplemental oxygen and additionally started on CPAP at night. She was seen by a pulmonologist who recommended Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR). Pulmonology also recommended to work-up any underlying unaddressed coronary artery disease contributing to the patient&#39;s shortness of breath. The patient underwent an echocardiogram on Feb2021 with regadenoson (LEXISCAN) for her shortness of breath which was within normal limits. As the patient additionally reported dysphagia at the time of admission, she was evaluated by a speech and swallow evaluation specialist as well as a gastroenterologist. A GI swallow series was recommended which the patient underwent on Feb2021 and was found to have no active signs of oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. The patient additionally underwent a physical exam on 24Feb2021 at 08:00 with the following results. Vital signs: Temp: 98.2, Pulse: 69, Resp: 17, B/P (MAP): 98/62 (74), Pulse Ox: 96, O2 Delivery: Nasal cannula, O2 flow rate:2.00.

An 83 years old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at age of 83 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hip surgery a few months ago and she was still kind of stiff and sore. Concomitant medications included lisinopril at low dose 10 mg once daily taken for blood pressure abnormal about 10 years ago; clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for transient ischaemic attack from 2012 (she believed it was a around that time); acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN LOW) at low dose (she began taking this before the Lisinopril so it has been several years).The patient mentioned that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and everything was fine that day and the day after. At late in the day on 04Mar2021, she experienced a lot of problems which she mentioned was the worst experience in her life. She was 99% sure it was from the vaccine because she didn&#39;t experience anything like that before getting the vaccine. She mentioned that she experienced side effects all night like her heart beating really fast, a headache, a stiff neck, her nerves pounding all throughout her body, and a blood pressure of 174/78. She mentioned that it was the worst she&#39;s felt so far as compared to going to the ER, as she&#39;s experienced before. She did not go to the ER as she could not drive herself and she was living alone. She mentioned that she better the next day although it was not totally gone, she was a little shake and kind of weak. As of calling, she said that she was feeling okay and better than yesterday (07Mar2021) in which the effects were still present. She mentioned that it was horrible, very scary, she was very ill, very uncomfortable, really bad, and didn&#39;t want to go through that again. She didn&#39;t know if she would make it through the night. She was asking for what to do and asking if there needed to be an adjustment for her dose because she was a very small person. She didn&#39;t want to have the 2nd shot if she went through that again. It was the worst experience of her life. She was not sure what to do now about her second shot. She had the first shot 02Mar2021 and everything was fine, 03Mar2021 she was okay but on 04Mar2021 she had, by night time, she had a lot of scary things that had never happened to her before. Her heart was pounding she could hear it in her ears. Her head, her neck felt stiff and her head felt heavy, her whole body felt heavy and like the nerves in her whole body were just aggravated, it was hard to explain. She had ringing in her ears. Her blood pressure was 174/78 and she was just afraid to have the second shot, it was scary, it was really bad. She was wondering if the amount of the vaccine was too much for her.  She confirmed it was the evening 04Mar2021 when all this began. She said all of this was pretty well recovered at this point. She said the day after that happened, she was shaky but today (08Mar2021) she was fine. She did not know what it would be medications they are looking for but she was on normal medicine for old people she guesses. This was so bad that she really was not going to take the second dose unless they can tell her if she should or that they should give her less or something like that. The outcome of events was recovered in Mar2021.

An 83-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 28Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported: did not get a card that lists NDC, Lot, Expiration) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. It was also reported that no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient did not require visit to Emergency Room and stated that she was desperate and would&#39;ve gone but she didn&#39;t have a ride and added she is worried about the second. Also, the patient did not required visit to the physician&#39;s office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine and 5 days later she got a terrible reaction. She did not expect it. She had a terrible reaction and thought she was going to die. She stated she wanted to report this because the TV says you should expect some kind of reaction after the second dose but does not say after the first and she said that Pfizer needs to know about this reaction. She stated she heard the second dose is worse. The patient asked if she has to get her second dose and if she needs to report this anywhere else? The patient added &#34;what should I do about side effects?&#34; It was reported that the patient (reported as is almost 84) had the first shot on Sunday 28MAR2021 and everything was fine by Friday she was in terrible trouble really really bad. States she has never heard of this, they say the first is easy and everything was terrible. States every bone and every part of her body hurt on 02Apr2021. She states after 24 hours (03Apr2021) it did go away. The patient asks does this happen to other people? It was stated that her symptoms came on suddenly and she had a severe sore throat, stiff neck, back ache, pain under her ribs, very very weak and shaky, shortness of breath, biceps ached, fatigue, and a tremendous headache. It was stated that started on Friday 02Apr2021 12:00 like a hurricane and after 24 hours they subsided on Saturday 03Apr2021. The patient added that she doesn&#39;t remember getting a card and didn&#39;t know that she should have a card until she saw something about it on TV, and thought well she didn&#39;t get a card. The patient also asked what does she do about that?  The patient states she takes medication but not that affects this. The outcome of the events recovered on 03Apr2021.

On 06Mar2021, the patient began just feeling bad, was having like a terrible time, having a hard time, was really not feeling good; was more confused; lethargic; had trouble getting her up, was having to do everything for her, feed her, bathe her; couldn&#39;t walk and lost her appetite. On 09Mar2021, the patient was shutting down. On the same day at 18:30, the patient had gone in the bathroom and said it burned when she peed. So, the patient was taken to urgent care so it would not get out of hand.

They did a CT scan of the head and chest to look for stroke or seizure and there was nothing. They blamed it on her dementia that had suddenly progressed. The patient was hospitalized from 16Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. On 12Mar2021, the patient experienced cellulitis in her arm. The reporter clarified that the cellulitis was further down her arm, around her wrist hand area. Her wrist was huge, hot, red, and her hand was swollen.

A 84-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration in Jan2021 at single dose for vaccination. Dose injection to left deltoid around 14:00. Medical history included car wreck, hypertension, scoliosis. Concomitant medication included ongoing celecoxib (CELEBREX) for car wreck, amlodipine besilate, benazepril hydrochloride (AMLODIPINE/BENAZEPRIL) from 2017 and ongoing for anti-hypertension. The patient reported she had the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine a week ago and it did not really bother her until she started trying to do exercises of her arm. On 15Jan2021 she had a swollen lump that is quite sore on her left arm that did not go down and it had been 3 days now. She did not have a fever, the area was not red, it&#39;s just swollen. She just wanted to know if this event was customary with the product; and if her second dose should be given in a different anatomical location. It was just painful and swollen; had not been hospitalized for this event. She could see the difference, she was quite wrinkled now with age; but at the site of her swollen lump on left arm she had no wrinkles right now. Her second dose is scheduled for 02Feb2021 at 14:20. The outcome of events was not recovered.

An 84-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249) via intramuscular at arm left on 13Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for prevention because of age group. Medical history included hypothyroid diagnosed many years ago, having Covid in Jun2020. Concomitant medications were unknown. The patient was really sick from an unspecified date.

Her joints were aching at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021.  She had a fever and not really chills, but she just never could get warm and was really cold at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021. She went to bed and woke up on that same date, 13Jan2021, and it started at 11pm.  She guessed it was disabling.  As it went on, it got better. By Friday, she was finally able to eat. She has plenty of weight to fall back on for not eating. By Friday, she started eating again. She was still not back to normal yet though. She just felt like she could not get up. The fever only went on for a few days. Left arm was sore after injection and she had a lump and was itching 13Jan2021. It worried her.  The lump was still itching and sore, but was getting better. Reporter stated that the shingles vaccine did the exact same thing to her with the lump under her skin and itching.  It was given on her hip because she had small arm and they were scared to give it in her arm. The reporter wanted to know if there were elderly people in the trial and did any of them have COVID. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. Seriousness for In bed 2 days was reported as disabling. Seriousness for Could not eat, Fever and really cold was reported as not serious. Seriousness for Left arm sore after injection with lump and itching was reported as medically significant.

                                                I just got done going to the bathroom (2-4-2021) and was zipping up my pants  when I fainted.  I fell backwards into the bathtub  knocking down both shower doors.  My legs were hanging over the edge of the tub.  One shower door fell on my upper right chest area.   This happened just over 24 hours from when I received the vaccine.  I had not felt bad at all from the vaccine.  Didn&#39;t sleep too well that night (2-4-2021) because I hurt due to the fall.  I called my doctor on 2-5-2021 to let her know I fainted 24 hours after receiving the vaccine and wondered if that was due to it.  I do feel weak today (2-5-2021).

                                                Narrative: Patient with history advanced vascular dementia, hypertensive cerebrovascular disease and stroke, T2DM. Received her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 14:00 and was reported to have expired at home at 20:55. Dr. (Medical Director) spoke with patient&#39;s son/caregiver 2/4/21. Son reports that patient was in her usual health yesterday morning, deemed well enough by son to travel for vaccination. He reports she had no bothersome symptoms after either first or second vaccinations. Specifically denied rash, wheeze, and difficulty breathing. Son was with patient throughout the day. In the evening, when preparing for bed, he noted she became suddenly unresponsive in a similar fashion as she has done several times in past years. While in all previous such episodes she recovered within minutes, last evening she did not regain consciousness, experiences a brief period of labored breathing, and died. Patient&#39;s son called 911 and the patient&#39;s body was brought to the medical examiners. The medical examiner declined to proceed with autopsy. Patient&#39;s son is not interested in autopsy. Patient&#39;s son reports confidence that his mother&#39;s underlying hypertensive/diabetic cardiovascular disease is the natural cause of her death.

                                                Patient is a 84-year-old female presenting to the emergency room with anxiousness, generalized weakness and one episode of vomiting/nausea surrounding her Covid vaccination this afternoon.  On exam patient appears mildly anxious, has no evidence of allergic reaction, lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.  Patient is resting comfortably, speaking in complete sentences.  Shortly after physical exam patient was noted to have oxygen saturation of 90 to 92%, subsequently placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Will obtain CBC, CMP, chest x-ray, EKG.  We will also give patient 500 cc of fluid and 4 mg of Zofran for control of nausea and vomiting.  We will continue to monitor patient. No leukocytosis, no AKI, electrolytes within normal limits, chest x-ray without evidence of underlying pneumonia or pneumothorax.  I have reevaluated patient, patient has been reporting a ongoing headache for which she has a history of and takes Fioricet, requesting Fioricet.  Will order Fioricet.  We attempted to take patient off of her oxygen however when taken off the oxygen she drops to 88% on room air.  Patient reports ongoing generalized weakness and nausea which has required an additional 4 mg Zofran.  Given that patient has been monitored for couple of hours and has had ongoing nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness in the setting of hypoxia when taken off of oxygen will obtain troponins and admit patient to the hospital for obs.  I have spoken to Dr. who has accepted patient to observation with telemetry for further management.  Patient was informed of admission status, with no further questions at this time.

Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

An 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm on 21Jan2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included oral cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received flu vaccine for immunization and reported that it made her sick for 10 days 4 or 5 years ago. The patient previously took Tylenol (takes 1 instead of 2, Everything she takes half the recommended dose). The patient experienced fast heartbeat, increased BP, weakness, dizziness, nausea and headache on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was further reported that she had a fast heart beat, her blood pressure went real high, she was dizzy and weak. This was while she was there and being watched for the 15 minutes by a nurse. She is 84 years old and doesn&#39;t take any medication; she did have oral cancer but with no chemo as it had not spread and this was 2 years ago. It was explained that the patient didn&#39;t feel good about it but she drove home. When she got home she was confused and felt like she could pass out. She walked through the house didn&#39;t know who she was, she just kept walking and walking. It was a strange feeling that lasted 15-20 minutes. She called her son late in the afternoon and told him to check on her to make sure she made it through the night. She still had funny feelings over the next few days but at this point she only has the dizziness that happens occasionally. She notes also that her blood pressure was checked at home by her and was higher than normal the first few days after but is now normal. Over the next day she had a headache and a little nausea, but it was not severe. She also mentions having a little soreness in her arm but not bad. She did read about the side effects and states she had the elevated heart rate, increase in blood pressure and dizziness right after getting it. The patient wonders could she ask for smaller dose, she only weighs about 110lb. When she spoke with her doctor she was told that the COVID virus is worse than what she experienced after the vaccine. She has not been to the doctor since getting the vaccine, she just talked to them. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: high and heart rate: fast on Jan2021. The patient was recovering from dizziness, the outcome of nausea was unknown and the patient recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

That evening for both, I started aching a lot in both arms and shoulders, couldn&#39;t sleep and extremely tired the next day.  The following day I was back to normal and the symptoms gone.  The second shot had a little stronger symptoms. I had covid in early November, 2020 in case that matters.    Also, I had a flu shot late October and had a severe reaction which led to my being diagnosed with covid.

Benadryl was administered at 12:40 PM via IM in the Right Deltoid. At 12:45 PM pulse was 78, Respirations were 20, and BP was 118/84. At 12:50 PM pulse was 76, Respirations were 21 and BP was 140/90. At 12:55PM pulse was 72, Respirations were 19 and BP was 132/82.  Patient denied ambulance services. Stated that she felt better at this time. Monitored patient for a total of 30 minutes and stated she felt fine at that point. Patient was followed up with the next day. She stated that no more Benadryl was needed at home. She slept a few hours after and continued to have slight facial swelling that lasted for a couple of days. Patient is unsure if she wanted to get the 2nd dose, but wanted to keep her appointment for it still. Her doctor recommends getting the second vaccine dose and told her to just take Benadryl and Pepcid before the vaccine. We educated her about the possibility of getting that second dose at her doctor&#39;s office or at Hospital in order for her to have more immediate access to emergency care.

                                                She got the vaccine, she had no effects, and no reaction whatsoever. The husband had no side effects either.   On 3/16/21 they were on their way to go to bed and the bedroom is upstairs and she was fine, she was in the bedroom getting ready for bed, and her husband followed 15 minutes later and when he got upstairs she was sitting in a chair next to the bed, and he noticed that when he spoke with her that she did not speak clearly back, and was very low tone, not much loudness to her speech.  He didn&#39;t think much about it, and he talked with her again and noticed that she seemed to be having some difficulty talking, but he could understand what she was saying if he paid close attention.  He then realized that something was wrong, and asked her how she felt and she said she felt strange.  She was trying to take a pair of socks off and could not reach them.  She tried to lift her leg to put one knee over the other for her to remove them and was not able to do that.  He helped her take the socks off, she wanted to put some cream on her foot and was not able to do so, which is her usual routine.  He put that on her foot while he was talking to her, and her speech was different than it was earlier.  She was wearing a turtle neck shirt and was not able to take it off to get dressed for bed.  Her husband assisted in dressing her to get ready for bed.  He was thinking that she may have been having a mini-stroke.  She tried to get up from the chair and was not able to get up on her own.  He went to try to help her to lift her and it was hard.  When she did get her bottom up off the chair she stayed in a bent position and was not able to stand up.  He put her back down on the chair and tried some more times, and ultimately able to get up and he was able to get her into the bed (the chair was next to the bed).  She could sit on the edge of the bed, but was not able to move her legs on her own to get into the bed.  He struggled to get her in the bed and was not in a mood to talk and just leaned over on one side to try to go to sleep.  He told her he was going to get the walker in the basement for her to use.  He brought up the walker and put in by the bed, and informed her that it was there, and reached to see where it was in the event that she needed to use it through the night.  She did get up around 3:15 this morning to use the bathroom and her husband asked if she needed assistance, and she said that she was able to get up and go to the bathroom, and moved her legs just slow and was able to use the walker.  She was feeling much better at that time.  She got up one more time during the night and was not in need of the walker and was back to bed.  This morning when they got up at 8:00 Am and she was back to her normal self.   She came down the steps and was like nothing had ever happened.  They called her son who works in the hospital and he told them to call us to see if there were any other people that had the same reaction.    She stated while he was giving me this information that she did not recall a lot of the events that he was telling me.

My mom died Saturday morning - within the 24-hour period of her vaccine. She was feeling so great leading up to it, active, stripping the guest bedroom sheets, bubbly, and excited for us to be able to finally visit her soon.

                                                suffers from asthma but never had the symptoms she&#39;s had now; shortness of breath; hoarse/ hoarseness; audible wheezing; doesn&#39;t have the energy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). This 84-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as 0.3 ml, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2019 and ongoing, when she would sleep her oxygen would drop, and shrunk from 5 feet 5 1/4 inches to now 5 feet 2 inches. She never found out why her oxygen saturations dropped at night but she does not have sleep apnea. Her saturations would drop down to the 80s and she would still be sleeping. Concomitant medications included ongoing albuterol [salbutamol] taken for asthma and oxygen taken for &#34;when she would sleep her oxygen would drop&#34; from 2012 and ongoing. Patient previously took Anoro and Qvar in Aug2019. Patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 25Feb2021 (lot number: EN6206, NDC:59267-1000-01, Expiry date unknown) in the left arm. With the first vaccine she did not have any symptoms, she thought she got saline. Only symptoms she felt were when they told her to wait 15 minutes and she sat there and when she got up and she was driving and had her window down her nose felt like it was swelling. She lost her sense of smell due to an injury and she had an acute sense of smell of tobacco from the car next to her. That is the only symptom she had. The acute sense of smell was about 30 minutes after she got her injection, about 5-7 minutes after that. She left about 10:30 am and it happened around 10:35-10:37 am. The acute sense of smell was short lived, it happened for a minute or two. Several years ago she had shoulder surgery and had her great granddaughter and she was playing with her and her foot got caught in the coffee table and she fell and her nose got cut and lost her sense of smell. When asked for seriousness criteria, patient stated it was significant because she had not been able to smell since 2011 and she had the sensation of her nose swelling. She felt like that but she was driving and could not look at her nose. She didn&#39;t have the feeling 15 minutes after the vaccine, she had been driving for 5-7 minutes and had the feeling and it was exactly when she got in the car. It was significant because she was able to smell something. Patient had her second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 18Mar2021 and had shortness of breath. She suffers from asthma but never had the symptoms she&#39;s had now. She did not seem to be getting better and the slightest movement, she&#39;s short of breath. She is taking the medicine that she normally takes but never had to take it this much. She was short of breath and not paying that much attention to it, when she goes out she wears a mask, since last year, and she went to put the trash out and had shortness of breath stepping out the back door. She was talking to a friend long distance and she told her she was so short of breath. To get out of bed and turn in bed she&#39;s more short of breath. The shortness of breath may have started before Friday 26Mar2021 but that&#39;s when she noticed it. She would have her mask on, park her car and go to the post office and when she would walk to her PO box, which is the first of the boxes, she was exhausted and not getting enough air and she noticed it. But then when she went outside to put the trash out, just a step outside she was short of breath, that&#39;s when she began to notice. She has never been this short of breath and her breathing and exchange of air has never been this bad. She thought she would maybe get her smell back and in all the years she&#39;s been diagnosed with asthma she&#39;s never had the wheezing and shortness of breath that she&#39;s had now. She&#39;s never heard herself wheeze. Monday night she was up at 3 am and got up to go to the bathroom and she was so short of breath. She had to take it at 3:30 am and that had never happened to her. She never had wheezing until the second vaccine. She doesn&#39;t need a stethoscope to hear the wheezing and that most people have asthma with wheezing but she did not. Patient was not taking the Qvar until after the second dose of the vaccine and was only using the albuterol before. She would take two puffs in her car and then put two masks before getting out. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No AE required a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was scheduled to see her primary doctor on 13Apr2021 but could not get in earlier and attempted to see her pulmonary doctor and the earliest she can is 07Apr2021 and she has that appointment. Patient was also very hoarse. From time to time medications like her inhaler for her asthma sometimes makes her hoarse. This time she has the hoarseness even when she doesn&#39;t take her inhaler. She has audible wheezing. She would not consider the shortness of breath life threatening but it is concerning because she is not able to do what she needs to do because she doesn&#39;t have the energy. Hoarseness is worsening because she is taking more of the medications she&#39;s normally taking and now she is taking the inhaler twice a day because she is more short of breath. The one inhaler she is using is Qvar. She has been taking the albuterol more also. Hoarseness is not life threatening, it is effective but it is not disabling. The more she talks, the more hoarse she gets. Relatedness of drug to reactions shortness of breath, very hoarse, by primary source reporter (Method of assessment: Global Introspection) was related. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Asthma aggravated and Shortness of breath cannot be excluded. Medical history of asthma may provide a plausible alternative explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

                                                Confirmed DVT in the left leg; COVID test (PCR swab): positive on 26Dec2020; COVID test (PCR swab): positive on 26Dec2020; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional. An 85-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# ELO140, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm (deltoid; unknown side) on 23Dec2020 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2017 and ongoing, high blood pressure from 2017 and ongoing, atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) from 2019 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was administered first dose of the COVID vaccine on 23Dec2020 and then was swabbed for COVID on 26Dec2020, and then on 28Dec2020 her PCR swab was positive for COVID. She was asymptomatic until she started complaining of leg pain. She ordered an ultrasound for the patient on 30Dec2020, and it confirmed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in left leg. The patient was being treated with anticoagulant apixaban (ELIQUIS) currently. Caller stated that this could be that it (DVT) is from COVID, but her real question was, could it be from the vaccine? In Pfizer&#39;s information packet for patients, there is section on what to tell your provider prior to getting vaccinated. One of the things on there is if you have a bleeding disorder or are on an anticoagulant. There is no explanation as to why it was in the packet of information. Caller has looked everywhere and can not figure out why that is on the FAQ/packet information. The patient was due for the second dose on 13Jan2020, but she was worried and hesitant to approve it. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (PCR swab): positive on 26Dec2020, ultrasound of the left leg: confirmed DVT on 30Dec2020. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event &#34;COVID test (PCR swab): positive&#34; is related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The event occurred 3 days after vaccination, when vaccine was not expected to achieve the effect.  The event DVT of legs is not considered related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The patient had underlying diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, which are considered as risk factors for DVT. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 85-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included dementia. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient popped hot 02Jan2021 along with 4 others on the hall she lived. Within 9 days 50&#43; patients were positive. All had the vaccine the same day. Patient was test positive on 02Jan2021. She was on day 12 of her quarantine when she started to get worse. She was unresponsive by 16Jan2021 and passed 18Jan2021. We were with her from 14Jan2021 to 18Jan2021. But had not been allowed to visit with her since Mar2020. And what post treatment pairs well with it? Publicly we hear Remdesivir and Bamlanivimab but these patients only received a general antibiotic and some vitamins. Death cause was Xrays showed covid Poss pockets all in her lungs on 15Jan2021. No autopsy was performed.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported event of positive for corona virus infection for the lack of efficacy of the vaccine. However, based on the mechanism of action of the vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine is given. Case will be reevaluated based on follow-up information; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Xrays showed covid Poss pockets all in her lungs on 15Jan

                                                I got the vaccine at 8 AM that morning and I was fine until about 5PM and I got very cold. I was freezing. I had a chill.  I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

Started abating by Thursday 2/25/21 evening. Advised ice pack on arm, but pt. said it was too sore on day after dose given (Wednesday) to apply. Pt. took one aspirin on Wednesday morning. Advised her she could take a second later in the day. (Yesterday pt. stated she had taken a Tylenol. Today upon review she realized that she took an aspirin. Ibuprofen is also available. Advised pt. take an ibuprofen now over the phone as I waited. Taken at 8:13pm EST. No further medication taken on Wednesday. (Also encouraged ice pack on neck Wednesday for ongoing strong headache / neck pain yesterday. Pt. does not remember if she tried that. Head/neck pain resolved today.) Pt. states swelling today (Thursday) is mild-to-moderate, less than yesterday, but still noticeable. Doesn&#39;t hurt as much as it did yesterday, she says. She can now lift her arm without pain.

                                                a little bit of arm pain/Her arm was a little amount sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 85-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 09:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Splenic marginal cell non-Hodgkin&#39;s Lymphoma of the B cells and spleen; infection in her bursae sack in her knee and she was in the hospital for that; she also had three infections. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that the shot was so simple, and she hates shots. It was the Pfizer shot given by a nurse at the clinic. Before bed on 01Feb2021, she thought her arm was starting to hurt so she took a pain pill. She doesn&#39;t think she needed it. She got the vaccine at 09:45 in the morning of 01Feb2021. She thought she had arm pain, but she didn&#39;t really ever get it. She didn&#39;t experience pain or anything otherwise. She also stated that she had a little bit of arm pain, her arm was a little amount sore. But it went away by the next day on 02Feb2021. It was very minor. She didn&#39;t feel like it was worth reporting. She felt it once in a while if she moves her arm but is not enough to mention. She hates shots, and this one wasn&#39;t as bad as half of the other shots she has had. She has no complaint about it. The outcome of the event was recovered on 02Feb2021.

A little white dot appeared where needle was inserted. Arm swelled. Initially thought it was common. But was not getting better and was painful and made her not feel well. She went to the doctors thankfully a few days after and was advised that it was infected. Could have been dangerous for her if infection continued to move through her body.   She is now on antibiotics. This is strange to have an infection which makes us feel the needle was not properly sterilized? Something foreign entered at the time of that shot and we would like to have answers. The doctors could not even identify why this happened.  Company Pfizer..

An 85-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot# EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 09:15 (at the age of 85-years-old) in right arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient had allergies and asthma for years. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported she got her first COVID-19 Vaccine on Saturday, 20Feb2021. She said she developed a rash on Monday (22Feb2021), and was very itchy. She said she didn&#39;t have the rash on her legs. She said she had the feeling of needles all over her entire body and face, along with a hot feeling on 22Feb2021. She said she was contributing her rash to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She asked if she got the second COVID-19 Vaccine, would the rash occur again, and would the rash be worse. The caller said she was scheduled to receive her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose on Thursday, 11Mar2021. The caller was advised she would be transferred to Pfizer Medical Information for further assistance. She had macular degeneration and had difficulty seeing in Feb2021. She clarified she felt like her face had needles going through it. She said her neck, chest, and upper back are a purple-red color on 22Feb2021. She said she was so uncomfortable that it was hard for her to wear clothes, and she had to sleep in the nude. Treatment: she was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and her daughter gave her an over-the-counter cortisone cream in a tube to use for her rash. She said she just started using the cortisone cream today (25Feb2021). She said she did not have the Benadryl and cortisone cream tube with her to provide the UPC/NDC Numbers, Lot Numbers, and Expiration Dates. She planned to call her doctor to see if he will give her something for the rash once she was finished speaking with Pfizer. The events did not require emergency room or physician office. Outcome of macular degeneration and difficulty seeing was unknown, and outcome of other events were not recovered.

                                                fainted; passed out and was unconscious; still kind of feel weak; bruise on both knees; fall; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable registered nurse (patient, Retired RN). An 85-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at single dose via an unknown route injection in left arm on 23Jan2021 around 08:15 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high which was controlled with medication, allergic to penicillin and acetylsalicylic acid;ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN).  She had lost weight and shrunk according to when she went to the doctor 2 months ago. No other products were taken. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect; no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine, no events following prior vaccinations. No family medical history relevant to the events. Patient passed out on her way home on 23Jan2021 (unknown time). The event required a visit to Emergency room, but not a Physician office. The event clinical course was as follows: She got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. Patient reported that after being monitored at the vaccination site for 20minutes, she left to go catch the bus and fainted before boarding the bus.  She remembered getting on the bus, but did not remember crossing the street. She passed out and was unconscious. An ambulance was called and they took her back to the hospital where she got the vaccine. She was taken by ambulance back to the ER, stayed for half the day, she received IV fluids, and a brain scan due to her fall. She stated that she still feels kind of weak as of 29Jan2021.  She did not know what time it happened, because she lost her sense of time on that day because she did not remember. When she got to the hospital she woke up and wondered where she was because she did not remember what happened. They got an x-ray of her head to see if she had bumped it, but it was negative. She did have a bruise on both knees. They gave her IV fluids, and kept her there for a little while, then sent her home. She called her doctor the next day, but he was busy, so she talked to the nurse. No treatment was recommended, just said to get a lot of rest. She was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 13Feb2021 and was scared to death. Patient verified that she was not admitted to the hospital. Investigation assessment were performed. They hooked her up to the monitor, did an x-ray and a CT scan while at the hospital on 23Jan2021 which were normal (both fine), and gave her IV fluids. Outcome of fainted, fall, passed out and was unconscious was resolved on 23Jan2021. Outcome of kind of feel weak was not resolved. Outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainted and unconscious cannot be fully excluded.  The underlying history of high blood pressure for this 85 years old patient  might provide an alternative explanation.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 86-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EC9231, expiry date Apr2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from 13Apr2020 and she got a plasma donation, in Apr2020 because she was not in good shape when she had COVID. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported) on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter said that the patient&#39;s doctor told her to still get the COVID vaccine and on 10Jan2021, she had been throwing up, sweating, and lightheaded and these were the side effects with the second dose. The caller stated that no one else had side effects like these. It was reported that the patient had no other family and the reporter felt really bad for the patient and wanted to get her some sort of information. The patient said that she was feeling a little better than she did last night, but she was laying in bed. The patient&#39;s symptoms started yesterday 10Jan2021, the next day after receiving the vaccine. The reporter said that the patient can barely speak to her. She said that the patient said that she was feeling a little better, but she just whispered it. The reporter asked if it was because the patient had antibodies. Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 21Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes therapy on her back from the past, from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included melatonin to sleep and, paracetamol (TYLENOL) to sleep. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Jan2021 at around 2:50 PM, the next morning on 22Jan2021, she felt extreme exhaustion, she&#39;d get up and have to get back to bed, not able to eat, and she thought she has low blood sugar. She got up and had a bowl of cereal. On an unspecified date, the patient also reported numbness in face, legs and slight headache, and need to eat all of a sudden or pass out, and these has gone on for five days now (at time of report). The patient also reported that her lip has a slight droop on left side of her face which was concerning her. The patient reported that after numbness and not eating, she had some ice cream and her whole chest froze up, and it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest felt like ice which never had happened before. It has been an effort to talk, she was really working hard to talk. The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 25Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for protection against virus. Medical history included COVID from 18Nov2020 and ongoing (recovering/resolving). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry: Mar2021) intramuscular in the left arm on 04Jan2021 for protection against virus with no problem. On 26Jan2021, patient had one tiny blood blister but now was covered in them. Her hands, feet, and torso are covered and are painful. The patient has trouble with ambulation and using her walker since. The palms of her hands are covered front and back too. The patient was also covered on her toes and areas of the abdomen around the umbilicus area. Had the first dose on 04Jan2021 and the second on 25Jan2021. Her mother has an appointment on 03Feb2021, and caller wanted to know if this is uncommon or a rare side effect. The reporter has found a couple of articles, but most of them refer to pediatrics and rashes and she didn&#39;t see any side effects about blood blisters for her mother&#39;s age group. Further stated that areas covered are progressively worse and disabling since her mother was using a walker to ambulate. Has not been able to really use the walker due to the soreness and tenderness of palms. Her mother had the disease (COVID) back on 18Nov2020 and was symptomatic and was mild. No other vaccines received the same time. No history of problems with vaccines in past. They can&#39;t think of nothing that was new, no new medications, lotions, creams, or detergents, nothing new. The events did not require a visit to emergency room nor a physician office. Onset date of events reported was on 26Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered. The reporter assessed the seriousness of events as disability. The events were assessed as related to vaccines.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                left arm painful; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 03Feb2021 at 12:05 (at the age of 86-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient had no family history related to the adverse events. The patient had no prior adverse events to vaccinations nor any prior vaccinations within four weeks of vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same day. The patient experienced left arm painful on 06Feb2021, which was reported with disability. The clinical course was reported as follows: The first 3-4 days (as reported), there were no side effects; however, her arm was painful for days 5- 7, and on day 9, it was still a little sore but better. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event, which included a visit to the chiropractor. The clinical outcome of left arm painful was recovering. The primary reporter (patient) assessed the causality between the event and the suspect product as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a causal relationship between event &#34;left arm painful&#34; and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 86-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL9262 expiry date 21May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 86 years old) at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL8982) on 22Jan2021 at single dose in upper right arm and on 22Jan2021 experienced severe headache and arm hurting. Relevant medical history includes ongoing compromised immune system diagnosed many years ago, and ongoing one kidney functioning. The patient received no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021 the patient experienced high, over the top blood pressure, delirious incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware which both required hospitalization from 13Feb2021 to 14Feb2021. It was also reported they were concerned about one kidney/ was dehydrated in 13Feb2021. On 13Feb2021 unspecified blood labs showed kidney was extremely dehydrated and Chest X-ray was good. Clinical course was reported as follows: she was just released from hospital yesterday, she took the second Pfizer COVID shot, on 12Feb2021, and became so very very ill, she expected some side effects, the first shot wasn&#39;t bad, the first all she had was a severe headache and arm hurting, but that was 3 weeks ago, and the second one she can&#39;t say how horrible it was: she had to get the paramedics there, she was very very ill. It was the worst night she has had, and she is 86 years old, and has had a multitude of serious issues but that shot was the worst. It was a combination of high blood pressure, over the top, and insomnia like she couldn&#39;t budge and open her eyes, she couldn&#39;t see anything but squares, it was like a horrible, if there is such a thing as a trip, a horrible trip, something she can&#39;t imagine wishing on anyone. The county administered it, she has several doctor, she initially provides her primary care doctor, for consent to contact, but says her nephrologist would be better, as she hasn&#39;t seen her primary care doctor in some time. Her primary care doctor doesn&#39;t know she had this, another doctor gave her permission, her nephrologist. States they were more concerned in the hospital about her kidney, she has one kidney functioning and, on mistake of the hospital, they didn&#39;t connect her to hydration, the night nurse didn&#39;t, and she was dehydrated and it was affecting her kidney. Her husband tried to call Saturday, when she had this reaction at like 06:30/07:00, but there was a huge long wait, he was calling to see about side effects, but they were beyond waiting, had to get the paramedics, her blood pressure was 178/113 and heart rate was 103. First shot was 3 weeks back. It looks like she had it on 22Jan2021, the headache and arm hurting started towards the evening, the shot was taken earlier in the day, and they started in the evening, her headache was quite severe, but with Tylenol it went away, the arm is still sore from the second vaccine, but is slightly better. Clarifies she was hospitalized for the blood pressure and delirium, like, it is best explained, like delirious: incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware, all she could see was, like if she talked about people who did LSD and trips, it was a bad trip, it was squares, she wanted to open her eyes, but could only see squares. She fell asleep Friday night about 11PM, and felt this at 04:00, and she pulled off her sleep apnea mask, she had to run to the restroom, she was weak, feeling like she would slip onto the floor, and had to get right in bed, and the insomnia continued until about 7AM, that was when she started to be able to focus on like words, she was able to say words in her mind, it was like a bad nightmare. She was admitted to the hospital, she was in the emergency room (ER), the paramedics took her there Saturday, about 07:30, took her to the hospital after immediate heart checking, an intravenous (IV) of some kind, and brought her to the hospital and she was in X-rays and what not, they did procedures in the ER, and they suggested her to be observed overnight, they watched her and things started to become more normal, but she is still not clear headed, she is woozy, like foggy. High, over the top blood pressure outcome: It has been back to a good blood pressure. Insomnia is ok- she slept ok last night. What is left: the night she woke up, so early Sunday morning, in the hospital, she was profusely sweating like someone came to her room and showered her bed with water, her sheets and blankets were soaked and this morning she woke, she got up, was still very woozy, and asked her husband to help get her out of bed, and she changed her nightgown and after an hour she got in the shower, as she was sweating again, not sweating, but occasionally on and off chills, she is taking off her nightshirt and putting on a bed jacket, she gets warm and cold, hot and cold. She had blood labs a chest X-ray, heart monitor the whole time until she was discharged, and everything was good except the kidney was extremely dehydrated. This was all on Saturday as well. On her first visit to get the vaccine, at that time, the facility was a big mall, and they handed her what to look for after the injection, and she didn&#39;t notice until this morning, it says if you have an immune system that is compromised, it could affect it, and she has immune system that is compromised diagnosed many years ago. Over the top blood pressure and insomnia had resolved, arm sore was resolving, dehydrated and affecting kidney had not resolved, final outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

An 86-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL8982 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 27Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medication. The patient experienced, after she pulled put from getting it, she got shaky on 27Jan2021. It went way after about 5 minutes. She gets that when gets a shot for dental work, so maybe it was the same reaction her body does, but it was gone before got home. On 27Jan2021, she had a sore arm for about 4.5 days, and it was difficult to sleep on that arm which was very sensitive to touch, and it turned a little red on 28Jan2021. She noted the soreness that night. She can lay on it now, it was sensitive in the center where the shot went in, but not bad. She was also tired that evening of 27Jan2021. She doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with it, but she got a cold sore, when she is stressed she gets a cold sore on her lip. This was noted yesterday (01Feb2020). She has medication for it from the doctor, and had to take for 3 days, and it usually clears it up. The cold sore was blistering, but she was susceptible to them with stress, so she was not surprised. Patient recovered from the event of tremor on 27Jan2021, turned a little red on 01Feb2021 and tired on 27Jan2021. Event sore arm was recovering while for the remaining events was unknown.

                                                Starts around 4 pm.  Lot of pain right side of face like:  1.  toothache, whole jaw aches   2.  neck arthritis   3. sinus infection  4.  ear infection all at the same time.  Strong pain all through right side of face, sometimes up through eye.  Worse lying down.  Cause?   Dental exam complete mouth x-rays indicated no problems with any teeth.  Saw Dr. 3/3/2021, was checked for ear, sinus infections, felt all around my neck, no problems.  Prescribed gabapentin, told to continue the Tylenol Arthritis I had been taking on my own.  Symptoms continue today, only right side of face, head, temple area, sometimes up through right eye, teeth on right side ache.  Only take the Tylenol once a day since that is all that I need it.  More painful if I lie down in bed at night so sit upright until pain is gone; then sleep through the night.  No problem all during the day when I?m up and around doing whatever. . .no pain then.  Someone in my dental office has the same symptoms along with Bells Palsy, was told by her doctor it&#39;s from the Covid shot and could last 3 months? Pharmacist also told me filling the gabapentin for several others with same symptoms (I live in a small town).

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

An 86-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed in 1971 (reported as 50 years ago) and ongoing; type 2 diabetes in 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) which resolved in 2019 (about 2 years ago) after the patient lost some weight; she had an episode of A-Fib in 2019 when her potassium was low (lower than the current hospitalization), once the potassium was corrected, her A-Fib resolved. The physician stated that patient has shrunk and was now about 5 foot 2 inches. Clarified that this has not recently occurred since the vaccine; stated it was happening just with age. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any issues with the first dose of the vaccine. She received her second vaccine dose on 24Mar2021. The physician spoke with the patient on Friday, 26Mar2021, and the patient was fine. On Saturday, 27Mar2021, the patient had an episode of diarrhea, vomiting and was weak. The lady cleaning the patient&#39;s house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient&#39;s son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her. Since the reporter was a physician, she knew which questions to ask the patient and saw that she still had some problems. The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient&#39;s potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021. The clots must have come from the heart valves since the carotid studies were fine and if the clots had been in her legs, they would&#39;ve gone to her lungs not to her brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: negative, potassium: low, carotid studies: fine, MRI of the head: multiple small emboli in brain, all on Mar2021; and potassium: low, height: 5 foot 2 inches (shrunk), and weight: lost, all on an unspecified date. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness and fall required emergency room visit. The outcome of the event difficult walking was recovering and unknown for all other events. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fall, potassium low, cerebral embolism, thrombosis, and &#34;potassium dropped and she went into A-Fib and threw clots&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and being life threatening; and the events aphasia and gait disturbance were assessed as serious due to hospitalization. All other events were non-serious. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 until 02Apr2021.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ET7534), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (at the age of 86years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, blood pressure high, multiple sclerosis, and wheelchair user; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing baclofen (10mg, three times a day), metformin (750 mg, twice a day), amlodipine besilate (10mg, once a day), losartan (50 mg, once a day), magnesium (two times a day), metoprolol (50 mg, 3x/day), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12), and glimepiride (takes 1mg in one meal and as another meal she takes half of a mg); and Statin (unspecified) 10 mg, once a day; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine on 18Mar2021 and she did fine but an hour later when she got home, the reporter tried to help her up off of her wheelchair onto another chair and she could not stand. She had extreme weakness and then she felt like her throat was, like somebody was choking her, like their hands around her throat and then her jaw felt like it was getting huge. Then, her blood pressure went up to 170, the patient was given lots of continuous water and blood pressure pill. She started to feel better after that. The reporter further stated, &#34;She has had various different problems. I do not know if it is allergies or what from what she already has but she did have a lot of it and exhausting stuff afterwards. There is mainly that choking feeling that is frightening that she had one hour after&#34;. It was also reported that the patient developed some rash on her back and hives on her legs. It was not right away. It was kind of a day or two after. The outcome of events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts needed. Further information is expected.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 16:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing multiple sclerosis , ongoing hypertension, ongoing diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing stent placed and spasms; and from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously had flu shot and feel a little bit sick, it hit her lot harder with the flu shot. Concomitant medication includes, unspecified, diabetic and hypertensive medication and medication for spasms. On 25Mar2021, 45 minutes to an hour after the patient&#39;s first dose, the patient felt like someone was choking her and felt like her jaw was &#34;getting large&#34; without physically getting large. The patient was not able to get out of her wheelchair, even though she was normally able to do so on her own, and her blood pressure systolically reached 170. Her mother was given &#34;excess water&#34; and was given her hypertensive medication &#34;a little early&#34; which caused her pressure to come down quickly. Based on this reaction that her mother had, caller would like to know if it was safe for the patient to receive her second dose of the vaccine. They stayed about 15 min at the drive thru to make sure there was no reaction. It was about a 30-minute drive home with traffic. It happened within the hour, right when she got in the house. The patient had a reaction to the first dose, and the caller wanted to know if it was safe for her to get the second. Within the first hour the patient felt like someone was choking her, she felt like her jaw was swelling, she felt extreme weakness and could not stand, and her blood pressure shot up. It shot up to 170, but she did not know the diastolic. The patient felt like she was choking so she was doused with water to push anything through in case that would help. Within a couple of hours, the patient started to feel better. They gave her excess fluids and gave her blood pressure medication a little bit earlier and everything came back down. She was frightened when this first occurred. The feeling of choking and the feeling of jaw swelling got better and went away within a few hours. The patient had multiple sclerosis so weakness is always an issue and mobility is always an issue. She knew her tolerance and what she could do. That day they had taken her in a wheelchair from the car to the house and she could not get out of the wheelchair, which was not normal for her. This happened within an hour of the shot. The weakness lingered the longest. That side effect did linger. It took a couple of days. She was using a Hugo again to get herself around the house and believes this extreme weakness has gone away. She was exercising on a stepper when the caller was talking to her. Caller did not believe there had been any lasting effects. Blood pressure shot up: Started within an hour of the vaccine. She had been hypertensive for quite some time historically. Her medication had been keeping it under control. They administered her dose early that day and it brought it down, it did not linger. The patient had been housebound since the pandemic started. The outcome of the event blood pressure shot up was recovering, while the outcome of the event couldn&#39;t stand was unknown; and the outcome of the rest of the events was recovered on 25Mar2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.

My arm hurt me really bad and my armpit hurt really bad. This started a couple of hours after receiving the injection. This lasted about 2 days. I noticed the red spots (bright red and flat) about noon on Friday. They are still there and have not changed since then.

                                                The patient received her 1st Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine then within approximately 10 minutes she started complaining of shortness of breath and stated she &#34;needed oxygen for my heart failure&#34;.  I then directed her son to wheel her back to a room and the charge nurse grabbed the Oxygen for us.  We took a pulse on room air and she was bouncing around 84-85%.    At this point she began to have uncontrolled jerking movements in her neck, upper and lower extremities.  She was talking during these and never lost consciousness.  When the shaking started I had the nurse call 911 to get EMS on the way.    She then had her O2 by nasal canula placed and it was turned up to 6L to start until O2 came up to 98%.  We then slowly turned town to 3L and maintained SpO2 around 97%.  Involuntary muscle jerking continued although it was a little less severe.  EMS came and transferred her to the ER.

She described her vision going black. She said that she did not eat today at her normal times which could have contributed to the event. She is asking if the vaccine could have had anything to do with this?  She has not had a previous episode like this before. She did have some minor injection site pain at the time of the vaccine but that has subsided.  Follow-up call with patient on 1/30/31 at 19:37: Spoke to the patient. She is feeling better today.  She did not see her doctor or go to the ED. She checked her glucose yesterday and it was high. She said she thinks her symptoms were from not eating her normal meals around the time of the vaccine.

I didn&#39;t think it could be related to the vaccine as it was so soon, and only in the one place.  It had lasted until now and I&#39;ve had three physical therapy visits so far, though it is not as bad, but it&#39;s over three weeks.  I didn&#39;t think it could be related until my doctor&#39;s office said they had four cases of the exact same thing, and in younger people. (20&#39;s and 30&#39;s).  At first, the PT said it was due to a pulled muscle, though I had done nothing at all to account for that.

                                                Patient received the injection on May 2nd.  Following the injection, we noticed an increased weakness and general achiness.  On the  8th she was so weak that we purchased a gait belt to assist her.  We were not super concerned as we were expecting the second shot to cause body aches or flu like symptoms based on what we had heard from others who had received both vaccine shots.  She continued to be unsteady and we found that she has a mild UTI which we had begun treating with prescribed antibiotics. Late afternoon on the 11th, mother suffered a major stroke.  we did not take her to the hospital because we had already been told that they would not be able to do anything at her age should she suffer a stroke.  On the 12th I called the doctors office and asked for them to send Hospice to the house as we could tell that she was dying.  Mother died on the 13th.    Just a week prior to her death I had spoken with Dr. and we had discussed how that she was declining in health but that she was not even close to needing Hospice, yet she is dead a week later.  Less than 2 weeks after getting her second Covid Shot.

An 87-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 05Feb2021 at 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 86-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced urinary tract infection; the patient previously took clindamycin hydrochloride (DYNACIN) and experienced allergy, gabapentin and experienced allergy, doxycycline which made her pass out and lose complete control of muscles and everything and put her in the hospital for 3 days.  The patient experienced severe headache on 14Feb2021; the patient collapsed because of weakness in her legs/ legs collapsed on her and experienced pain in her legs/leg pain, weakness/real weak and fatigue, all on 22Feb2021; shaky/real shaky on 24Feb2021, vomiting on 26Feb2021, thigh pain and hip pain on 27Feb2021. Clinical course: on 22Feb2021 she saw her primary care physician for leg pain, weakness, fatigue and the same severe headache that she was seen for on 14Feb2021. On 22Feb2021 she was prescribed cyclobenzaprine and tramadol as pain medication. Before she took any of the cyclobenzaprine or tramadol on the night of 22Feb2021 her legs collapsed on her. On 24Feb2021 they called the doctor and told them that she had collapsed again, and he said to stop the cyclobenzaprine and changed tramadol dose to half strength. She started being shaky. On 26Feb2021 they called the doctor back because she had the same symptoms with the addition of vomiting. They said to stop the tramadol and start taking TYLENOL. On 27Feb2021 they went back to the urgent care for the same symptoms as well as leg pain, thigh pain, hip pain, being really shaky and real weak.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: everything was ok (her bloodwork is fine) on an unspecified date, computerized tomogram (CAT scan): everything checked out just fine on 14Feb2021, Urine test: urinary tract infection on 04Feb2021  and worsened urinary tract infection on 16Feb2021.   Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with cyclobenzaprine (strength: 5mg) as a muscle relaxer and tramadol (strength: 50 mg) as pain medication both from 22Feb2021, tramadol was stopped on 26Feb2021 and TYLENOL (every 8 hrs. strength: 650 mg, Lot Number: SBA002, Expiry date: Dec2022) was started on the same date. The patient outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She said she just needed to catch her breath and was given a few minutes to sit prior to vaccination. Pharmacist asked her if she felt okay today, which she replied yes. She stated the nurse assisting her down the hall was walking to fast for her. After her vaccination patient remained seated for 20 minutes and still reported shortness of breath. A pulse ox was placed on her finger and her pulse was ranging between 44-80 and O2 range was 94-98. When her pulse rate would drop, she had uncontrollable body tremors. EMS was dispatched within an hour after vaccination and patient was transported to the ED.

                                                Dizziness; Pain in the lower extremities; pain in feet; legs hurt; Felt poorly; Blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly; Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s sister). An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 07:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, bypass in 2010, hearing is very bad on the phone, arthritis pain, headache, and blood thinner. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included metoprolol for hypertension, quinapril for hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) for hypertension, ascorbic acid/ calcium/ minerals NOS/ retinol/ tocopheryl acetate/ vitamin B NOS/ vitamins NOS/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER), calcium carbonate (CALTRATE), atorvastatin, warfarin as blood thinner, spironolactone, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) for arthritis pain and headache; all were ongoing. The patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and had reactions to the vaccine or something else. That day, the patient&#39;s left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain), but that was expected, and it went away within 2 days (initially didn&#39;t report it because it was expected). Yesterday (18Jan2021), the patient experienced dizziness and pain in the lower extremities. Last night (18Jan2021; about 6 days after the injection), the patient woke up, felt poorly, and was very dizzy (feeling of dizziness), then, later on, had pain in both lower extremities. The patient took her blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly with result of 159. The patient&#39;s heart rate, temperature, and pulse oximetry were okay on 18Jan2021. She then walked to the bathroom, came back, and went back into bed. The second time she said her legs hurt but this morning she is feeling better than she was. Today (19Jan2021), the pain in feet is better, and the dizziness is gone. Pulse oximetry and temperature were okay this morning (19Jan2021). The patient was wondering if these effects could be related to the vaccine, since the dose was received 6 days ago. The patient was not sure if could possibly be related to the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was that she spent a lot of time doing paperwork on the computer yesterday (18Jan2021) and perhaps that caused some of the symptoms. The patient&#39;s sister called to ask if Pfizer has heard of any late adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccine like this patient&#39;s, 6 days later. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 04Feb2021 (day 22) and her sister asked what if it&#39;s not available. The patient&#39;s sister was concerned about interval and potentially being unable to gain access to the second dose due to supply issues. The patient recovered from &#34;Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain)&#34; on 15Jan2021; and from &#34;Dizziness&#34; on 19Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the other events.

An 88-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 11:45 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung cancer. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient had unspecified other medication in two weeks. The reporter&#39;s mother&#39;s experienced mild allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she wants to know whether or not she should be getting her second dose. She will be asking her doctor as well as they were advised by the nurse administering the vaccine and also the doctor&#39;s nurses who observed her mother afterwards, but she was also advised to contact Pfizer. On 20Jan2021, at 12:00, within 5 minutes, the patient experienced flushed in the face/warm, red face, tingling sensation of lips but no swelling, no increased blood pressure, no hives or rash, no tongue or throat swelling, no dizziness, no nausea. It was mild but concerning. The patient was treated with oral Benadryl and Pepcid IV (also reported as IV of peptids), and extended observation for 1 hour and 30 minutes.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EM9809) intramuscularly, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021 at 10:30 (at age of 88 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; gabapentin, via an unspecified route of administration from 08Feb2021 to 15Feb2021 at 100 mg, daily, then via an unspecified route of administration from 15Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 08Feb2022) to an unspecified date, at 200 mg, daily for feet burn. Medical history included hiatus hernia surgery from Nov2019, surgery from an unknown date, vomited after surgery for three nights/days, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cancer, feet burning, feet red, asthma and thyroid. Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), fluid pill, vitamin D, vitamin C, potassium, acid reflux pill before nighttime before supper, thyroid pill, singulair pill. The patient previously took Codeine and percocet [oxycodone hydrochloride;oxycodone terephthalate;paracetamol] and experienced allergies. Two years before in Nov2019 she had hiatus hernia surgery. Her stomach went into her chest. She was in rehab. She had to have the surgery done twice. She went from one hospital and then she went to another and it was taken care of there. When she went to rehab after her surgery, all she did was vomit day in and day out. Her current vomiting reminds her of this experience. They finally did take care of it. She came out of the hospital and was vomiting. She clarifies she had problems with vomiting for the last 6 months before this current experience. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s eating. They say it&#39;s acid and she has Gerd. She does try to get her exercises in. When she was in the hospital, they found she had cancer, which they are just watching for now. When querying what kind of cancer she has, the caller explains she didn&#39;t have them do a biopsy. She didn&#39;t want to go that far into it. She didn&#39;t want any extensive treatment. At first, they were keeping check of the cancer every 3 months. Now, she is going ever year. She last went in November. The patient experienced macular degeneration on an unspecified date, vomiting on 23Feb2021 at 17:30, temperature 99.2 on 25Feb2021 at 10:00, very tired on 23Feb2021, arm was sore couldn&#39;t lay on it on 23Feb2021. Patient had the first Covid vaccine Tuesday morning, clarified to 23Feb2021 at 10:30AM and around 5:30PM that night she started vomiting. She vomited all night long and all day Wednesday and Wednesday night, and this morning. So far, it had stopped. She was trying to hold water down, but she couldn&#39;t keep water down, the water would come up. She clarifies further she tried to take a sip but it kept coming up. She called her doctor who was a practitioner and she told her to drink ginger ale and maybe crackers. She told the doctor that her daughter sent her electrolytes and she was told that was fine to take. She tried toast this morning and she couldn&#39;t hold it down. She&#39;s been eating very slow, taking little bites at time and she had been holding it down. She did have temperature of 99.2 on 25Feb2021, but half hour or so before it was down to 96 now. She couldn&#39;t take medicine that she normally takes because she&#39;ll throw it up anyway. She tried to take a few of her pills but it didn&#39;t stay down, she threw them up. Around 9am, she took her thyroid and that stayed down. So far, that&#39;s doing good. She takes Advair for asthma and she took that, that&#39;s okay. She took her singulair pill. So far, the three of these medications have stayed down, and she took 2 Tylenol. Patient took Tylenol twice. She knows it was Extra strength, took 2 pills Tuesday night but it didn&#39;t stay down. She Took 4 Tylenol today, 2 pills this morning and 2 right before her CNA left at around 3pm. Caller mentions she can&#39;t see the dosage on her Tylenol bottle. She doesn&#39;t see the dose. She mentions she will get her magnifying glass to check it out. She&#39;s afraid because she had surgery a couple years before and she vomited after surgery for three nights/days, or whatever. Today (25Feb2021), when she spoke to her doctor she was advised to call Pfizer to let them know how the vaccine is affecting her. Right now, she feels pretty good, but she was very, very tired. She&#39;s going to lay down when she gets off the phone. She had a CNA with her today and she also spoke to the nurse practitioner. The last time she vomited was around 10am. When the CNA came in, she told the caller to call the doctor but she told the CNA she&#39;d be fine. However, the CNA urged the caller to call her doctor and let them know what was going on. Her second dose was scheduled for 16Mar2021. Her doctor told her don&#39;t drink the water, drink the ginger ale and don&#39;t drink it too fast, and try crackers and toast. The patient took her temperature last night (24Feb2021) but couldn&#39;t read it that great, she thought it was 98. When the CNA came this morning (25Feb2021), she took it around 10:00AM and it was 99.2. She told the CNA to take another temperature because she didn&#39;t think she had a fever. When the CNA left, she had to leave at 3:00PM, her temperature was normal, it was 96. She thinks maybe her temperature went to 99.2 because she was drinking her tea. However, she wasn&#39;t drinking it right away, because she threw up on it. She stopped drinking an hour before her temperature was taken. She clarifies wasn&#39;t drinking the tea when the CNA came. She also mentions she broke up her the toast into little tiny pieces and felt like she was eating like a bird, but it didn&#39;t stay down so she stopped. The CNA came around 9am, maybe 8am, and clarifies it was maybe around 1030AM when she took the temperature. When the CNA left her temperature was at 96. The patient was very tired the same day she received the vaccine. She remembers went to bed with clothes on. Last night, she wanted to go to bed again with her clothes on but she couldn&#39;t stand it and she changed into her pajamas. Then, she went to the bathroom and vomited, she has a bucket by the side of her bed. It wasn&#39;t the dry heaves, stuff was coming up. She was still very tired currently. She makes the comment &#34;I forget things and then I remember afterwards&#34;. She had to get under the light to see the Covid card, it&#39;s small, it is handwritten. Caller mentions she sees the month on it. Caller reports her arm bothered her for quite a while. Last night, she went to sleep on her left side and her arm was feeling better which gave her some hope.  Her arm started hurting her the day she got the vaccine, but her arm wasn&#39;t red or anything. Her arm was feeling better this morning. She thinks if she can sleep on it and didn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s getting better. The last pills she took were Gabapentin she has been on for about 2 weeks. She explains her feet burn during the night and the doctor recommended the Gabapentin for now. However, she has had too much time trying to stop the vomiting that that took over her feet burning, so her feet didn&#39;t bother her as much. She was initially prescribed 1 pill at night before going to bed at 10pm, then when the 1 pill didn&#39;t work for a week, the doctor increased it to 2 pills at bed time at 10pm because it takes an hour to work. She stated that she was going to take the Gabapentin on Tuesday night, which was a mistake because she threw it right up and it tasted awful. Caller makes the comment she has not given the doctor the report of how that reacted yet. When probed for an NDC, Lot number or expiry date for the Gabapentin, the caller explains she can&#39;t see writing, it&#39;s in small print. She does see the Discard After: 08Feb2022. She needs to get her magnifying glass, she states she&#39;s going blind. She&#39;s been told she had macular degeneration. She doesn&#39;t think the Gabapentin is agreeing with her. She reads that it &#34;May cause drowsiness, operating vehicle which she doesn&#39;t drive, may cause dizziness, may cause vision. Call if you experience mood changes, sadness, depression..&#34; She started out taking one pill of the Gabapentin every night from Monday to Monday. The second Monday, 15 Feb2021, she started taking 2 pills at night for a total of 200mg. She took it this past Monday night until she had the vaccine and then she took it again, and now she was not taking it anymore. Her burning feet wake her up during the night, it starts at her ankles and goes halfway up her leg. She had to put her feet on a cold floor. Normally, she feels good and she usually doesn&#39;t get pain so whatever little bit of pain she has, that&#39;s the pain she gets. Her feet were burning like that for month before she called the doctor. she didn&#39;t know. Her feet were red before they started to burn, this is the latest thing. During the day, she is fine, only a nighttime her feet burn. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 98 on 24Feb2021; 99.2 on 25Feb2021; 96 on 25Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting. She was going in for a test, clarified as an MRI on the 3rd of March for her eyesight. The action taken in response to the event for gabapentin was permanently withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event &#34;Pain in arm&#34; was recovering, the outcome of the event fatigue was not recovered, the outcome of the events &#34;temperature 99.2&#34; and &#34;Vomiting&#34; was recovered, and outcome of other events was unknown.

A 88-Years-old white female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9266, expiration date: 31 May 2021), via intramuscularly in left arm on 14Feb2021 at a dose of 0.3ml as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s history included allergies to Penicillin, Cortisone, and she thinks also to Lidocaine, maybe. The patient did not have any NDC numbers, Lot numbers or expiry to provide for any of these products, as it was years ago. The patient did not receive any other medications. On 14Feb2021 about an hour after she got her vaccine; the patient had waited 40 minutes after getting the vaccine shot, and nothing happened, so she left, and while she was on her way home, she got a sensation in her nose, throat and upper chest like it was warm, and there was dryness. The patient previously used to get allergy shots because she was allergic to horse flies, and within 24 hours of being bitten, she would have hives the size of dinner plates. The patient went through allergy shots for 10 years and then she moved away and was no longer near water, so she did not think she needed the shots anymore. The patient had been getting the shots for 10 years, she would start to get where her lips felt funny and stuff after getting the shot, and her reaction to the COVID vaccine, felt similar to that, but it had dissipated within a half hour. This was probably respiratory and was not major, her nose did not close up, but it did get dry. The event resolved within an hour. The patient inquired with three physicians about if she should get the COVID vaccine, because she had an anaphylactic experience 40 years ago, before she was going to the allergist, and she had to go to the ER (emergency room), and they gave her whatever they did, Epinephrine or whatever it was, but that experience felt like she was being blown up like a straw was in her body. The patient inquired with these different physicians about told them about her experience from years ago, and what their suggestion would be, and they told the patient to go for it with getting the COVID vaccine, because it anything were to happen, it would be within 15 minutes of getting the shot, but the patient&#39;s was more than 15 minutes after getting it. The patient got the hives to the horse flies, it was usually within 24 hours. The patient did take an EPIPen with her when she went to get the COVID vaccine, because she was concerned she would have a reaction, but did not end up needing to use it. The outcome of the events was recovered.

Taken to ED and evaluated for acute stroke, TPA given. CT was not definitive. Weakness was R&gt;L. Pt confusion worsened a bit into evening of day of event, but by the following morning pt had returned to baseline. Is an independent 89 yo who otherwise lives at home alone and is highly functioning.  Pt did have a recent kyphoploasty and SI joint injection (perhaps with steroids/lidocaine).  Currently patient hospitalized, expected discharge soon, only complaint is tingling in fingers.... we believe this may have been coincidental, but due to time course are reporting here.

                                                The next morning after receiving the vaccine I noticed that my mother she talking to me, as her primary giver she knows me and comfortable to me. She tells me the same story over the over with isn&#39;t abnormal. It was every 3-4 words she was jumbling her words. I didn&#39;t think anything of it at first. I just let it go.   Early Wednesday morning  2:48am, I heard her in her bedroom. I went to check on her, I found at her dresser trying to put her watch on. She didn&#39;t know who was I or didn&#39;t know where she was. It took me about 40 minutes to calm her down. Now it was every 2 words that she was jumbling up. I finally got her back to bed. I went to send a message to her doctor. In the morning someone from the doctor&#39;s office called back I explained what was going on and they said get her to an ER.   I took her to the hospital 01/27/2021.  She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  Still not been discharged. Patient was still confused when I had to left last night, did not understand where she was at or why she had to stay there. My mother was very angry when she woke up early Wednesday is not my mom she is very lovely. One year or two years she did have a TA or mini stroke.

An 89-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 13Jan2021 10:35 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Ongoing medical history heart failure, kidney failure, scoliosis and strained hernia (causing pain down her right leg). Other medical history includes patient gave up her car and as a result she went from 5ft 4 inches to 5ft 1 inch and went from 150 pounds to 106 pounds (stated she loves this new weight. She looks fabulous and wonderful in clothes). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient was a retired school teacher, called about the shot, the vaccine, clarified as the COVID Vaccine. She mentioned she has a history of heart failure, kidney failure, scoliosis, and hernias. She was concerned about getting the vaccine and did not think she should get it, but her doctor informed her she should get it so she did. Since getting it she is having a hard time. Stated it feels like lead. She contacted her doctor and was informed to wait it out 24 hours and it would be a lot better. It was reported that the patient got the COVID Vaccine shot yesterday (13Jan2021 10:35). She mentioned her arm is hurting so bad. She contacted her doctor&#39;s office and was informed to give it another 24 hours for the pain to go away. It was reported that the patient hurts so bad, she hurts all over. She added she guesses the arm where she got the injection in is like equalizing the pain she has. She stated as soon as she got the injection everything was wonderful. It was afterwards she felt like she could not move her arm, her left arm. She felt like at first she was having a stroke. She did some self testing and was happy she realized she was not having a stroke. It was reported that the patient provided conflicting details of when arm hurting started. She initially stated it started 13Jan2021. She then stated she did not feel it until 8am in the morning of 14Jan2021 (pending clarification) when she could not move her arm and thought she was having a stroke. She commented she sleeps every 2 hours. She would later mention in report she felt the arm pain starting yesterday (as reported). Attempts made to clarify start of arm hurting, but unable to clarify further. She is scheduled to get the second does on 03Feb2021. She commented even with her age she is still very useful. She was told to continue taking acetaminophen. She has the 1000 mg, take two pills every six hours. She was told if she continued to have pain to take Aleve. Treatment was given for the events.

                                                Confused; Disorientated; Sleeping a lot/Groggy; Headache; Felt very weak, felt very tired; felt very panicky; Dizziness; Felt like she had the flu; Chills; pain in her neck; she was cold; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  This 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number PFREL1283, Expiration Date 30Apr2021), via intramuscular, on 15Jan2021 (at 12:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing lymphoedema (she gets water in her legs), ongoing severe arthritis of both knee caps (she had a cortisone shot and lidocaine in her knees), and dust allergy. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine received in Jan2020 and in Oct2020 (with terrible reaction: pain in arm, numb in arm and muscle pain arm for 6 weeks). Past drug history included allergy to lidocaine (her face swelled up), and hydrocortisone (CORTISONE). She was in a wheelchair. Surgical history included 2 hip replacements. Relevant concomitant medications included drug for lymphoedema. The patient stated she started having side effects almost immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She felt very panicky, felt very weak, felt very tired. She had like a headache. Some of the symptoms started the day she got the shot and then more symptoms arose the day after. She was very tired and was sleeping a lot the next day. She felt very like groggy. In fact, she was so groggy, she pressed the wrong button in her chair. She clarified she has lymphedema and she has to be in a lift chair to keep her legs elevated. When she needs to get up, she presses a certain button to raise and lift the chair into a sitting position. However, that day, her doorbell rang (her meals are delivered to her) and she was so groggy and confused, that she pressed the button that put her straight out into a lying position instead of a sitting position. She ended up sliding off the chair and onto the floor. She had to call for assistance (there is an emergency button she can press). She had to be lifted off the floor. She explained to them she didn&#39;t end up on the floor from walking, she slid off the chair. She was so disoriented she pressed the wrong button. She felt like she had the flu, she was cold, she had the chills. She was laying down, covered up with 2 blankets. She couldn&#39;t move. It was terrible. At the time, she slid off the chair, she had to go the bathroom. She is on a water pill which makes things worse, but she has a bedside commode close to her lift chair. When she was trying to get off the chair go to the bathroom (which is only 4 or 5 steps away from the commode), she was so disoriented, she pressed the wrong button. She has had this chair for 5 years.  She slid off the chair and ended up hitting the floor with her rear end. She remained on the nice cold floor (its a ceramic tile floor) until they came to pick her up. She mentioned she has had 2 hip replacements and once she is on the floor, she can&#39;t get up. Once assistance from where she lives came to pick her up, she was asked if she need to go the hospital or call ambulance. She explained to them she didn&#39;t fall. She slid off the chair. She is a very active person. Although she is almost 90, year is not senile. She slid off the chair, she didn&#39;t fall. The patient stated that she got the flu shot this past October and had a terrible reaction to that, too. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her system. She has had a flu shot every single year for the past 10-15 years and she has never had a reaction at all. She received the regular flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office in Oct2020 had a terrible reaction, she had severe pain in her arm where they gave her the shot, the pain wasn&#39;t at the injection site, the shot was high up the arm, her arm was numb and she couldn&#39;t raise it; she had muscle problems with the arm, she had trouble with her arm for 6 weeks. She has been taking naproxen sodium (ALEVE) for the headache. She has just been treating it symptomatically. No fever and she has just felt cold. The patient stated she really is not sick. She went to pick up dog medicine from the vet and when she leaves her facility, her temperature is always checked when she comes back. She was told her temperature was 97 something. So, she wasn&#39;t running any temperature prior to the vaccine. The patient was planned for the second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient stated her symptoms are not so severe it affects her breathing or something serious. It&#39;s just a pain in her neck to walk around with a headache. The outcome of the events was unknown.

This exaggerated pain in my feet had me up the entire night and nothing relieved it. I had to walk around and try to ease the pain  but nothing gave me any relief. At 6am I took 2 1/2 gr of Valium and finally fell asleep for 3 hours. I was much better in the morning.

About six days after the patient had her second COVID shot, the patient experienced shivering and tiredness. It was reported that the patient had shrunk a little bit starting on an unspecified date.  At the time of the report, over the last 3 days, the patient experienced the side effects. &#34;It could be from something else. She could have gotten something. She did not know.&#34; The patient also had a fever a few times. The patient would go between shivering and really hot so she would take her temperature. The patient did not normally have a fever. When the shivering came on, she was trying to cook, and could not hold the spoon in her hand. The patient did not know what was wrong, but she was cold. All she wanted to do was sleep. The only symptom she still had was being tired. The night before the report, the patient woke up so warm and was sweating; her pajamas were damp. The patient could not sleep in them, so she had to go change. The patient has not shivered since then. The tiredness was persisting. The patient slept on and off all day today, but she was feeling better in general. The patient took her temperature every day. &#34;The highest her temperature got was 100.&#34;
