A 90-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left arm, on 18Feb2021 at 10:50 AM, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including type 2 diabetes diagnosed years ago), and obesity. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Jan2021 at 90 years of age for COVID-19 immunization. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. About a week ago (Mar2021), the patient started experiencing delusions and hallucinations. The patient was currently hospitalized. These came on quickly, no definitive diagnosis. Over the last 2 months (2021), the patient slowly started slurring speech to the point where it was very slurred. In 2021, they took her to the emergency room (ER) and they did a battery of test including computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood test, urine, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain. They were thinking maybe she might have had a small stroke but did not find anything. On Sunday (14Mar2021; within the last 2 weeks), the patient also had brain fog, and a little confusion, but was still there. The patient had no cognitive issues of any sort. On Tuesday (16Mar2021), the patient called and said there were some men at her house. The patient had the police go over and they said there was no one there and she started to say other things that did not make sense. On Wednesday (17Mar2021) at 03:00, the patient&#39;s granddaughter got a call from EMS that the patient reported someone broke into her home, stole her TV, and raped her. This was not true. By Wednesday (17Mar2021), the patient was in full blown psychosis with hallucinations, and delusions. The patient was hospitalized on Wednesday (17Mar2021) and the delusions, psychosis and hallucinations began between Sunday to Wednesday (Mar2021). The patient&#39;s granddaughter believes it all occurred after the vaccine. It was around the same time frame. The patient&#39;s granddaughter would notice a word here and there where the patient was slurring. The patient&#39;s granddaughter did not know if the patient was being lazy or tired and it gradually progressed. The patient&#39;s current state is in a very bad spot - cognitively, she is very bad (started on an unspecified date). The patient now has aphasia and extreme lethargy from 18Mar2021, and dysphagia from 22Mar2021.  This has all progressed since she has been in the hospital. The psychosis came out of nowhere. The patient was on a whole laundry list of medications and does not know if they were relevant to this. The patient had just recently started experiencing some extreme changes to herself to the point where she is hospitalized. The medical team is not finding anything wrong with the patient medically. The patient has developed some psychosis and there is nothing else that has happened that would have caused it. The patient had both doses of her COVID-19 vaccine. The patient&#39;s granddaughter was trying to research it to see if has been reported by anyone else. The patient&#39;s granddaughter considered the events as non-serious. The patient had not recovered from the events.

This went on  for 4 days (until 1/31/2021).  She called a nurse at her facility morning of 1/31/2021, who told her it was most likely a side effect from the vaccine.   My mom did not feel reassured and called the front desk at her facility.   Eventually 911 was called, the paramedics came afternoon of 1/31/2021 and they told her her blood pressure was not quite right, and if she wanted to go to the hospital.  She said no.   She was less upset though.   She still didn&#39;t feel &#34;normal&#34; until 2/2/2021.  She is prone to panic and PTSD if things don&#39;t feel right.

Blood pressure, pulse and respiration were absolutely normal. But she was unable to speak for the rest of the day, she would open her mouth but could not get any words out. She also was extremely fatigued and slept most of the day, had no grip in her hands and was very stiff when she was able to get up. Had a slight fever, which went down after taking 1/4 of a Tylenol.  No pain in the arm at the injection site and also no redness or swelling.  So the know side effects of fatigue and muscle/joint pain hit her very hard.   She is much better today, 24 hours after experiencing the side effects.

She was drooling and staring vacantly and was not responding to questions. This lasted for a bit. I called the ambulance which took her to the  hospital. They hydrated her and sent her home with no idea what caused it. The next day she was sitting on the toilet and passed out with her eyes closed. She started drooling. I again called the EMTs and they came. She had come to and they said she fainted and it was probably because she was having a bowel movement. This has not happened before or since these two episodes. I do not know if she should get the next shot.

Patient also mentioned she developed a bladder infection for which she was taking antibiotics. Patient had Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021, about 5 days ago. Patient followed instructions before vaccine. Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn&#39;t have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn&#39;t remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days. Doctor wanted her to get a urine test, but she couldn&#39;t urine, patient tried for a long time in the bathroom and only got a few drops of urine out and it was brown. Not normal urine. Next day patient called 911. She wanted to be assured she was not dying at home. Did have room available at the hospital. Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again. Really thought she was burning up. Patient didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital and suffered at home. Next night and third night was so bad. Patient couldn&#39;t urinate anymore. She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn&#39;t miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn&#39;t urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn&#39;t handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn&#39;t sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn&#39;t think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn&#39;t get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty. Had so much constipation for a long time and tried to correct it with mediation. Medication was too strong and gave her diarrhea. Doctor thought maybe she had colon cancer. Stopped the medication. Wasn&#39;t 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg. Provided: V11496, MSRS 53041 REV 0417, and 883928. Patient no longer has constipation. Now it is the opposite. Now bowel movements are soft and pasty. Patient tried a stool softener that didn&#39;t work, was worthless. Was over the counter. Patient didn&#39;t take stool softeners after the COVID-19 Vaccine. All the events started from Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                3/16/2021 Reaction from Pfizer second shot:  I received the second Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, February 23rd, 2021 around 1PM.  Early Wednesday morning I developed Gastric reflux which I never had before. As the day progressed I had severe abdominal pain that lasted throughout the day, also something I never had before. Nausea set in late that evening. Although Thursday was fairly stable, on Friday I developed black diarrhea that continued all day.  By Sunday I was so weak that a nurse came and sent me to hospital via  ambulance. After 4 days of blood tests, transfusions, a chest x-ray, heart monitor, endoscopy and colonoscopy  etc. , the only diagnosis for the significant blood loss was a bleeding ulcer.  This must have been developing on Wednesday when the severe pain began. After release from the 4 day hospital stay, I was sent to our health clinic for 6 days to regain some strength. Since I never had ulcers, I firmly believe that everything was activated on Tuesday when I received the second Pfizer vaccine shot.  Please advise on your perspective of my situation. Is what I have described similar to others who have reported vaccine side-effects?  Thanks and be well.

She said her mother normally doesn&#39;t have headaches. She said her mother began having nose bleeds that started on Thursday (18Feb2021), and continued on Friday (19Feb2021), and Saturday (20Feb2021). She said her mother&#39;s blood pressure was up during that time, as well. She said on Saturday night (20Feb2021) at 9:00 PM she took her mother to the Emergency Room because her mother&#39;s blood pressure was very high. She said a CT scan of her mother&#39;s head was done and was negative for a stroke. She said her mother was kept in the Emergency Room and monitored.

She said her mother was given some orange juice and peanut butter crackers at the time. She said her mother&#39;s stomach became upset then.

She said her mother&#39;s comprehension is not at the same level as prior to being hospitalized. She clarified her mother still drives a car at 92 years old and takes care of her own check book. She said she doesn&#39;t know if her mother will still be able to do that at this time. Reported her mother was checked for a UTI while at the hospital. She said the hospital went ahead and treated her mother for a UTI without knowing if her mother had a UTI. She said because her mother is elderly, a lot of times the elderly have UTIs.

The caller stated she did not have any information on the medications her mother has been given while at the hospital. Reported at first she did not think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with her mother&#39;s first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, but then there was a new part to her mother&#39;s story that made her think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine.

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 92-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered in Arm on 04Feb2021 at 12:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes, arthritis and thyroid, all three for 10 plus years; and bladder. Concomitant medication included ongoing methotrexate and meloxicam taken for arthritis; metformin taken for diabetes; mirabegron taken for bladder; and levothyroxine taken for thyroid, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing.

On Saturday, she wanted to do very little &#39;aero&#39; (word not clear), very little just the minimum. She get up, she had a little breakfast, and as I live near a little pond, she watched the water and birds. And then yesterday, she slept probably five hours during the day and today that is all she has done, she got up and she does not want to eat, she took a nap, she changed chairs and she took a nap. She is now in her bedroom and taking another nap and this is not my mother. The patient was still alive but in failing health since the vaccine. The patient is now bedridden, lost 20 pounds (lbs) and was in constant pain. The patient was fine, walking and even dancing prior to vaccine.  The outcome of the events &#34;Her health has declined each day&#34; was not recovered while unknown for the other events. The patient died from vaccine on 15Mar2021. The autopsy was not done.  Follow-Up (02Apr2021): Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Failing health since vaccine

                                                felling dizziness; nausea; not feeling strong; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 93-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), at left arm on unspecified date in Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization and lubiprostone (AMITIZA) , via an unspecified route of administration from Dec2020 to an unspecified date at 1 DF, 2x/day as laxative..Medical history included:TIA started in Dec2020, bowel problem, fell (she fell about 3 weeks before she got the Pfizer COVID-19 shot) and some memory loss ( not serious).She wanted to know if she should receive her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine if she was presenting the following side effects: felling dizziness, nausea and not feeling strong. She was currently taking Amitiza as a laxative. She believed these side effects were not related to the administration of the first dose of the vaccine and were rather common conditions for her age , she also stated that she did not have any &#34;negative feelings&#34; with the first shot of the vaccine.   Consumer said she had an appointment today for her second shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and got a letter yesterday that said she could get it at 03:00PM today at the center where she got the first vaccination. She said that they gave the shot in her left arm for her first vaccination. She said it was very common at this age that she very often didn&#39;t feel well, and she was on a new laxative that might be causing some upset. She said she had no fever, she was not nauseated, she had no headache, there was nothing wrong. However the outcome of the events was unknown. Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events dizziness, nausea and asthenia cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. Further details about the patient&#39;s medical history, concomitant conditions and the events would be helpful. The contributory role of the concomitant laxative also cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 93-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL1283) intramuscular injection in right upper arm, near her shoulder on 21Jan2021 10:00 AM at single dose for preventative. Medical history and concomitant medication were none. patient reported side effects to the pfizer vaccine after the first dose last Thursday 21Jan2021. Caller reported headache, chills, pain in arm and feeling like she has a fever. Caller stated pfizer should have two dose, one for small people and one for large people. Reporter asked what the timing of the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is and if she could receive it earlier or later than 3 weeks.  Caller stated she received the first Pfizer dose on 21Jan2021 and her second dose is on 18Feb2021. She is calling about the Pfizer BioNtech Covid vaccine. She had the vaccine last Thursday on 21Jan2021. She started having the usual aches, headaches, and pain. On Saturday (23Jan2021) she started getting chills and by the evening she felt warm and feverish, when she checked her temperature it was 98. Last night, she felt like her body was burning up but her temperature was 98. She felt miserable and could not sleep all night. States she attributed it to the vaccine since she was feeling ok prior to the vaccine. She is asking if she should get the second dose. Weight: 95 to 98 pounds, she suggests that those that are smaller like her be given a smaller dose since she weighs so little. She is nervous about getting the second dose which is scheduled on 18Feb2021. She felt like she was burning up and it drained her. She keeps taking her temperature but she does not have a fever. She did not sleep last night. She feels better today. She is aching a bit today but not as much as she did. She is tired since she did not sleep last night. She still has the chills. States it is weird since she feels like she has a high temperature but does not have a high temperature or fever. She hears that there is usually not side effects with the first injection and usually there are side effects with the second injection. She did not feel the vaccine when it was administered. Her chills on Sunday was really bad and today it is better. The burning up/ hot feeling started gradually on Saturday and then on Sunday it got worse. She does not feel as hot and it has improved right now. it was also reported pain in injection site. Relevant Tests was none. no AEs following prior vaccinations. The last outcome of did not sleep last night and tired was unknown, of the events was recovering. It was a non-serious report. Event were not required a visit to Emergency Room nor Physician Office.

A 94-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 (around 3:15 PM to 3:20 PM) at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml dose injection in right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure, cholesterol, blood thinner and fluid. The patient historical vaccine included varicella zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) for immunization. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect as this was the first dose. The patient had no prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included ongoing apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner, ongoing furosemide (LASIX) for fluid, valsartan for blood pressure, ongoing pravastatin for cholesterol. The reporter was calling because her mother had the COVID-19 Vaccine on 07Jan2021, it was on a Thursday. By that Friday (08Jan2021) she was not feeling that well. Caller stated she did not know if what occurred had any correlation to the vaccine, but she wanted to report these details in case this started to be came a problem. Her mother is 94 years old and was in very good shape. However, now she was in the hospital completely disoriented. Since getting the vaccine she had subsequently broke out with shingles two days after getting the vaccine on 09Jan2021. Caller reiterated she was not saying this had anything to do with the vaccine, but she just wanted to reported these events. Caller initially stated it was unknown why patient was admitted to the hospital. She went on to explain her mother, the patient, was complaining of pain and burning. She started complaining of this pain and burning in the evening like around 5PM (on 08Jan2021 17:00). She later broke out into shingles. Caller mentioned patient has not had the SHINGRIX vaccine yet. However, she did have the older vaccine, ZOSTAVAX. Caller confirmed patient received the ZOSTAVAX years before. Patient went to the Emergency Room the first time on 09Jan2021 due to complaining of pain and burning and they could not find anything wrong with her. They checked her vitals and ran several tests and it all came back fine. They then sent her home. Patient went back to the Emergency Room on 10Jan2021 and completed another battery of test, labs, checked vitals, had chest x-ray, and cat scan at this time they could not diagnose with Shingles. On 11Jan2021, the patient had an appointment with her Primary Doctor and he did not find anything wrong. Patient came home with caller&#39;s sister and she was helping her get undressed. That was when the sister noticed a rash on the patient&#39;s body. The rash broke out on her body on Monday 11Jan2021. They tried to call the doctor that night, but did not get a response. On Tuesday 12Jan2021 they took the patient to urgent care and that was when she was formally diagnosed with Shingles. She was started on medication for the Shingles, Acyclovir, and sent home. They also thought she had a slight Urinary Tract Infection. She was started on CIPRO for the urinary tract infection. Patient was home for a couple of days in Jan2021 and she was not getting any better. She was then starting to lose her mental faculties. They thought this was from the urinary tract infection. Caller clarified the patient was then admitted to the hospital on 16Jan2021 due being disoriented. For causality assessment, it was mentioned that it is so coincidental this happened right after getting the vaccine. She was healthy and then it was like a snowball. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Pt has a PMH of dementia (Baseline, she will keep saying, &#34;help me, help me&#34;, AOX3, using walker, could go to bathroom by herself), hx breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy, chemo, Tamoxifen, currently not on tx), HTN, HLD, vaginal bleeding (no further work up by family), overactive bladder (on solifenacin), hx of MI (undocumented, no PCI or CABG), spine stimulator placed. According to patient&#39;s daughter, she saw her January 30, she was doing okay after the vaccine. On  1/31 when the daughter called her on the phone, she knows she has some slurred speech, when she saw patient in the facility, she noticed her gait becomes unsteady.  She decided to bring her to the hospital.  1/30, she noticed the patient has spilled up some water, otherwise denies fever, chills, shortness of breath, pain,  chronically, she has constipations taking laxative.  In the ED, pt was afebrile, 36.1, heart rate 85, blood pressure 130/61, respiratory rate 18, saturations 98 on room air.  Labs shows, sodium 134, potassium 3.6, bicarb 28, BUN 18, creatinine 0.97, glucose 119, WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 11.8, platelet 239.  PT INR 1.09, COVID negative. CT head suggestive of subacute infarct. Possible including small vessel ischemic changes. Chest xray questionable patchy left retrocardiac atelectasis or pneumonia. EKG shows atrial fibrillation&#39;s heart rate 71, QTc 610.  Case was discussed with neurology in the ED, patient was not a TPA or embolectomy candidate. CT head suggestive of acute/subacute cerebellar infarct.  Patient does not have any residual or sensory deficit except expressive aphasia. Neuro saw patient,  mentioned patient appears to have had a stroke that by the CAT scan criteria is already subacute.  The patient was admitted on the stroke pathway.   The patient has new onset atrial fibrillation and therefore should be considered for anticoagulation.  The patient cannot have an MRI of the brain due to her spinal cord stimulator but given that the stroke is already subacute on the CT without any signs of hemorrhagic conversion she could be started on this at this point.  If she gets started on anticoagulation the aspirin should be stopped. If the patient cannot go on anticoagulation or does not want to then she might be a candidate for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention. 2D echo shows normal ejection fraction of the left ventricle estimated at 70 to 75%.  Regional wall motion abnormality was not observed.  Right ventricle systolic function is normal.  Moderate aortic stenosis. Cardio was consulted for anticoagulation,  From cardioembolic prevention standpoint, anticoagulation is recommended to prevent CVA. However, she has significant risks for bleeding given recent vaginal bleeding (investigation not pursued to spare her comfort), age, comorbidities, etc. Again, further discussion between family and primary team is required regarding risks vs benefits. Was evaluated by speech-language pathology present minimal oral dysphagia no overt clinical signs of aspiration, recommended to continue with NDD 2 diet/thin liquid. Patient was discharged to ECF.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

A 95-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3246, expiration date: 30Jan2021) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included walks with a walker, both knees replaced a year ago on 11Mar2020 (prior to receiving the vaccine), she had the mucus in her throat and a little bit of a cough prior to getting the vaccine. She had allergies. She normally has the mucus and cough in the morning when she gets up. She is also blowing her nose a lot. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was starting to get hot and cold. She was unsure if she has a fever as she does not have anything to measure it with. She gets hot and sweaty. She feels good but is hungry and eating like crazy on 09Jan2021. She is talking and breathing fine. Getting hot and cold and hot and sweaty: Happened a few days after the vaccine. She was unsure what day, maybe the day before yesterday, or yesterday and today. Yesterday she took a shower and she also took some guaifenesin (MUCINEX). This made her feel better. For example, she had lunch a while ago and she did not feel like doing anything. She felt lazy. She usually swims at 6 AM Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and she did not go. Her friend said this was not like her. She also did not want to shower yesterday. She kept putting it off and then she finally showered and felt terrific. Her body felt like her body. She has always been a good eater, but since the vaccine she has been more hungry and eating more. Right now, she is starting to get warm as she is talking. It will go away and come back a little while later. Outcome of the events &#39;getting hot and cold&#39; and &#39;gets hot and sweaty&#39; was recovering and not recovered for the other events.

                                                Excerpt taken from patient&#39;s medical record notes.    Recreational Therapist was in room with patient who was at baseline mentation at that time, and was getting patient a cup of tea.  Rec Therapist observed patient to &#34;all of a sudden slouch down toward left side&#34; and became unresponsive.  Therapist called for help, and Registered Nurse (RN) and Certified Nurse Aide (CNA) came into room.  Patient was initially non-responsive and profusely sweating and hot to touch.  Vitals  were taken (see below).  The patient then slowly became responsive after approximately 4 minutes and was visibly nauseous  and appeared like she was going to vomit, but ultimately did not.  Patient was assisted into bed, APRN was called, order for vital signs to be taken every 4 hours for 72 hours, and Electrocardiogram (EKG) to be performed.   EKG results were abnormal, indicative of infarct; APRN ordered transport to Emergency Department.   Patient returned from Hospital ED at approximately 10:45 PM same day (1/28/21), with transfer paperwork documenting  a  Hospital diagnosis of &#34;Syncope&#34; without any additional lab results or any new medication or treatment orders in the documentation.  Follow up the next day (1/29/21) by RN at the Nursing Facility--RN logged into the Hospital medical Charting system, only to find that there was no record whatsoever of the patient being in the Emergency Department on 1/28/21--no notes, no labs, no summary from a practitioner.  Patient recovered and has resumed close-to-baseline activity and functioning.

                                                The above info is available but it is as my mothers....She had a bad reaction ( very flu like for several days). I proceeded with second shot in February....she did not feel well, but just sorta didn&#39;t want to get up anymore. She slept more and more and more. Her appetite declined. I got her up and she was ravenous. She slept more and seemed in a lethargic way to take less and less interest. She was living independently and had been most of her life. We scheduled an internist report. She passed labs with flying colors....... when you are 96 they look at everything as remarkable ( will live for 10 more years). I also was not equating any of this with the vaccine. However, we could not ignore it any longer Saturday the 4-10-21. I took her to ER. She was lucid and walking with difficulty. I took her in by ambulance as she was just saying, &#34;I&#39;m so week!&#34; I&#39;m so whoozie! On Sunday they are talking immediate intensive rehab. Neurologist leave for 5 days and in next 48 hours she becomes 200% less. First delusional, then sleeps all day. He showed me an MRI that to a layperson looked like little hives all over the brain ( I had also gotten hives from somewhere on my skin that I originally equated with Covid but no one thought so. I have also had the two shots.) One week out I was looking at Hospic eand long term care placement. Yesterday they couldn&#39;t get a diagnosis for Hospice ( the person sent to sign her up). I thought what? After all these tests and  maybe it is cardio, maybe it is exchemic  strokes, they don&#39;t have a diagnosis because she hasn&#39;t changed much since 2017? We have to take this totally fine independent  woman and in one week say, &#34;She has Dementia?&#34; It&#39;s possible but what caused it? It&#39;s not age......we live until we are 110. Yes, that MRI showed me little formations of clotting all over ( no major bleed if any in a lobe). Over the last week I have been looking at her health and how we just slowly went downhill. It&#39;s easy to blame a vaccine, but still..........I am saying that there were NO OTHER reasons other than she didn&#39;t seem to tolerate the shots well........first was acute, and the second was long term and slow...........

Everyday after she got 10% better and as of this notice she still isn?t back 100%.. She better than she was but suffering from the effects. She?s not going to get second shot because she says it will kill her. I want her to get it but if the 2nd shot is worse than first I can?t in good conscience let her get it.

A 98-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL8982, expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 12Jan2021 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

She was fine after the injection then 13Jan2021 in the afternoon she had a headache for two hours; that night she was restless and couldn&#39;t sleep; she was so hot she couldn&#39;t keep cool. Then this morning 14Jan2021 her headache is gone but she has a little stomach ache. Mentioned they haven&#39;t brought breakfast by yet and that might help. She was planning to get the next dose of the vaccine 02Feb2021. She has been living in an assisted living facility now for three years; and she can&#39;t get outside; and has not seen her family due to the virus. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in an assisted living facility. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The events did not require a visit to physician or ER. No relevant tests done. Outcome of the events headache, feeling hot, restless was recovered on 14Jan2021; stomach ache was recovering and unknown for the other event.

She also had SBPs up to 170&#39;s  (150&#39;s/90&#39;s on my interview) and is tachy to 140&#39;s in sinus tach. Denies  any caffeine today or anxiety or behavioral contributors today, no pain or  other stimuli. Pt admits she is feeling jittery when she talks with me,  and that taking deep breaths slows her heart rate to 70&#39;s-80&#39;s.  Patient has notable history of cHF with associated LE edema in the past and should strongly be considered as part of this ADE assessment.

They took her home in good spirits and she appeared to be doing well until the evening when she became unresponsive. She developed high fevers and came to the ER with low normal O2 saturations and evidence of sepsis. Blood work showed a markedly elevated white count and an elevated lactic acid of 8 along with an elevated renal function and cardiac enzymes without EKG changes (multiorgan failure). Her COVID test was negative.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated no acute findings but likely chronic fecal impaction.  CT Head was negative for bleed or stroke. At this time is is unclear as to what was the cause of her symptoms but we believe it was presumed bacterial sepsis but this diagnosis is in question as all her cultures were unremarkable. The family opted on comfort measures rather than aggressive intervention and she was sent home with hospice.  Since it occurred so closely after receiving the vaccine I think it was worthwhile to bring it to your attention.

My relationship to the patient is that I am her daughter.

A 98-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right Arm on 17Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9261) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included cholesterol, blood pressure, synthetic thyroid replacement, kidney and breast cancer survivor. Concomitant medication(s) included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL) taken for thyroid therapy, start and stop date were not reported, vitamins,  Cholesterol medication, Blood Pressure medication. The patient previously had a flu shot.  The reporter said her 99-year-old mother received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-; had mild symptoms. Her mom is 99 and in good health. Her dad lived until 110. Her mom had first Pfizer shot through the assisted living facility on 17Jan2021. During routine testing her mom tested positive for COVID 25Jan2021. She had mild symptoms that started on the 26Jan2021. She was tired. Her energy level was gone and she had low fever. For prevention and to stay safe she had monoclonal antibodies infused on 29Jan2021. After that, she got really bad with fever and sweats. She never had trouble breathing. When taking her back from receiving the monoclonal antibodies, her mom had chills and was feeling horrible. They said it was progression of the disease. It took a month for her to get her strength back, but now she is great. She wasn&#39;t strong when she was due for second shot on 07Feb2021 and she didn&#39;t get it because they didn&#39;t want to stress her. She didn&#39;t have any stamina at that point. Now caller has been reading that some people say wait 90 days after monoclonal antibodies for the second dose. Her mom&#39;s thyroid doctor said not to give it. Her mom got better within the month, but would tire easily. She would be spent and couldn&#39;t do anymore. Now she is back to normal. She is up all day and stays up until 11PM.The outcome of the events was not reported.

                                                Received first dose of Pfizer vaccine  in left deltoid on 4/8/21 at 7:30 am.  At 10:00 am, she called her niece and complained of extreme fatigue.  At 12:00 pm, she complained of worsening fatigue and blurry vision.  At 3:40 pm, she complained of loss of appetite but denied fever and chills.  The niece was unable to reach her by phone after 4 pm, so she came over to the decedent?s residence at 6:15 pm to check on her.  The niece found her lying face up in bed ?gasping for air.?  She then became unresponsive and EMS was called.  The decedent was pronounced at 8:11 pm after unsuccessful resuscitative efforts.  Autopsy showed hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with marked partially calcific coronary atherosclerosis; marked pulmonary edema; and pleural effusions.  The brain was saved for neuropathology given the history of blurry vision.
