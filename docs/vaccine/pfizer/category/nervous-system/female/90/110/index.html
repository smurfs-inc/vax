A 90-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer BioNTech) (lot# EL3249), intramuscular in right upper arm, on 14Jan2021 between 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM , at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. She was monitored for an hour after vaccine. Medical history included penicillin allergy, ongoing vascular dementia, cardiac pacemaker insertion, congestive heart failure. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin and experienced drug hypersensitivity and rash (she took the prescribed dose and immediately broke out after, all over her body), codeine and experienced drug hypersensitivity, neomycin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, neosporine and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient experienced aspiration pneumonia in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, wouldn&#39;t eat on 17Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, trouble breathing/couldn&#39;t breathe without oxygen on 21Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, incoherent on 15Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, thrashing around with her legs, would not settle down/legs were thrashing around on 15Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, persistent urinary tract infection (UTI) on an unspecified date in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown. The events were considered serious as caused patient&#39;s hospitalization. Clinical course: on 15Jan2021 night the patient started thrashing around with her legs, would not settle down, she was incoherent. On 17Jan2021, when she woke up, she was completely incoherent and would not eat. On 17Jan2021 she was taken to the emergency room (ER), and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and persistent urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was admitted on 17Jan2021 and she was treated. On 18Jan2021 patient got better, they put her on a bunch of antibiotics. On 19Jan2021 patient walked the halls, she wasn&#39;t incoherent. She was going to get PT/OT, speech therapy. The patient was discharged on 20Jan2021 and was taken to rehab type place (near the hospital), she was fine. However over the night she got worse. She became incoherent again and couldn&#39;t breathe without oxygen (21Jan2021). On 21Jan2021 the patient was sent back to ER due to trouble breathing. The reporter stated that something happened at nursing home and the patient went bonkers. She was admitted again (still ongoing) and put to intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac function test: nothing wrong with heart in Jan2021, chest x-ray: concerning for possible Covid pneumonia on 17Jan2021 (transvenous pacemaker is present some peripheral, increased entity present Concerning for possible COVID pneumonia), CT scan: no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax in Jan2021, COVID-19 virus test: negative in Jan2021 (2 times during the ER trips). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with unspecified antibiotics.

                                                kidneys weren&#39;t acting/kidney issues; not having the feeling to urinate; Light-headed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (reported for herself). A 91-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and blood thinner. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner. The patient is asking if there were any reports of adverse events with kidneys and the vaccine. She received the 1st shot last Thursday (07Jan2021) and told that yesterday (10Jan2021), she had an episode where kidneys weren&#39;t acting. She also mentioned that she is on a blood thinner, ELIQUIS. She is due to receive the 2nd shot on 28Jan2021. She said that she wouldn&#39;t want to receive the 2nd dose if this was related to her adverse reaction. The issue with the kidney started after on 10Jan2021, yesterday she was really having problems, she went to church then came home by that time she would have to go to the bathroom, but she did not go, she ended up cooking dinner which was 3 hours later, she was noticing that she was not urinating. She drank some Gatorade and that made it little better, she is wondering if it&#39;s a side effect. On 10Jan2021, when she noticed the kidney issues, she did not know for certain if it started before that, she didn&#39;t pay attention. Also, yesterday (10Jan2021), she got sick in which she had to grab the counter, she felt bad, she wasn&#39;t dizzy, but felt light-headed. The symptom of not having the feeling to urinate had improved a little today but she is concerned and wanted to know if this was a side effect. Her being light-headed only occurred on 10Jan2021, it was a onetime occurrence yesterday. However, she was also just sitting around, laying around, after that yesterday. The outcome of the event &#39;light-headed&#39; was unknown; while outcome of other events was recovering.

                                                She had the vaccine on Thursday and no visible side effects. On Saturday she was very weak and had to be lowered to the ground. She was drooling and staring vacantly and was not responding to questions. This lasted for a bit. I called the ambulance which took her to the  hospital. They hydrated her and sent her home with no idea what caused it. The next day she was sitting on the toilet and passed out with her eyes closed. She started drooling. I again called the EMTs and they came. She had come to and they said she fainted and it was probably because she was having a bowel movement. This has not happened before or since these two episodes. I do not know if she should get the next shot.

On February 18th, 2021 she visited her doctor with numbness in her hand. They thought it may be carpal tunnel and sent her home. The morning or March 18th , 2021 she had a severe stroke and was transferred to Hospital and then to other hospital. She was in the hospital until Tuesday March 23rd when she was transferred back to her home for hospice care. She died on March 26th, 2021.

This 91-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included high blood pressure, kidney cancer, cancer in her bladder 20 years ago and coughing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), ascorbic acid (VIT C), losartan potassium for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate for blood pressure, amlodipine for blood pressure, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81). Patient had cancer in her bladder 20 years ago. That was taken care of. Had kidney cancer because her husband used to smoke and blow it in her face. Had rare type of kidney cancer. It was removed. Treated for bladder cancer. Patient has had no problem ever since and that was more than 18 years ago. Patient had a fever, headache, and was very tired. Burning up on side of the body and she got all wet. This was not normal and she felt like she was dying. Patient stated she had shingles and developed post herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had pain at the bottom of her foot but it was getting worse after she received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Patient noticed the liquid going thru arm to chest and in straight line to her leg, like a science fiction movie with an injection of some kind. The doctor thought the vaccine might have an impact on the nervous system and spike the symptoms of post herpetic neuralgia. Patient spoke to her doctor but nobody knows anything. Nobody was willing to help her. Patient felt like she was dying. She didn&#39;t want to die. Patient feel the symptoms are getting worst. She was burning up inside. Her pain was around the bottom of the foot now it&#39;s on top of the foot and goes up to knee. Patient was not blaming anybody but she thought it was the vaccine. Patient was sweating, wet, perspiring all night. The symptoms usually occur at night. Patient wanted to know if these symptoms were associated with the vaccine. Patient also mentioned she developed a bladder infection for which she was taking antibiotics. Patient had Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021, about 5 days ago. Patient followed instructions before vaccine. Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn&#39;t have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn&#39;t remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days. Doctor wanted her to get a urine test, but she couldn&#39;t urine, patient tried for a long time in the bathroom and only got a few drops of urine out and it was brown. Not normal urine. Next day patient called 911. She wanted to be assured she was not dying at home. Did have room available at the hospital. Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again. Really thought she was burning up. Patient didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital and suffered at home. Next night and third night was so bad. Patient couldn&#39;t urinate anymore. She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn&#39;t miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn&#39;t urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn&#39;t handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn&#39;t sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn&#39;t think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn&#39;t get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty. Had so much constipation for a long time and tried to correct it with mediation. Medication was too strong and gave her diarrhea. Doctor thought maybe she had colon cancer. Stopped the medication. Wasn&#39;t 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg. Provided: V11496, MSRS 53041 REV 0417, and 883928. Patient no longer has constipation. Now it is the opposite. Now bowel movements are soft and pasty. Patient tried a stool softener that didn&#39;t work, was worthless. Was over the counter. Patient didn&#39;t take stool softeners after the COVID-19 Vaccine. All the events started from Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.

She said the first couple days her mother was fine after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said on Thursday, 18Feb2021, her mother had a pretty severe headache come on. She said her mother normally doesn&#39;t have headaches. She said her mother began having nose bleeds that started on Thursday (18Feb2021), and continued on Friday (19Feb2021), and Saturday (20Feb2021). She said her mother&#39;s blood pressure was up during that time, as well. She said on Saturday night (20Feb2021) at 9:00 PM she took her mother to the Emergency Room because her mother&#39;s blood pressure was very high. She said a CT scan of her mother&#39;s head was done and was negative for a stroke. She said her mother was kept in the Emergency Room and monitored.

She said her mother was given some orange juice and peanut butter crackers at the time. She said her mother&#39;s stomach became upset then. She said she thinks her mother&#39;s stomach upset had more to do with having the orange juice and peanut butter crackers than anything else. She said her mother has never had nose bleeds or headaches before. She said her mother has blood pressure issues that she takes blood pressure medicine for. She said she thinks the COVID-19 Vaccine may have exasperated her mother&#39;s issues. Reported on Sunday (21Feb2021), her mother didn&#39;t seem much better to her.

She said her mother&#39;s comprehension is not at the same level as prior to being hospitalized. She clarified her mother still drives a car at 92 years old and takes care of her own check book. She said she doesn&#39;t know if her mother will still be able to do that at this time. Reported her mother was checked for a UTI while at the hospital. She said the hospital went ahead and treated her mother for a UTI without knowing if her mother had a UTI. She said because her mother is elderly, a lot of times the elderly have UTIs.

The caller stated she did not have any information on the medications her mother has been given while at the hospital. Reported at first she did not think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with her mother&#39;s first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, but then there was a new part to her mother&#39;s story that made her think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine.

                                                felling dizziness; nausea; not feeling strong; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 93-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), at left arm on unspecified date in Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization and lubiprostone (AMITIZA) , via an unspecified route of administration from Dec2020 to an unspecified date at 1 DF, 2x/day as laxative..Medical history included:TIA started in Dec2020, bowel problem, fell (she fell about 3 weeks before she got the Pfizer COVID-19 shot) and some memory loss ( not serious).She wanted to know if she should receive her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine if she was presenting the following side effects: felling dizziness, nausea and not feeling strong. She was currently taking Amitiza as a laxative. She believed these side effects were not related to the administration of the first dose of the vaccine and were rather common conditions for her age , she also stated that she did not have any &#34;negative feelings&#34; with the first shot of the vaccine.   Consumer said she had an appointment today for her second shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and got a letter yesterday that said she could get it at 03:00PM today at the center where she got the first vaccination. She said that they gave the shot in her left arm for her first vaccination. She said it was very common at this age that she very often didn&#39;t feel well, and she was on a new laxative that might be causing some upset. She said she had no fever, she was not nauseated, she had no headache, there was nothing wrong. However the outcome of the events was unknown. Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events dizziness, nausea and asthenia cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. Further details about the patient&#39;s medical history, concomitant conditions and the events would be helpful. The contributory role of the concomitant laxative also cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 94-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 (around 3:15 PM to 3:20 PM) at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml dose injection in right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure, cholesterol, blood thinner and fluid. The patient historical vaccine included varicella zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) for immunization. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect as this was the first dose. The patient had no prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included ongoing apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner, ongoing furosemide (LASIX) for fluid, valsartan for blood pressure, ongoing pravastatin for cholesterol. The reporter was calling because her mother had the COVID-19 Vaccine on 07Jan2021, it was on a Thursday. By that Friday (08Jan2021) she was not feeling that well. Caller stated she did not know if what occurred had any correlation to the vaccine, but she wanted to report these details in case this started to be came a problem. Her mother is 94 years old and was in very good shape. However, now she was in the hospital completely disoriented. Since getting the vaccine she had subsequently broke out with shingles two days after getting the vaccine on 09Jan2021. Caller reiterated she was not saying this had anything to do with the vaccine, but she just wanted to reported these events. Caller initially stated it was unknown why patient was admitted to the hospital. She went on to explain her mother, the patient, was complaining of pain and burning. She started complaining of this pain and burning in the evening like around 5PM (on 08Jan2021 17:00). She later broke out into shingles. Caller mentioned patient has not had the SHINGRIX vaccine yet. However, she did have the older vaccine, ZOSTAVAX. Caller confirmed patient received the ZOSTAVAX years before. Patient went to the Emergency Room the first time on 09Jan2021 due to complaining of pain and burning and they could not find anything wrong with her. They checked her vitals and ran several tests and it all came back fine. They then sent her home. Patient went back to the Emergency Room on 10Jan2021 and completed another battery of test, labs, checked vitals, had chest x-ray, and cat scan at this time they could not diagnose with Shingles. On 11Jan2021, the patient had an appointment with her Primary Doctor and he did not find anything wrong. Patient came home with caller&#39;s sister and she was helping her get undressed. That was when the sister noticed a rash on the patient&#39;s body. The rash broke out on her body on Monday 11Jan2021. They tried to call the doctor that night, but did not get a response. On Tuesday 12Jan2021 they took the patient to urgent care and that was when she was formally diagnosed with Shingles. She was started on medication for the Shingles, Acyclovir, and sent home. They also thought she had a slight Urinary Tract Infection. She was started on CIPRO for the urinary tract infection. Patient was home for a couple of days in Jan2021 and she was not getting any better. She was then starting to lose her mental faculties. They thought this was from the urinary tract infection. Caller clarified the patient was then admitted to the hospital on 16Jan2021 due being disoriented. For causality assessment, it was mentioned that it is so coincidental this happened right after getting the vaccine. She was healthy and then it was like a snowball. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.

Pt has a PMH of dementia (Baseline, she will keep saying, &#34;help me, help me&#34;, AOX3, using walker, could go to bathroom by herself), hx breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy, chemo, Tamoxifen, currently not on tx), HTN, HLD, vaginal bleeding (no further work up by family), overactive bladder (on solifenacin), hx of MI (undocumented, no PCI or CABG), spine stimulator placed. According to patient&#39;s daughter, she saw her January 30, she was doing okay after the vaccine. On  1/31 when the daughter called her on the phone, she knows she has some slurred speech, when she saw patient in the facility, she noticed her gait becomes unsteady.  She decided to bring her to the hospital.  1/30, she noticed the patient has spilled up some water, otherwise denies fever, chills, shortness of breath, pain,  chronically, she has constipations taking laxative.  In the ED, pt was afebrile, 36.1, heart rate 85, blood pressure 130/61, respiratory rate 18, saturations 98 on room air.  Labs shows, sodium 134, potassium 3.6, bicarb 28, BUN 18, creatinine 0.97, glucose 119, WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 11.8, platelet 239.  PT INR 1.09, COVID negative. CT head suggestive of subacute infarct. Possible including small vessel ischemic changes. Chest xray questionable patchy left retrocardiac atelectasis or pneumonia. EKG shows atrial fibrillation&#39;s heart rate 71, QTc 610.  Case was discussed with neurology in the ED, patient was not a TPA or embolectomy candidate. CT head suggestive of acute/subacute cerebellar infarct.  Patient does not have any residual or sensory deficit except expressive aphasia. Neuro saw patient,  mentioned patient appears to have had a stroke that by the CAT scan criteria is already subacute.  The patient was admitted on the stroke pathway.   The patient has new onset atrial fibrillation and therefore should be considered for anticoagulation.  The patient cannot have an MRI of the brain due to her spinal cord stimulator but given that the stroke is already subacute on the CT without any signs of hemorrhagic conversion she could be started on this at this point.  If she gets started on anticoagulation the aspirin should be stopped. If the patient cannot go on anticoagulation or does not want to then she might be a candidate for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention. 2D echo shows normal ejection fraction of the left ventricle estimated at 70 to 75%.  Regional wall motion abnormality was not observed.  Right ventricle systolic function is normal.  Moderate aortic stenosis. Cardio was consulted for anticoagulation,  From cardioembolic prevention standpoint, anticoagulation is recommended to prevent CVA.

                                                Vertigo last week that stayed for five days; pain at the injection site; 2 stroke like symptoms/ like she was having a TIA (Reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack); Blood Pressure 170/130; Fatigue; Joint ache; Nausea; Vomiting; Fever 100.1; Stress; 2 stroke like symptoms/numbness in her lip; Pervasive aching; Momentary confusion; , like she was having a TIA;  Not able to answer questions; she still has not recovered her strength; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter).  A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

A 95-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 10:15 at SINGLE DOSE in left arm for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) with lot number: EL3249 on 20Jan2021 in right arm. After receiving the 2nd dose on 10Feb2021, the patient became ill on 11Feb2021, while sitting on the toilet, she became nauseous and vomiting repeatedly even dry heaves also then became dizzy and felt a tingling in my face and right hand didn&#39;t feel like the patient could get up on her own so the patient&#39;s son and daughter assisted her to her bed. She didn&#39;t know what was wrong and her daughter thought it was a side effect of the vaccine and called the nurse on call. After arriving at the emergency and was examined the patient was told she was being kept for observation since she had just had the vaccine. The patient was later told she also had a mild heart attack and to her knowledge I never had any heart issues. She could then no longer use her walker to walk because she couldn&#39;t bear weight on her right hand. She was hospitalized for 8 days and transferred to rehab and I&#39;m still in rehab. The events were assessed as serious (hospitalized and disability). The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received treatment for the events.

Next appointment for second COVID-19 Vaccine was 06Feb2021. Caller was concerned. Patient never had a stroke before. The reporter wanted to know if this had been previously reported. Saturday night was when patient&#39;s speech began slurring. The patient had the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine that afternoon. EMS didn&#39;t take patient to the hospital on Saturday night, just took vitals and left. Patient&#39;s speech was going in and out.

Ambulance was called and patient was transported to (health center). CT scan and MRI showed patient had a stroke in the area of the brain that affect speech. Patient had an echocardiogram. Clarified patient&#39;s speech symptoms began on Saturday, 16Jan2021.    Information of lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I am the discharging physician and did not admit her but based off the information at admit: the patient received her Pfizer vaccine and developed nausea during her observation time but it was not significant enough to cause concern for the family. They took her home in good spirits and she appeared to be doing well until the evening when she became unresponsive. She developed high fevers and came to the ER with low normal O2 saturations and evidence of sepsis. Blood work showed a markedly elevated white count and an elevated lactic acid of 8 along with an elevated renal function and cardiac enzymes without EKG changes (multiorgan failure). Her COVID test was negative.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated no acute findings but likely chronic fecal impaction.  CT Head was negative for bleed or stroke. At this time is is unclear as to what was the cause of her symptoms but we believe it was presumed bacterial sepsis but this diagnosis is in question as all her cultures were unremarkable. The family opted on comfort measures rather than aggressive intervention and she was sent home with hospice.  Since it occurred so closely after receiving the vaccine I think it was worthwhile to bring it to your attention.

Admitted with diagnosis: Acute Ischemic left MCA stroke. 1/26/2021 Transferred to Hospice care. 01/30/2021 died.  I don&#39;t believe the hospital was aware of her vaccination date as it is not recorded in her records, therefore I assume that a previous VAERS report has not been submitted. My relationship to the patient is that I am her daughter.
