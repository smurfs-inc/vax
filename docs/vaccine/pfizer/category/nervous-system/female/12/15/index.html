                                                Patient was sitting with her mother in front of the pharmacy for the 15 min waiting period after vaccination, and mom alerted us to &#34;something going on here.&#34;  I (pharmacist) went over to the patient and she appeared to be having a seizure, hands clenched, eyes rolled back in head, and she shook a small amount for a short period of time, though mom believes she just passed out.  Mom and I protected head and held her in place, it was over within a few seconds.  A Nurse Practitioner was in the clinic next door and we alerted her. Together, we laid her down, asked her questions, took pulse with pulse oximeter and blood pressure. All seemed within normal range.  We called 911 due to appearance of seizure.  Rescue squad came and evaluated her.

She had a pulse the whole time, BP was 117/60- when I checked it about 5 min later.  Her temperature on a ear thermometer was 99.7.   After she awoke,  she was still very dizzy and stayed in bed most of the day.  5/17/21 AM- she woke up for school 0600- and was feeling better.  No more dizziness, color was back in her cheeks, was able to eat and left for school.

Patient felt fine immediately after the vaccination and was instructed to sit and wait for 15 minutes. The immunizer, watched the patient sit down in a chair. A few minutes later the mother of that patient began screaming help, help. Patient had fainted, falling on the floor and hitting her head. I ran our to assist patient, I instructed my technicians to call 911. Patient was on the floor, shaking. I assisted her in rolling over. When she came to I helped her control her breathing and take deep breaths. I used I gauze pad to stop the bleeding on her head. I made sure she was lying flat on the floor. We gave her an ice pack to help with the numbness and tingling in her hands. The paramedics arrived and took patient to the hospital.
