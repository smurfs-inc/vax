                                                A 12 years old female patient accompanied by mother to receive firs dose of Pfizer.   When the pharmacist tried to administer the vaccine, she noticed the arm muscle was tensed and experienced a bit of difficulty to penetrate the needle in to the arm.  Once the needle inside,  the pharmacist tried to inject the vaccine in and noticed the plunger moved a bit and then stopped.  She tried to use a bit of force to push the vaccine in further but it did not work.  So the pharmacist pulled the injection out and attempt to administer again.  She did inform patient&#39;s mother that she has to try again.  This time the injection went well and as precaution,  the pharmacist did not inject all the vaccine in since she knew the patient got a bit of the vaccine in on the first time.   Mother was advised to give patient a dose of Tylenol or Ibuprofen that night (if patient is not allergic to those meds) to help out with the soreness.  Mother came back to store the next day to ask more questions but there was another pharmacist on duty.  That pharmacist did explain to patient&#39;s mother the mechanism of vanish point syringe and how it is supposed to work.  He relayed the message with the administering pharmacist to follow up.   The administering pharmacist called on Friday (May 21) but could not leave the message.  She tried again on Saturday (May 22) and was able to explain in detail what happened that day.  Her concern is the possibility of her daughter getting double dose and the long term effect of the vaccine.  Pharmacist did ask how the patient doing  and exhibits  any noticeable or  severe side effects beside soreness.  Mother said so far she is ok besides sore arm.   Pharmacist advised mother to monitor the child for a few more days to be safe and call the pharmacist or even her pediatrician if there is further concern.  Pharmacist also will follow up with mother to check on how the patient is doing

                                                I just saw a 12 year old in the office who has an odd rash that started the day after she got her first COVID vaccine (Pfizer). She started with the two on her right ankle the day following the vaccine, then the two on her left ankle started the next day, followed by one more on her distal left arm over each of the next three days. She says the burn slightly when she touches them but no itching, not otherwise painful. They look to me like burns or something similar. I wonder if they are self-inflicted but she denies causing them or anything new recently aside from the vaccine. She has been using neosporin occasionally since they were noted, no other treatments.  Other vaccine reaction noted: fatigue and slightly sore arm. She just completed a course of clinda for strep on 5/5. Otherwise just takes vitamin D daily. No recent open water swimming, etc.

Her eyes looked like they were glazed- not responding; didn&#39;t look bright. She got some water and an ice pack on her back and removed her shoes and put her feet up. After drinking the water and keeping the ice pack on for the rest of those 15 minutes. Nurses were there watching her. And she was able to walk out of the clinic on her own power. It had looked like she maybe would have passed out without the intervention of water, ice pack and getting her feet up.  She had muscle pain in her arm (of injection site)  that day and into the next day. The muscle pain in her arm lasted for about 24 hours.

A 12-years-old female patient of weight 40.816 kilograms and height 147 centimetres received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0175; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 23May2021 as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included vitamin D no&#39;s (VITAMIN D) and elderberries. The patient&#39;s mother reported that her daughter who was 12 she had COVID Vaccine on Sunday and on 24May2021, she was feeling numbness in her nose. She felt numbness in her forehead but that went away, but her nose was still numb. She knew she read through the symptoms and that was not one of them, so she was just wondering if it was like allergic reactions or was that part of the symptoms. The patient was treated with Tylenol and Ibuprofen. The patient is going to get the second dose of vaccination on 13Jun2021. On an unspecified date in 2021, the patient had recovered from numbness on the forehead and was not recovered from numbness on the nose.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.   Follow-up attempts are possible. Further information is expected.

Doctors.  &gt;reached over 110%  immunity if not more.  &gt; Both Hematologist I spoke with plus the E.R. doctors determined she was at 100% immunity with just the first dose. &gt; Due to her reaction her Oncologist/Hematologist are communicating with other hematologist in the U.S.  about a reaction of a ?12 year old pediatric patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis?, further research will begin according to the Director of Onoccologist/Hematologist in the next few weeks to help other pediatric patients with Heriditary Spherocytosis in the U.S., the main point of this research is determining that one dose of Covid vaccine reaches 100% immunity vs 2 doses which would be equivalent to ?2 doses plus 2 booster shots of Covid vaccine? to someone with hereditary spherocytosis.  &gt;  &gt; After 8 hours of going through this, she was able to walk and stand. She was back to her old self.  &gt; If you can please reach out to CDC and let them know about a 12 year olds patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis  reaction to second dose of Phizer Vaccine.

A 12-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number and Expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, on an unknown date (at age of 12-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was not reported. On an unknown date, the reporter stated her 12-year-old got the vaccination and she was fine except a sore arm.

                                                The night of the vaccine, towards the middle of the night she had a fever 103.2; little bit of a headache. Her fever went down through the night. In a.m., she was at 100 degrees. She started shaking and fainted when getting ready to go downstairs; Pulsometer - 147 for heart rate. She shook just a little. I thought she was going to have a seizure and I yelled for my husband and she regained consciousness. She hasn&#39;t had a fever since but we can&#39;t keep her heart rate down -it shoots up from 130- to low 150&#39;s. Still like that today. we took her to Dr. - he said it was reaction to vaccine. He referred her to cardiologist with an urgent designation. She&#39;s never had nay problems like this before. She will see cardiologist tomorrow. Rest and hydration is the current treatment. It hasn&#39;t gone away in the two or three days that they thought it would.

                                                Beginning Thursday night, fever onset reached 101. Patient reported extreme fatigue but aches and sore arm made sleeping difficult. By 2 am on Friday, June 11th, vomiting and diarrhea began. Patient was given 200 mg of Tylenol and 25 mg of Benadryl. Arnaca gel was applied to the rash that formed on the vaccine site. The rash was approximately 3 cm wide and 5 cm tall oval shape. It was bright red and painful to touch (like a sunburn). Arm was also swollen from shoulder to elbow. Patient slept from 4 am - 8am on 6/11. All day on 6/11 patient had trouble keeping down fluids (tried water, juice, gatorade, and broth) and patient refused food (tried popsicles, rice, bananas, scrambled eggs, and plain noodles). Patient complained of throbbing pain in left arm. Patient refused to massage the area and would screen in pain and cry with tears if mom touched it at all. Cold packs and warm packs brought no relief. Patient continued to receive Tylenol every four hours. Fever would reach 102-102.5, break with sweats. Patient reported feeling very cold and then very hot. Fever break would last 30 min - 1 hour before climbing again.   Sunday 6/12 continued the same as 6/11. Patient began alternating Advil 200 mg with Tylenol every four hours. Advil didn&#39;t seem to help any more than the Tylenol did.  Parent called consulting nurse and was advised to take patient to urgent care where she received anti-nausea medication.  Monday 6/13 patient continues to have difficulty with food and drink. The phenergan meds help with nausea but make patient so tired, there&#39;s little chance to get patient to eat or drink. Vomiting has stopped but diarrhea continues.

                                                After the second dose she had immediate pain at the injection site and over the next 24 hours she developed: A fever of 101.4 severe abdominal pain and chest pain that made her feel like her heart was being pulled out painful electric shocks down her neck and spine that made her walk hunched over numbness and swelling in the arm she got the shot pain in her fingers and toes that turned white and were ice cold to the touch  Over the next 2.5 months her abdominal, muscle and nerve pain became unbearable plus she developed new symptoms:  Fatigue gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting Eventually she couldn?t even swallow food or liquids without immediately spitting it up. An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

I gave her 2 small bottles of water, pb crackers, 3 hard candies &amp; elevated her feet. Mom said we didn&#39;t need to get medical attention. After about 10 minutes she was still very lethargic &amp; mom said yes to EMS when asked again. Another mom came over &amp; helped us lay her on the floor to elevate her feet above her head. Her husband came in &amp; assessed patient. Her pulse was 60 &amp; when he asked her to squeeze his fingers &amp; press against his feet it was week. She told us that she hadn&#39;t eaten a full meal since the night before, only had watermelon as a snack. The ambulance came &amp; took her.

Mom and I protected head and held her in place, it was over within a few seconds.  A Nurse Practitioner was in the clinic next door and we alerted her. Together, we laid her down, asked her questions, took pulse with pulse oximeter and blood pressure. All seemed within normal range.  We called 911 due to appearance of seizure.  Rescue squad came and evaluated her.

She was nervous upon receiving her vaccine and after the shot was administered she stated she feels a little warm. The vaccinating pharmacist told her to sit and wait in the sitting area for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. A couple minutes after her vaccine was administered the girl started not feeling well and fainted in the store and her father caught her. We immediately called 911 and checked in with the young girl. The ambulance came and did a physical exam. They offered to take her to the hospital but the patient declined. Patient left the store shortly after with her father.

                                                Patient received her 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine around 11:20am, and started feeling bad within about 5-7 minutes of administration.  Her grandmother came to the counter to alert me that she wasn&#39;t feeling well, patient was lightheaded and just &#34;felt bad&#34;.  She did say she was nauseous, but was very agitated and had trouble verbalizing what was wrong.  She was very hot and clammy, her mother reported that she looked very pale.  I went to get a cuff to take her blood pressure, but by the time I got it on her arm, she was slumping significantly in the chair, so we decided to move her back to the clinic room to lay her down and elevate her feet.  Her mother and I each took an arm to move her.  I thought she may have briefly lost consciousness, her legs were not holding any of her weight, but her head was down, so I couldn&#39;t tell if she was alert.  We moved her a few more feet into the room and her mother moved to set her down in a chair, she was talking and alert.  At this time, her bladder evacuated and she vomited, her mom moved her the rest of the way to the chair. I immediately went back to the room with them and dialed 911 at 11:34am.  She was more alert at this time, did not report any difficulty breathing or any swelling or itching of the mouth or throat.  She was very anxious/agitated, but she did say that she felt a little better after vomiting.   EMS arrived at 11:52, I believe she vomited again before they got here, she did take a few sips of water.  EMS left at 12:06pm, the patient and her mother left at 12:07, she was walking on her own, with support from mom.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

While being escorted by parent and staff, the patient fainted and was supported to the ground. Epinephrine was administered and 911 was called. Paramedics arrived shortly thereafter and examined patient. Patient was cleared by paramedics and walked out of the clinic unassisted.

                                                On Sunday 5/23/2021 my daughter woke up to swelling, redness &amp; pain of the 1st metatarsal of her left foot.  One Monday 5/24/21 the swelling and symptoms in that region had resolved however throughout the day her right hand started to swell, become red and hurt.  This  the throughout the thumb and pointer finger region of her right hand.  The swelling and redness  spread further and could be seen on both palms just below the pointer finger as well as the top of her left foot.  A visit to the doctor was completed on Sunday evening 5/24/21.   The provider we saw believes it to be some for of reaction but it couldn&#39;t be determined if it was environmental, antibiotic or vaccine related.  She was given 2 Benadryl 25 mg tablets after the medical appointment.  As of this morning 5/25/21 I administered anther 25 mg Benadryl and instructed her to take a second dose around 11am at school.   She is reporting there is still swelling in her hand but it doesn&#39;t hurt as bad as it did yesterday.  Her PCP contacted my via phone today and is discussing her case with pediatric rheumatology as she also feels it could be a sign of allergic reaction but since much of the swelling is near joints she has reached out to them and I am waiting to hear back.

He reports that she fainted but had some seizure-type activity, but minimalized. She was monitored by both RN and myself. She was lowered to the floor to lay on the floor, was fanned, and her BP and pulse were monitored by RN. She was accompanied by her mother, and her mother declined having EMS contacted. Once patient regained consciousness, she was alert, laughed and talked to us, and regained a sitting position. We then gave her cold water to drink, and she was able to get up into a chair. After sitting for several minutes, she was able to walk out of the room and into one of our monitoring cubicles for an extended monitoring timeframe. We kept her here for 30 minutes for further observation, then left accompanied by her mother. Due to RN&#39;s report of the seizure-type activity, mom is going to contact patient&#39;s pediatrician to see if further treatment is needed.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer reported that his daughter received the first dose of the vaccine and then was called and they stated that they made a mistake and it was an overdose. The pharmacist told him that when mixing the vaccine they used less of the diluent and more of the vaccine. He stated he was scared because overdose sounded like something is wrong. He also stated he spoke with the primary care physician and they said they do not know and do not recommend the vaccine for a 13 years old and told him to call Pfizer. His daughter said she had pain and at that time he gave her some medicine, some Tylenol she feel little bit eased, she seemed okay. Every time she had pain and then the Tylenol kicks in and it helps but the second thing is he cannot understand why. She had pain at the arm and then body aches on 17May2021 and they gave her Tylenol and that medicine kind of eased her. That is what they did as far as medicine to treat. No further information provided. The outcome of the events body aches and pain in arm was resolving and the other at risk events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She also had a headache and troubles breathing. She had belly pain, as well. On Wednesday, around lunch break she called me to pick her up, she had troubles breathing and headache and feeling blah. Also on the first evening,  Her arm was hurting and her left body side was hurting. (Wednesday this got a little bitter but she still had pain on her front left side -- especially her left leg.)  I took her to primary care and he prescribed Prednisone.  Prednisone started then. On Thursday, she still had troubles breathing and she stayed home from school. On Friday, it was okay for her to go to school.

She wasn&#39;t talking much, she started gagging and fainted again and her body started convulsing.  We believe she was having a seizure.  Patient has never had a seizure, her fever was high.  It only lasted probably 20-30 seconds.  When she stopped, she was able to walk with assistance back to her room.  We quickly gave her some medicine to bring down her fever.  Wet wash cloth and a fan on her.  I failed to take her temperature.  I was too concerned at what was going on.

A 13-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8736; Expiration Date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13May2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was not reported. The patient did not receive any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to covid vaccine. The reporter stated that the day the vaccine was approved [for her age group] she got her initial vaccine. She received her first vaccine dose on May 13th in her right arm, several hours later she began having left arm pain that has progressively gotten worse. She reported that after running her arm was in excruciating pain all the way down to her hand. She further enquired if left arm pain a common symptom of the heart swelling or inflammation of the heart following vaccination or is left arm pain something people have when they had heart swelling or inflammation. She further stated that hadn&#39;t happened the exact same day she wouldn&#39;t connect it so much. The vaccine was given in the right arm, but it is her left arm that is hurting. she called her pediatrician, and he is thinking it is coincidental or thinking maybe she hurt herself, but caller states she doesn&#39;t know but maybe she has a swollen lymph node that is putting pressure on a nerve. The patient took Tylenol for the reported events. Outcome of the events was reported as unknown at the time of reporting.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

                                                sore arm; little fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer via a Pfizer sponsored program. A contactable consumer reported for a 13-year-old female patient who received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 20May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0177) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included athletic induced asthma (she was diagnosed maybe 3 years ago, 2018 or maybe it was 2016) and horseshoe kidney (the patient was diagnosed with a horseshoe kidney a year or two ago, meaning when the patient was in the her mother&#39;s womb, her kidneys while they were developing never separated so she has to be careful not to get kidney infections and not to get hit in the stomach when she&#39;s playing sports). On 20May2021, the patient experienced sore arm, little fatigue. Caller (reporter) stated that there was a report that came out. Caller states her daughter got her first dose, she was 13, and had no reaction other than a sore arm and a little fatigue the first day. Caller states the reports says it&#39;s causing enlarged heart in a lot of teens; she asked her doctor about it and the doctor said the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh the risks and advised the caller to still get it for her daughter. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Pfizer Covid Vaccine: Caller confirms the patient received the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. NDC: Unknown; Expiry Date: Unknown; Unknown Dosage; Indication: Caller states they are pretty good about not going anywhere, but they certainly venture out more than she does. Caller states she wants to make sure she was protected. Caller states she learned a day or two before she scheduled the shot that her daughter&#39;s school is not offering school from home next year. Caller states it&#39;s called E classroom, they are also doing hybrid but her daughter opted to stay home. Caller states she learned they weren&#39;t doing any of that next year. Caller confirms her daughter is scheduled for her second dose on 10Jun2021. PSCC Communication: Report 2 of 7. Caller does not provide any further information on patient; therefore, no further information obtained or verified.  Additional information has been requested.

                                                That afternoon, she was lethargic, achy and her arm was sore, so I gave her Tylenol. She had trouble sleeping that night. On Sunday morning, I gave her two Ibuprofen around 9 because her arm was still hurting. Around 9:30, she came in saying she was having chest pains and her pulse rate was over 120. I took her to the ER. Her heart rate was 128 when they triaged her. They gave her an IV and a saline drip, an EKG and chest x-ray, all of which were fine. Due to her being on birth control, they also did a d-dimer test, which was elevated at 442. They then did a lung scan to rule out a pulmonary embolism. Those results were negative as well. The chest pains resolved around 11 am. Since they ruled out the blood clot and nothing was found to be wrong with her heart, she was sent home. They figured that she maybe had an anxiety attack or heart palpations. I took her to her pediatrician the next day and she was cleared there as well.

We gave her a granola bar and some water before the injection, as a preventative measure. She fainted a second time. Mom checker her BP and patient felt nauseous. She started jerking and 911 was called. EMTs said it was not a seizure, but a vasovagal jerk. Paramedics said to lay the person down after the patient started jerking. When she was stable enough to be moved, EMTs wheeled her to the door of the store.

She never gets nosebleeds, so I took her into the Dr. to have labs done, just to make sure her platelet count was good. All tests came back normal. We are on day 3 after her 2nd Pfizer, and she has not had a nosebleed yet today, so I&#39;m hopeful it&#39;s resolved. In addition to the nosebleed on day 2, she was exhausted, had a headache and had a low grade fever. These I expected, but not the nosebleeds.

I ran over to the girl and she had passed out-she was sitting in the chair and did not fall. She was breathing with a pulse of 77- her color was pasty and she was not responding verbally. She was very limp and did not awake after multiple attempts with  ammonia inhalant, calling her name and rubbing her chest. 911 was called immediately and female was transported to  Hospital within in 20 minutes of incident.  I spoke with her stepmom and she informed me that she was sleeping now and is doing ok.   They did blood work at the hospital and did not find any issues. Step mom states it took 1 1/2 hours for her color to return. She did tell me that stepdaughter has had syncope issues before and is on antidepressant med that may have caused this. We were not aware of this during time of vaccination.

                                                Patient was administered the first Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine per protocol and was seated for observation post administration.  She became faint.  Pharmacy staff  broke an ammonia inhalant to help the patient recover.  She responded quickly, but did require additional whiffs later.  When questioned, she stated that she was having no difficulty breathing, swelling in throat,  and no obvious rash.  She was accompanied by her mother, who  declined emergency medical care/911 assistance.  The patient was not wearing constrictive clothing, so no adjustments were necessary, but she did recline further in the chair.  She was also provided with cool, wet, paper towels for her forehead and neck.  When she was feeling better, she had a few sips of water.  Although offered a motorized cart to leave the store, she left with both parents walking with no assistance.  On 5/20/21 we reached out to the family and spoke with her father.  The patient did have a minor  headache the evening of her vaccine administration, which has resolved.  She does have a sore arm, which is a common side effect of the vaccine,  Her father has reached out to her pediatrician to see whether she should get the second dose or not.  He has not yet received a response.

Her eyes rolled into the back of her head; she then leaned over the right arm of the chair.  Her body stiffened next. I held her head and body with the help of a colleague.  This happened for about 10 seconds, then she woke up and snatched her mask off with a confused look on her face.  We asked her questions to see if she was aware. She was, then she went back out falling over to the side.  I called 911. When she awakened the second time after about 7-10 seconds her face turned pale.  We then moved her to the floor and propped her feet up.  Patient said she was nervous and felt like she had to use the restroom.  Her skin was clamy; patient said clamy skin is nothing new for her.  The fire truck and ambulance arrived on scene.  The workers began to assess patient.  Vitals were good. She did not go in the ambulance, but stated her vision were blurry.  She went home with grandparents.

She was standing in our kitchen at home and became dizzy and started falling backwards. She said her vision was black, she was hot, her head hurt, I could see sweat on her face and chest, and she said she was having tightness in her chest/not able to get full breaths. She didn&#39;t totally lose consciousness, but she was disoriented. These symptoms lasted a few minutes, then she felt fine.

                                                Patient developed dizziness and coldness in extremities. She tried walking and fell down, but did not lose consciousness. She then alternated between feeling hot and cold and seeing &#34;blurry spots&#34;. I noticed her lips turning white and she said she needed to lie down. I got her water and ice packs since she was sweating. We sat on the floor for about 10 minutes, then she was able to move to a chair for another 5-10minutes and then left the facility. Mom reports that she has been lethargic and napping most of the day. Patient ate a few cheez-its for breakfast and reports that she did not get a good nights sleep last night.

A 14-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 (at the age of 14-years-old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced sharp pain in her neck and shoulder and her arm was hurting/ arm pain on 17May2021 night. The reporter was concerned because the pain appeared after a few days and not within 24-48 hours. She asked is this could be an indication that the vaccine was placed in the wrong place like not in the muscle. She asked if this is normal or when the patient should have this checked. The reporter stated that her and her husband did not experience any side effects. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A minute or so later she sat up again, but still seemed very distressed and unable to answer questions. It appeared that she was going to vomit, and then gradually started to become more alert just before the paramedics arrived.  She drank a little water and had some of a granola bar. The paramedics felt that she needed further evaluation, and she was transported to the hospital.

We gave her some glucose tablets and she seemed to get better afterwards.  I did a pulse oximeter on her her and her pulse and oxygen was normal.  I offered mother if she wanted me to call 911 and she said no.  I counseled mother and the girl to monitor how she is feeling and to seek 911 or urgent care if she gets worst throughout the day.  The girl left the store feeling okay.

She started to have an incredible amount of drooling and could not swallow. She then started to have epigastric cramping and sharp abdominal pain that moved into the right lower quadrant. She had pretty severe headache that started the same time as numbness and drooling with photosensitivity. No fever. No vomiting but she was nauseous.  she went to the ER late on 6/13.  She was then transferred to the hospital for furthur care. She had a neurology consult that thought perhaps her headache, numbness and drooling could have been an atypical migraine-this resolved as of 6/14.  Her abdominal pain resolved after appendectomy and now she just has muscular pain related to surgery.

                                                Extreme weakness in her arms and legs; Really bad cough; painful in arms and legs; not been feeling well; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (Parent). A 14-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder on 23May2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. Family history was reported as none, they were basically a healthy family. Patient was not vaccinated within 4 weeks and no additional Vaccines administered on same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. On 23May2021, the patient experienced extreme weakness in her arms and legs, really bad cough, on an unspecified date in May2021, she had severe pain in her legs and on an unspecified date in 2021, she was not been feeling well. Patient&#39;s father called on behalf of his 14-year-old daughter who received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine about two weeks ago and had extreme weakness in arms and legs, 2 weeks ago, on Sunday 23May2021. She had not been to school since then, she went for a couple hours and then they send her back. His daughter also said that it had been painful but caller states that he does not know exactly what his daughter means by that, she said that her legs hurt her, that started probably 24May2021 or 25May2021 with the bad cough also and not been feeling well. Had all leveled out the past 10 days. Had blood work and the results came back Friday. Thought there was an outside chance based on the blood work that it was strep related. Her doctor had suggested that the parents call Pfizer to see if this type of reaction had been reported in her age group after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She never really had a fever. This started the day after the vaccine, and they are not sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. A couple of results were off. The Streptolysins were 468. The antinuclear antibodies were 1 to 160, which was off. Everything else was negative. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included antinuclear antibody: 1 to 160, streptococcus test: 468. Patient received therapeutic measure to treat adverse events, they tried Amoxicillin, which had no impact, they thought maybe it was just a virus. They also tried Tylenol and Advil, which also had no impact. Stated that the Amoxicillin was 875mg twice a day and that the Tylenol and Advil were from different packages lying around the house. Patient was scheduled for the second dose this coming Sunday but they were holding off until she was better. The outcome of events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A contactable consumer (mother) reported that a 14-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Jun2021 (Batch/Lot number was reported as EW &#39;O or 0&#39; 186) at the age of 14-years-old as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. No family medical history of seizure. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on an unknown date at Arm Left for covid-19 immunisation. The reason for the transfer today (03Jun2021) was that her 14 year old daughter immediately after getting her second dose of the COVID vaccine started shaking, experiencing fever and fallen unconscious and collapsed and was taken to the hospital and she wanted to go ahead and report those adverse side effects for her. She (patient) was 14 year old and she got her second vaccination today and few minutes after she got it, she stood up and she said she was not feeling well and then the next thing reporter knew like her eyes go back, she do not seem conscious and she was shaking as if, looks like she was having a seizure and then she fell down and she was not conscious, so she fell down, she is still twitching. She has no history of like seizures but that is like twisting and now she was taken to the hospital. So, the hospital treated her as if she had a concussion. Reporter have reported to them that she looks like it was a seizure before she fell down, into her head. Reporter further stated &#34;That day was her second shot and like I said she stood up, she got up from that, she said that she got funny and that I can see where she just kind of lost consciousness, eyes going back, shaking as if she was having seizures and then she fell down and she was unconscious and she is like still moving as if she is having a seizure and she was taken. Reporter stated, &#34;it was a like a seizure but it is like over and she had concussion like falling on the ground but it appears like a seizure, that was a immediate thing.&#34; For treatment, reporter stated that &#34;Any treatment, No. She was taken to the hospital and the hospital needs to write it down and I don&#39;t understand that, the hospital wrote down concussion but the hospital they took the vital signs and she had low blood pressure.&#34; For the date when patient went to the hospital, reporter stated &#34;That was today, June 3rd and she is discharged. The reason she was taken was potential seizure and it was concussion and it was after she fell, she passed out and had low blood pressure. The outcome of the events was unknown. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The mother assisted patient to the pharmacy waiting area, in which the patient was given chairs to sit on and put feet up. Another shopper who said she was an ER nurse told the pharmacy staff to have the patient lay down across the chairs then left. The patient was weak, cold, clammy, and pale. The patient then told the pharmacist that she had left her mother at the check out section, went upstairs, used the bathroom, was coming down the stairs when her vision started to have black spots. She reached her mother when she said she didn&#39;t feel good and started to pass out. The mother stated she caught her daughter. At this point, the RPH initiated a 911 call.  She called out for the technician to call the store managers for assistance and take over the 911 call. The RPh then stayed with the patient and the mother. The tech gave the mother a bottle of water for the pt. The store managers arrived at the scene and also assisted.  The patient stated she was feeling a lot better after she laid down for a little bit. The RPh notice color coming back into the patient&#39;s lips and face.  The patient stated that the adverse effects didn&#39;t start until she was walking down the stairs. After 10-15 mins, the Paramedics arrived and further assisted the patient and her mother. The paramedics took the patient via stretcher to the ambulance for further treatment around 12:55pm.

                                                Within 2 hours of the vaccine, patient was experiencing nausea and general feeling of unwellness. Within 3 hours, patient had a fever of 99.9. At 11 pm, patient had a fever of 100. Mother administered Tylenol and patient went to bed. Patient woke up around 4:30 am with her whole body shaking uncontrollably. Mother heard her stirring and went to check on her. Her temperature was 100. Mother sat and talked with her and offered a snack, drink, and more Tylenol. Mother checked her pulse, which was normal. Patient was coherent and able to communicate. Mother left the room to get snack and drink and heard something fall over in patient&#39;s room and Mother called out and waited a few seconds for a response. Patient did not respond. Mother went back in the room, as it was unusual for patient not to respond, and found patient sitting back up and placing her head in her hands, stating in a panicked voice that she felt she was going to throw up and that she was very hot and that her head hurt really bad. Patient stated that her ears felt weird and everything went black and she somehow fell over from a sitting position on her bed to laying on her bed and had landed on the dog. Patient was unaware that she had knocked over her water bottle and had no recollection of the loud sound it made as it fell over (unusual because loud sounds are very startling for her). The shaking subsided to a tremor a few minutes after the black out. Patient then reported feeling very cold and her temperature had risen to 101. Patient complained of an extreme headache and continued nausea. Mother took patient to Urgent Care, who performed bloodwork and an EKG, and then referred patient to the Emergency Room for an EEG.  ER repeated EKG and declined to do EEG and told patient to follow up with her doctor in 5 - 7 days.

Patient felt fine immediately after the vaccination and was instructed to sit and wait for 15 minutes. The immunizer, watched the patient sit down in a chair. A few minutes later the mother of that patient began screaming help, help. Patient had fainted, falling on the floor and hitting her head. I ran our to assist patient, I instructed my technicians to call 911. Patient was on the floor, shaking. I assisted her in rolling over. When she came to I helped her control her breathing and take deep breaths. I used I gauze pad to stop the bleeding on her head. I made sure she was lying flat on the floor. We gave her an ice pack to help with the numbness and tingling in her hands. The paramedics arrived and took patient to the hospital.

She also felt tingling in both arms, both hands, her face, and torso; she also had a lot of pain in her back. She felt that her face was hot but to the touch it was not.  After about 20 minutes of these sensations her fingers cramped in gnarled positions that she was unable to straighten. Her right hand fingers was more rigid than her left.  This lasted about 30 minutes and then she was slowly able to straighten her fingers.  By the time she went to bed, around 10 pm, she felt basically back to normal.

Medical work up has been thorough and has resulted negatively, including blood work, UDS, CT Head. She has remained slightly tachycardic, though she has also been moving continuously for several hours. Her physical exam is notable for several indicators of psychogenic origin, including demonstrating variability in tremor frequency (head, legs and arms vacillating it variable rates over time), distractability from motor tasks (head or arms stop shaking when asked to focus on moving her legs, for example). Her speech has also been affected, but this is also variable and she is at times using only 1 word sentences and other times responding more completely. Certainly she may have suffered a psychological stress today as she is fearful of needles and has a history of vasovagal response and her mother notes recent overwhelm with school performance, though this is not unusual for her. If medical work up continues to be negative, it may be reasonable to conclude she is suffering a conversion disorder  &#34;FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Conversion reaction after a Covid 19 vaccine. Patient To be transferred via ground ambulance.&#34;

She has not taken the oral steroids at this time but nearly all of her symptoms have resolved.

She&#39;s recovering perfectly as usual.  She has them occasionally (every few months) but normallly driven by her menstrual cycle which is not coming up and made this uncommon. I just wanted to report it so you have the information.   It could be in the birth defect category below, but I&#39;m not a doctor so not sure and selected none of the above.

We checked her in and (pharmacist ) gave her shot with her mom present at 2 10pm and she was fine with no issues. Within 2 minutes in of her observation period, she started fainting and having seizure like for about 10 seconds, and regained conscious and said she felt dizzy and then blacked out. She was pale and sweating and asked for water. Our shift lead happened to be closed by her chair where she was sitting so she prevented pt from falling down from the chair and called pharmacist for help from inside the pharmacy. Pharmacist rushed to the patient and asked shift lead to call 911. Pt was consious, but lethargic, she could breath normally, no sign of obtruction airway. Pharmacist lift her legs up to opposite chair and started to take BP. Paramedic arrived within minutes and took her vitals which was normal. Mom agreed for paramedic took her out in stretcher to hospital for check up.

Once the patient regained consciousness, the patient was nauseated and vomited.  Minutes later she had another seizure but immediately came out of it.  We asked the patient if this happen to her during the first dose and she said it did not.  The patient does not have a history of epilepsy.  The patient&#39;s mother did say she had the exact same reaction when she had braces put on.  The patient sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes while drinking water.  Before the patient left, we had check up on her and she said she felt completely fine.  I (the pharmacist) called the mother a couple of hours later to check up on the patient.  The mother said she felt fine as if nothing ever happened.  I did recommend to her that her daughter  gets checked up at urgent care today just to be on the safe side.  The mother said she has an appointment with her primary care next week.

                                                She got the second shot of COVID-19 shot around 3 PM on 6/3. She had a sore arm, lower fever, and headache on the second day (6/4), which was expected. On 6/5, she complained about chest congestion in the morning. She described that it felt like running after a mile. I asked her to drink more water and get some rest. The discomfort didn&#39;t get away, so I consulted her pediatrician over the phone. Her pulse and blood pressure were normal (86/103/75). She didn&#39;t feel short of breath. And her finger oximeter result was 99.  In the afternoon, she described the discomfort as after some strenuous exercise and kept putting her hand over her heart. She felt tired and didn&#39;t have a good appetite for lunch or dinner, and only ate half meals. After dinner, around 9:30, she throws up and felt a little better.  Then she took a capsule of Motrin liquid gel of 200 mg ibuprofen and went to bed. She slept well and felt OK this morning.

On June 5th, 2021, Patient experienced fever, fatigue, weakness, and swollen lymph nodes. On June 6th, 2021, Patient continued to have these same symptoms in addition to a break out of several painful genital laisons .  Patient and myself were unaware at this time the sores were laisons, and thought them only to be pimples.  On June 8th when Patient b came very upset because of the pain she was experiencing, I looked at the sores and made an appointment to see her pediatrician right away. Patient visited her pediatrician to have the genital laisons examined on June 8th 2021.  Because the laisons resemble genital herpes sores, they were tested for genital herpes. The test result came out negative. Patient was prescribed antiviral oral medication and topical steroid creams. She continues to take them and still has the sores.

                                                Patient received her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine Friday, June 4th, 2021. One day after the second Pfizer Covid 19 shot, (Saturday, June 5th, 2021), Patient experienced fever, fatigue, weakness and swollen lymph nodes. Two days after the second Pfizer Covid 19 shot, (Sunday, June 6th, 2021), Patient still had those symptoms in addition to the break out of several painful genital laisons. She visited her pediatrician Tuesday, June 8th, 2021, and the laisons were tested for the herpes virus. Patient was also prescribed oral antiviral medication, and topical steroid creams. The results for the herpes test came out negative. Today, June 11th 2021, the  laisons are still present and painful, and continue to be treated.

                                                Patient got her 2nd Pfizer Covid-19 shot at 5:45 PM on Tues 6/8. She had some of the typical side effects the next day- a sore arm, flu-like body aches, a headache and fatigue. In the middle of the night Wed night/Thurs morning at 3AM she woke up with chest pain and difficulty breathing. In her words, her &#34;heart really hurts and it is hurts to breath.&#34; I gave her 1 (500 mg ) capsule of Tylenol. This was the first pain reliever she had received post shot. She also applied Frankincense oil over her heart. Patient was unable to go back to sleep for a few hours because it hurt too much. She did finally fall back asleep in the early morning hours. Yesterday (Thursday 6/10) she reported that she was feeling a lot better. Her heart was still a little painful but by today, Friday 6/11, she says she feels fine.  When I heard on the news about a number of other children between 12-15 who reported heart pain, I thought we should let you all know. I am a little worried that there might be some kind of long term complication for her heart.

A 15-years-old non pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15May2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0182) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included no other illness. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously received Amoxicillin, Azithromicin, Cefdinir, Gardasil(Pf) and had allergy. The patient had Nausea that does not go away with Gardasil. She also received HPV vaccine previously and experienced nausea and the dizziness for a month. Reporter stated, &#34;she did not have any allergic &#39;condition&#39; (not clear) but she was allergic, she had always had a rash when she had this Amoxicillin this antibiotic. She was allergic to Penicillin.&#34; The patient had the COVID Pfizer Vaccine on 15May2021 and as soon as she had her first dose she started to feel nausea and dizziness and from there 5 days later she had, she felt a terrible headache, &#39;this heaviness&#39; (not clarified), headache, dizziness, palpitation. The reporter took her to the emergency room, they did all the test and they didn&#39;t really see anything in the results. From there she cannot stop to have nausea and dizziness and clogged throat so the reporter had to give allergy medication to her every day. She did have, she never had an allergic reaction to any vaccine but the HPV vaccine (captured as unspecified vaccine in tab) what was similar to what she is experiencing now. She had nausea and the dizziness for a month that she couldn&#39;t stay in school and she has this nausea and dizziness and clogged throat she has to run for this allergy medication what normally she never needed. So, she doesn&#39;t want to take this second dose and the reporter was wondering if it is Pfizer because she was just like (Height), a (Weight) pounds if because the reporter understand the vaccine is one for everybody, isn&#39;t this strong for a kid with that height that weight, that you do not needed the second dose. The patient could not she said she will not because she goes to school and she feel the nausea and dizziness and so. The reporter would like to report it because it maybe Pfizer&#39;s that she was thinking that 1 dose would be enough for kids. When asked about the start of experiencing adverse events, the reported stated that &#34;Well the nausea and dizziness, she was a little bit not sure about like headache right after like her we stayed there like half hours because the doctor said to stay there because she has her reaction to which but then we just the reporter felt the nausea and everything was so bright you know, the reporter had the same effect but her went away and the patient after we received she was, the whole day but not too bad, 5 days after then she but she was already with this nausea, dizziness and 5 days after she got the palpitation, bad headache, nausea, dizziness and then I took her to the emergency room.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No they have improved, the only thing now left is every day she has this nausea, dizziness and then she said about dizziness and then nausea and then clogged throat and then the reporter gave her the &#39;allergic pill I gave that, to this allergy&#39; (not clarified further) really she gave only 1 tablet a day.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;On 20May2021, they did a blood test, they did urine test, they did a ECG, so the hospital did all and the doctor too, nothing new.&#34; The reporter had lab test result on chart, she stated they put on her chart but she also had the copy of the results. Okay, here they put the result is a line on the chart. Okay here they put like linear line lab test complete, she get all the line because here they didn&#39;t put results but screen for metabolic and kidney disorder they did, they did an &#39;urinary tract infection&#39; (not clarified) they have marked in the ECG. Okay you going to ask for specific (incomplete sentence).&#34; The patient had no other illness but reporter need to know what Gardasil and Covid 19 vaccine have in common because the symptoms were very similar. Nausea that does not go away. She asked if it is the preservative or what ingredients. Never had a reaction to any other vaccine. She just wanted to call the Medical Department if she should have the vaccine on Saturday or not.

At approximately 10:33 am observation nurse notified charge nurse that another minor patient was having a reaction to the vaccine in the parking lot area.   One of our site specialists was the first to attend to patient. Site specialist stated that she saw the patient walking with one of her guardians in the parking lot and looked like she was about to faint.   Charge nurse hooked up patient to the pulse oximetry and called 911 at approx. 10:34 am. The patient?s O2 level was 83 with a pulse of 107. The charge nurse observed that the patient was under a lot of stress and was hyperventilating and unable to verbalize how she was feeling. Shortly after, the patient fainted due to hyperventilation. Observation nurse advised the patient to calm down and take deep breaths but the patient did not comply and continued rapid breathing. The patient started to vomit and made some gurgling sounds in her mouth and the charge nurse with the help of site specialist laid the patient on her left side. Shortly after, the patient stopped breathing.   Observation nurse administered the epi-pen on the patient?s right thigh. Immediately after administering the epi-pen, patient started to breathe again with an O2 level of 98 with a pulse of 110; but the patient was still unconscious and unresponsive. At approx. 10:36 am first responder paramedics arrived at the scene and took the patient to hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Upon leaving the store approximately 15 minutes after receiving vaccination, patient told her father that she felt she was having an issue with her vision and was feeling faint.  Her father was able to support her as she fainted and was lowered gently to the ground in front of the store.  A pharmacy technician was leaving the store simultaneously and upon witnessing the event ran back to the pharmacy to tell me I was needed to assist.  When I arrived, the patient was alert and breathing and able to answer questions regarding personal information, date, time and location.  Patient stated she felt normal other than some tingling sensation in her hands.  Patient reported that she hadn&#39;t eaten anything since waking up that morning.  EMS was already en route, and I observed the patient until they arrived.  Patient has since been transported to the hospital and is currently reported in stable condition.
