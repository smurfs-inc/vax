                                                Patient in clinic for chief complaint of possible side effect of the covid vaccine which she received yesterday.  She states that she woke up at 0200 with chest tightness, achyness and headache.  She rates the discomfort 7/10 last night and improved now to 5/10.  She denies any worsening with any type of exertion and states that she can do simple things like take a shower, walk across the room, down the street or even stairs without any worsening.  She denies any SOB or chest pain--just feels tight.  Doesn&#39;t feel like she can&#39;t get a full breath or get the air out of her lungs either.  She received her first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday (4:23pm) and had no difficulty with the injection itself and then 9.5 hours later woke up from sleep with this chest tightness as well as achyness and headache.    She states that she had the exact same symptoms when she had positive covid test back in August of this year with the addition of fatigue which lasted for 5 days.  At that time it was not felt necessary to do any further testing nor treat with steroids according to cardiology.  She does have history of LV non-compaction cardiomyopathy and her last visit with cardiology was about 2 years ago and she had a normal EKG and echo only showed &#34;mild LV non compaction at the apex&#34; at that time. He did not need to see her again until she is 18 unless she has problems.  She states that she generally does very well and other than this tightness she does not have any other significant symptoms.

                                                Patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 17, 2021.  On or about Feb. 22 or Feb. 23, 2021, she began to notice trembling in her jaw.  She told me (her mom) about the trembling on Feb. 25.  She had just increased her dosage of Venlaxafine on Feb. 21, 2021, so we actually thought that the jaw tremor was due to that.  As a result, at the direction of her psychiatrist, we began to taper off the Venlaxafine beginning on March 1.  Over time, the jaw tremor was less noticeable.  However, on March 10, 2021, patient received the 2nd does of the Pfizer vaccine.  The next day, March 11, 2021, the jaw tremor was worse than ever.  I can see the tremor - basically, her lower (?) jaw trembles and you can see the trembling in her mouth and chin.  It does not cause pain, and she does not have any other symptoms (no chills, fever, body aches, rashes, difficult breathing, etc.).  We talked to her pediatrician and to her psychiatrist.  Neither one could say what is causing the tremor; perhaps it is the COVID vaccine; perhaps it is the Venlaxafine (she&#39;s not all the way off of it yet); perhaps something else.  However, given the timing of the tremor, and given that the strength of the tremor seemed to get better but then got worse again the day after the 2nd COVID vaccine shot, I wanted to report it.

Patient stated that her shoulder felt like it was burning where she received the injection. She also stated that her face felt numb and her lips felt funny (tingling).  Patient was still able to breathe and respond appropriately to all questions. Care was taken over by Ambulance service. After speaking with patients mother later in the day, it was determined patient had a vasovagal episode.

                                                Fever, chills, extreme fatigue, lightheadedness and very sore arm, but more importantly chest tightness that became increasingly worse over 48 hours. My daughter dealt with the other symptoms but her asthma became less treatable over the two days since the second shot. I finally administered the nebulizer and inhaled steroid today after all other treatments failed to relieve her symptoms. She is doing better but I will follow up with the pediatrician.

Feels dizzy and out of it.  25 minutes after shot having trouble swallowing. No difficulty breathing. Very thirsty.  40 minutes after shot legs feel very heavy. Daughter was sliding them across floor instead of walking regular. She said it was like her legs forgot how to walk.   She was very irritable.  Two hours after shot she said she was feeling  better except for sore arm. Still felt somewhat sick.  Next day she said feels like she had the flu but was feeling much better except for sore arm.

                                                Within 30 minutes after the shot, my daughter had a headache and sore arm.  Other than that she was fine until midnight on Monday  morning  when her tremors increased and spread up from her legs to her torso and arms.  The tremors persisted all day Monday even through her cranio-sacral therapy at Medical Center.  Her therapist tried to calm down the tremors through frequency specific micro current with no success.  Her therapist could tell that her whole system was in &#34;overdrive&#34; which was vastly different than her previous session a week ago.  The tremors were so bad that my daughter wanted her wheel chair again.    I took a video of her tremors after her therapy session. Her therapist told us to contact her DO, Dr. about it.  I did.  She was able to crash around 10pm on Monday.  On Tuesday, when she woke up around 2:30pm, she still had the tremors but they weren&#39;t as severe.  We had a telehealth appt with her sleep neurologist, Dr. at 3pm and showed her the video but she doesn&#39;t recall ever seeing her tremors in the past.    When I spoke to Dr., I shared the video and she was going to discuss it with  the  therapist as they know each other.   My daughter&#39;s tremors have never been this bad.  She had one  major tremor episode in her legs  only over 2 years ago which we attributed to her meds at the time; but again, not this bad ever.

                                                Patient presented for her first COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately a minute after vaccine was given, she was noted to be seated upright in the passenger seat of her car, with head bent forward and eyes open. She was unresponsive, stiff posture, and was placed into a reclined position. She then had some posturing with head turned to the left, no eye deviation or nystagmus, no tonic-clonic movement. Radial pulse was thready, bradycardia was noted, with normal respirations. She was noted to become diaphoretic and pale/ashen color noted to the face and arms. She became responsive within a few minutes, however initially was not able to answer questions clearly. She had no loss of bowel or bladder function. EMS assisted with evaluation.  Initial blood pressure 78/31, HR 54, SpO2 100%.  EMS then transferred her to the stretcher and she was transitioned from her car to the ambulance. She continued to improve spontaneously with BP 94/61 then 103/60 and HR 86 then 74. SpO2 remained stable at 100%.  Skin color improved. She had normal responses to questions, no complaints of headache, dizziness, chest tightness, shortness of breath, numbness or tingling. She had some shaking/voluntary movement of the limbs and body noted, but she could control and stop this voluntarily, no myoclonic or tonic-clonic jerking noted.  After syncopal event occurred, mom reported that the patient has a history of syncope routinely with blood draws and vaccines in the past, however this episode was slightly more prolonged and seizure-like activity was different. She has had some jerking movement previously with syncope which lasts 20-30 seconds, different from today&#39;s response. No known history of seizure disorder.

                                                Asthma Attack started at 1 pm while seated and attending virtual class. She was under no distress and was not in any way exerting herself. She described the attack as a feeling of someone sitting on her chest and began to hyperventilate. The color drained from her face and her hands felt numb. Her asthma attacks are generally exercise-induced, so this was highly unusual.  She took a dose of albuterol ( 2 puffs with a spacer) and followed her asthma action plan. She laid down and slowed her breathing. 20 minutes later her facial color returned to normal. Two hours later her hands returned to normal. She was disoriented for about 5 hours.

At 1805 patient began to feel hot and nauseous. The patient thought she was going to vomit, so she left her chair in the waiting area to head to the restroom at the back of the store.  at 1807,  Upon rising the patient became weak in the knees and began to collapse.  The patient&#39;s mother initially supported the patient and I was called to assist the patient to the floor. The patient was very pale in appearance as she was assisted gently to the floor, avoiding any injury.  EMS was called shortly after the event around 1810. The patient remained conscious however was a bit disoriented initially while lying on the floor.  The patient recovered quickly, however remained nauseous and complained of feeling hot. Upon questioning the patient, she had not eaten since lunch at school at 1300. The patient was given a cold water and a sprite, of which she had a couple of drinks out of each. The patient was relocated back into a chair at 1815 as she was feeling much better. EMS arrived at 1821. EMS performed a general assessment and a blood pressure check resulting in 130/80. The patient&#39;s mother dismissed any further treatment from EMS.  EMS exited the building at 1827.  The patient and mother waited in the store for a while longer.  Both patient and mother exited on their own, denying escort from associates at 1840.

                                                Patient started feeling a numbness/tingling sensation in her right pinky that slowly moved up her arm and to her elbow about 20 minutes after she received the vaccine. Her right eye started to droop as well and her right pupil was slow to react to light upon assessment by EMT. Patient usually feels dizzy at baseline but felt even more dizzy after the vaccine. The numbness and tingling sensation in the right arm started to subside at 1500 and was completely gone by 1520. Vital signs were taken by EMT, BP 110/70, O2 99%, and P 73 which is patient&#39;s baseline. Patient&#39;s side effects subsided and she was escorted out to the car by her mother and EMT and her mother drove her home. RN and EMT advised patient to call her primary care provider to explain the adverse effects of the vaccine.

                                                Patient stated in evaluation form that she had passed out once before after giving blood for labwork. She and her mother decided to continue with the vaccination as it had never occurred before after getting a vaccine.  A few minutes after the vaccine the patient lost consciousness.  Mom stated that her face tensed up right before hand.  The patient remained in her chair for the duration of the event.  She regained consciousness about 30 to 60 seconds later, and within a few minutes she was conscious but still very shaky, pale, and hot.  She was able to sip some water and we put a cool, wet  paper towel on the back of her neck.  The patient and her mother remained seated and under observation for an additional 15 to 20 minutes with no further issues, at which point they left the store.  I followed up with the patients mother the next day and she said her daughter was exhausted last night, but this morning she woke up feeling well and went to school like normal.

We brought her into the clinic room and sat her down. Never had trouble swallowing and did not have any swelling. Felt hot and bit sweaty and light headed. Reports has felt similar ways in past when had blood drawn. We laid her down and she immediately started feeling better. Mom and sister were with her. Refused ambulance or transfer to physician.

Started out as seconds of slight pain the day after shot until about 9:30pm when the pain became consistent but was a slight pain. I woke up at 2:30am and my chest hurt really badly. It was a constant pain but the amount of pain was back and forth. It hurt more to lay down and if I bent down it was very painful. I stayed up for an hour and a half until the pain went away. When it did I had sweat a lot and was very hot.  I then woke up with little discomfort until an hour after I woke up with slight pain. The pain then has gone off and on but not as painful as it was during the night.

                                                After giving the injection the patient had severe pain at the injection site. A few minutes later she struggled to make a fist with her same hand and reported having pain going up her neck. The injection site did swell up a few minutes after the injection as well and she felt tingling in her hands shortly after. Patient was given 25 mg of benadryl after she reported the tingling in her hands. She did not have any difficulty breathing though. She was able to stand up and walk with her parent to the car and was driven to ER by parent to be checked out.

She was completely unresponsive and given 1 dose of epi and she responded to the epi.  Her dad was with her and said that she has anxiety issues and this is probably the reason she passed out.  EMS was called  and it was decided between EMS and Dad that there was no reason to transport her to the hopital as she was doing fine after being checked out by EMS;  Dad signed a waiver with EMS declining transport to the hospital.

In the meantime, we had call 911 and when they evaluated her, they felt it was somewhat of a panic attack since she did have anxiety before getting the vaccine.

                                                My daughter has been diagnosed with catamenial epilepsy, and typically only had seizures very sporadically (months apart).  However, she recently had a cluster of seizures, which was very atypical for her.  I read a news story last night about the vaccine affecting some women by making their period come back after years of not having it.  In reviewing my daughter&#39;s seizure events, a pattern emerged in relation to her Covid shots:  -Dose 1 of Pfizer on March 17, and the worst seizure she ever had was on March 27 (10 days after first Covid shot) -Dose 2 of Pfizer on March 31, and the second worst seizure she ever had was on April 10 (10 days after second Covid shot)  Prior to the Pfizer Covid shots, the shortest frequency between seizures was one month, and that was prior to her starting epilepsy medication (Keppra).  She was taking her Keppra (morning and night) at 1000 mg twice daily as prescribed, and had not missed any doses when the seizures occurred.  We now suspect that the two recent seizures might be adverse reactions to the Covid shots.

She was taken to medical center where she saw.  She was told she had Syncope due to the stress of the situation of getting the vaccination.  She is resting today and seems to have some fatigue.

                                                I got the shot at around 4 in the afternoon and after sitting in the waiting area for around 15 minutes I was allowed to leave. When I left I only had a slight headache, but nothing that seemed very noticeable. I felt a tad woozy but it was nothing serious so I went on with my day and went to my sports practice for an hour and a half. After I got home and had eaten, I was working and started to feel the effects. It started with an increasingly worse headache at around 9 and as the night went on it got worse and I constantly needed to lie down. My arm had started to feel sore but it was nothing much. I thought I could sleep it off but woke up feeling horrible. My stomach could not hold any food down and my headache had become really bad. I had to go to my sports game but on the car ride over (around 45 min) I got very nauseous. Throughout the course of the day my headache would get worse any time I tried to run and all I wanted to do was lie down and sleep. I was barely able to stand, let alone run and I felt sleepy all day. My arm had also gotten very sore and any contact on it made me flinch back. I was not able to eat or drink anything until about 4  in the afternoon and my stomach was not sitting right the entire time and I constantly was burping and feeling like I was going to vomit despite having only water in my stomach. After I was able to eat the stomach ache went away a bit but the headache lasted through the night and has finally started to subside two days later.

                                                An hour after Pfizer vaccine administration, the parents of the 16 year old patient returned to the pharmacy and reported that their daughter was complaining of trouble breathing in the parking lot.  The immunizing tech asked the parents to bring the patient back to the pharmacy.    The patient returned and while crying and gasping for air, she reported that it felt as if someone was constricting her throat.  She also complained of stiff fingers and feeling numbness/tingling in her upper extremities.    Assuming anaphylactic reaction, one dose of epinephrine was administered.  The patient said she felt slightly better after the first dose but then 2 minutes later, said her breathing was getting worse, and again described feeling her throat tightening.  Five minutes later, a 2nd dose of epinephrine was administered.   The patient was taken to the hospital by paramedics.

Patient&#39;s mother stated patient was experiencing extreme anxiety getting the vaccine and after 20 minutes was wheezing.  She brought patient inside and a Pharmacist came to check on her and her mother stated that she has had a reaction to a medication in the past and just needed Benadryl.  Benadryl was given to her and she took it orally.  Her pulse and blood oxygen were measured with a finger pulse oximeter and were both normal.  Shortly after she was panicking more and had a seizure.  Her mother reported that she has frequent seizures when she has anxiety/panic episodes.  Her seizures were persisting so 911 was called.  Paramedics arrived shortly after and took patient to the hospital.  A few hours later the patient&#39;s mother came back to us to inform us that she was released from the hospital and was feeling fine and back to normal.

She directed us to the table to schedule her second vaccine which was directly in front of us. We went to this table and spoke with two other ladies choosing a date and time and she was also fine talking with them and answering questions of eat time offered and then suddenly she went straight back with warning passed completely out and struck the back of her head on the concrete floor. EMS and RN?s who were there went to her aid immediately and she was unconscious for a little over a minute. They initially couldn?t get her to respond and finally she came to and had no idea what happened and no recollection of falling. She had blurred vision and bleeding a bit from the back of her head and they wanted her to have CT of her head after hitting it that hard. They took her by ambulance to hospital and they assessed her and ordered a CT. The CT thankfully came back clear and she has follow up appointment with concussion doctor first thing in the morning. On discharge she was describing her pain from hitting head a 7/10 It was very scary and everyone around us was visibly upset as well. She has never fainted or had a reaction to any other shot, vaccine or needle before today so that was a very unusual reaction.

This consumer (patients mother) reported for a 16-year-old female patient (daughter).  A 16-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection) via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Apr2021 (at the age of 16-year-old) for SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. She received Pfizer vaccine on 19Apr2021 in left arm and within 2 minutes of receiving it left arm, her right hand started twitching and shaking uncontrollably on an unspecified date. The nurse and the fire department were with her and monitored her for 45 minutes until they suggested her to contact her primary care provider and go to the hospital. In those 45 minutes her right arm started twitching with her hand twitching more. It started going up and down with a flopping motion. Her temperature also started rising but did not reach above 100*F on an unspecified date. She was observed by several doctors in the hospital and was given Adavan (Ativan) for her symptoms which did not subside. She was dismissed from the hospital and was given Adavan (Ativan) again in the hopes that her symptoms would subside in the morning. This morning, only her right hand was still twitching. She is right-handed and could not use her right hand at all as she could not hold a pencil at all, which caused her to be absent from school today. She mentioned that her daughter was healthy, athletic, and had no underlying conditions. Her twin sister also had the vaccine yesterday and experienced nothing but nausea last night with some of the listed side effects. She is asking if there has been reports of this. Waiting to hear from hospital she may need to see a neurologist. Outcome of the event reported as recovering.   Response: Referenced PI Section 6 and Section 18 LAB-1457-7.0 Revised: 06 April 2021  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The skin that is affected is swollen.  Benadryl taken orally did not help decrease the rash, nor did topical Benadryl. She also complains of pain to her left leg from her hip to her knee that intermittently bothers her starting 4/30 and still continues to bother her.   The day after the vaccine was given she had injection site pain, tiredness, extreme headache, fever of 101.8, nausea, chills, body aches.  No swelling or redness to injection site.  No lymph node swelling.

They report that she often has these reactions to shots or medical procedures. This is the same reaction she had to the first shot.

A 16-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 02Apr2021 at 10:15 (batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was reported as a &#34;drive thru COVID-19 vaccine clinic.&#34; The patient&#39;s parents thought it was best for the patient to take the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, since she was eligible to get it so she would be protected. Relevant medical history included acne on the face from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included isotretinoin taken for acne on the face, which she took for almost 3 months from an unspecified start date to 19Apr2021. The patient had no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine, since this was her first dose. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect vaccine. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and had no adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the AEs. On 17Apr2021 at about 16:15 in the afternoon, the patient experienced seizure. It was further reported that the patient had a side effect after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine; the patient had a seizure 15 days after receiving the vaccine. The reporter was asking if seizure had been reported with the vaccine. The reporter had no idea for sure if it was the vaccine, but he wanted to let Pfizer know. The reporter was hoping the patient would be okay and it won&#39;t happen again. The patient would see her physician at the time of the report on 21Apr2021 in a few hours. They would listen to the doctor at the appointment, and they had an appointment with the neurologist to see if she should get the second dose on Friday. They didn&#39;t know yet. The reporter didn&#39;t have the vaccination card with him. The patient had no conditions other than this event. The patient went to the emergency room for the event on an unspecified from which she had blood tests, urine tests, and a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of her brain and they said they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong at that time. They needed to follow up with the hospital in the area to see a neurologist, which they would be doing the following day. They told them to follow up with the neurology department at their Hospital and told them until they find out more information; the patient could do what she needed to do, but she couldn&#39;t drive a car. The reporter asked if Pfizer has had any reports of this and wondered if there had been other reports of seizures. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

The COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech 0.3mL administered IM in right deltoid while patient was sitting. Patient remained sitting for 10 minutes after administered dose. Patient reported feeling well after the injection. Patient stood up while we continued to talk, after 2 more minutes passed out while standing. Suddenly, patient begain to go limp and her eyes crossed and rolled back. Patient fell backwards into the privacy curtain and into aisle 13 of the store. Patient&#39;s head bounced off the floor. Immunizer  knelt next to patient. Patient was unresponsive until immunizer placed cold hand on back of neck and front of chest to check if she was breathing, immunizer calmly  guided patient to breath, slow deep breaths into the belly and patient&#39;s eyes fluttered open. She said her head hurt really bad. Immunizer offered to the accompanying adult to call EMS because patient should be evaluated after hitting her head so hard. The accompanying adult denyed EMS, then stating that patient had previously fainted while walking and said that she would be fine. Immunizer advised patient to remain laying down while immunizer got some ice. Ice was then placed on the back of the head. Patient slowly stood up after laying for 10 minutes and was walked over to a sitting area to put feet up and continue with ice for another 5 minutes before the accomanying adult wanted to leave.

                                                worst seizure; First Pfizer Covid Shot on 17Mar2021# Second Pfizer Covid Shot on 31Mar2021; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer (parent of patient). This report is for the second dose. A 16-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 31Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history includes catamenial epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Patient had no other vaccines in 4 weeks. Patient had no known allergies. Patient had not had COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA) taken at 1000 mg twice daily to help control seizures, start and stop date were not reported and amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 (Lot number EN6206) on the left arm at age 16 years on 17Mar2021 at 10:30AM for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced worst seizures. Reporter&#39;s daughter has been diagnosed with catamenial epilepsy, and has been taking 1000 mg KEPPRA twice daily to help control seizures. The shortest duration between seizures was approximately 1 month, and that was before her epilepsy diagnosis and starting on the KEPPRA. She has recently suffered a cluster of seizures which is atypical for her. Last night, reporter read an article about some women starting their periods after years of not having it soon after receiving the COVID vaccine, so reporter looked back at her daughter&#39;s seizure record and noticed a potential link.Patient had her first Pfizer COVID Shot on 17Mar2021, and she experienced her worst seizure ever on 27Mar2021 (10 days after COVID vaccine). On 31Mar2021, patient had her second Pfizer COVID Shot and she experienced her second worst seizure ever on 10Apr2021 (again 10 days after the second COVID vaccine. Again, her daughter has never had seizures occur in such a short duration, with the minimum time between seizures being one month. The adverse reaction resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient was treated for the event which is increase in KEPPRA dose to 1250 mg. Patient had not been tested with COVID-19 post vaccination. Vaccination facility was at a public health department. The outcome was unknown.   No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient has a seizure history.  Mother stated they have had numerous vaccines in the past without a problem though.  Patient was waiting the period of time afterwards.  Mother then stated she was having a reaction.  Mother stated she is a nurse and said she believed the patient was having a seizure.  Mother later was not sure if patient had fainted also since she was nervous about receiving the shot in the first place.  After paramedics arrived, they took her glucose and was 77.  Paramedics let mom then take patient home to get food.

This was the hand of the arm the vaccine was administered in. Patient said no other symptoms of syncope were present and it was just the left hand with this issue. 10-15 min later she said for  a short time it went up to elbow but did not last there. Had her stay an extra 15 min and by the time the patient left she said it was better.

We picked her up off of the floor and placed her in a chair. She was pale and had some discoloration around her nose area. She was able to speak to us. She felt cold and was sweating at the same time. Her body temp was 97 degrees F. According to her mom, she&#39;s had a previous reaction similar to this but not to this extreme with the HPV shot. We called 911 to have her assessed by the paramedics

                                                Patient started experiencing numbness and tingling on her right side and then all over on Sunday evening 5/2/21. It affected her gait and the numbness and tingling in her legs caused her to have to catch herself and hold on to something to keep from falling. She described that her legs felt weak for a few seconds when walking. This sensation gradually decreased in intensity and duration. When I saw her at 5 pm on 5/3, she had normal gait and only felt the numbness and tingling very briefly. Her exam including her neuro exam was normal on 5/3 when I saw her.  The sensation of numbness and tingling completely resolved by 5/4.  She also experienced HA, nausea and fatigue, but did not have syncope, dizziness or fevers.

A 16-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0167, expiry date: Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left deltoid, on 30Apr2021 15:30, as 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a pharmacy/drug store. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On 30Apr2021 15:30, the patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and was very anxious. She wanted her mom to be present. On the same day, 30Apr2021 15:35, five minutes later, the patient was shaking, and she fainted. The reporter did not know if she was having a convulsion or a seizure. A few minutes later, the patient was sitting and becoming more alert. The patient was given water and one dose of Benadryl. The patient&#39;s vital signs were checked (unknown result). The reporter talked to the patient&#39;s mother and contacted the patient&#39;s pediatrician. The events resulted to emergency room and physician&#39;s office visits. Later in the evening, the reporter followed up with the mother and she confirmed that the patient was doing well and better. The mother asked the reporter if the patient should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of the events fainted, shaking,  &#34;didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure&#34; and &#34;was very anxious&#34; was recovering. The reporter assessed the events fainted, shaking,  &#34;didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure&#34; as serious (medically significant). The reporter considered that BNT162B2 has a causal effect to the adverse events.  Follow-up (18May2021: New information received from a contactable pharmacist includes: reporter information, lab data, suspect drug details (vaccination site and vaccination time), event details (onset time provided, outcome updated to recovering, causality and seriousness assessment provided).  Follow up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, and on a reportedly closed temporal association, the company assessed that a reasonable possibility could not be excluded that the reported events (fainted;  didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure) were related to the suspect product BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I woke up at about 4:30 AM and couldn?t fall back asleep, I kept feeling sleepy until I would get jolted back awake over and over. My joints were hurting, I had somewhat severe nausea, my head started throbbing. At about 6:40 AM my migraine started, my arm felt hot to the touch, and I got dizzy so I took some acetaminophen. At 10:00 PM I noticed the area under my left armpit was a little swollen and really sore, my throat and right tonsil was also sore and it hurt to swallow. The next day (today) I have another migraine, my throat and left armpit are still sore,  and my muscles hurt. I?m getting better though.

About 1 hour after she got her vaccine she developed a tremor in her left hand/forearm. It was most vigorous when she would reach her hand toward her mouth, elbow bent. I would have her straighten her arm and hold if firm to stop it while massaging the muscles in her right forearm and bicep area. She continued to move her arms and massage her left arm, bending and straightening. Her hand would vigorously shake when she reached her hand toward her mouth.  This went on for about one hour and then gradually became less vigorous and then went away completely.

Her body was leaned back on the bench, with head tilted back a bit. When I came out, patient appeared very pale. I immediately ran back into the pharmacy, instructed a fellow employee to reach out for assistance from front end management, and I called 911. While on the phone with 911, I walked out to check on the patient. At that point, she appeared to be coherent and said she was okay, and doesn&#39;t need any medical help. At that time, her brother explained that a reaction like this had occurred in the past when she got other vaccinations/injections so they were familiar with the symptoms. We continued to monitor patient for further reactions. After about 30 minutes, patient appeared to have no further reactions and left.

This lasted about 5 seconds .  She stopped  and then it happened again  for about 5 seconds.  When she came to, she tried to walk away again and had to return to sitting.  Then she vomited twice.  Upon checking her blood pressure after about 30 minutes, it was 97/66.  She sat for a total of about an hour before feeling  good enough to leave.  She was nauseous for the remainder of the day and the next day as well.

I looked, but did not see anything that was concerning. It was just a twitch. On the evening of May 24th, (the patient) went to dinner with her father. On the way to dinner, they were having a regular conversation when (the patient) began to stutter really bad. Her father pulled the car over and looked at her. He noticed her head was shaking uncontrollably and she could not talk. He immediately took her to the emergency room. When I arrived, it looked like she was having a seizure.  (The patient) has never had any kind of speech problem, so she has never stuttered.  the drs told us that they did not have a neurology dept, so we took her to another hospital.

I went to check on her and she appeared pale and seemed very drowsy and unresponsive to questions. She continued to complain about dizziness and nausea. Her parents grabbed some water for her and still there was no improvement. I called 911 to report the symptoms and was advised to administer EpiPen. When asked if her breathing improved, she nodded yes, but she did not appear to have improved. She continued to be unresponsive to questions and appeared extremely drowsy. Within 15 minutes, the ambulance arrived.

Patient&#39;s mother informed in a few minutes that the patient was not feeling well. She stated that the patient felt hot. I grabbed an ice pack on my way out to her. I put the ice pack behind her neck. Patient passed out within a minute of me getting to the patient. She came back to quickly and stated that she was having a hard time seeing and hearing. She then again passes out. At this point I made the decision to call 911. I delegated to my tech to call 911.  She called 911.  I asked my other tech to come help me thinking the patient my have needed to be lower to the ground. The patient again regained consciousness.  At this point I asked tech to call our Store Director and inform them. I also asked that she get me a water for the patient. The patient was feeling better and drank some water. She then again passes out. This time we were struggling to get her to regain consciousness. I used sternal rubs to help the patient regain consciousness. I was having a hard time finding her pulse. This lasted for a minute or two and then she stared responding. Right then EMS arrived and took over. I gave them the information I had and they took her vitals. EMS decided that she was stable and could go home to be monitored by mom. I did call the Mother the next morning to check on the patient.

                                                My daughter had a mild seizure 5 minutes or less after receiving her first vaccine. She fell out of her chair, her eyes fluttered and rolled in the back of her head, her teeth were clocking and chattering and her body was shaking mildly. She lost consciousness for approximately 2 minutes. At 8:33 pm she felt a second seizure begin, her step father grabbed her before she could fall and again, her eyes fluttered and rolled in back of her head, her teeth were clicking and chattering and her whole body was shaking. The second episode lasted approximately 2 minutes as well, with her losing consciousness again. She was taken to the emergency room and stayed overnight for observation.

                                                At about 3pm on 05-01-2021, my daughter started acting crazy. She does have a history of leukemia which was treated 07-03-2020. She has history of neurological problems from chemotherapy. She also has down syndrome. She has headaches since the vaccine. She is non speaking, non-verbal. After her Pfizer vaccine, my daughter repeat things over and over, at night she cries, moves her hands a lot, yells when she is at school. My daughter did not have a fever, body aches after her vaccine. I feed her, bathe her and take care of her and since receiving the Pfizer vaccine she is not the same person. Before the vaccine, my daughter was sociable, respected, educated but since the vaccine she has been out of control and acting crazy.   My daughter received the Pfizer vaccine at a clinic and the doctors there said that she should not get the second dose. At this time, my daughter is scheduled for an MRI appointment on 06-18-2021.

Brother went first and was fine. She was second. After receiving the vaccine (~30-60sec) she appeared to lose conciseness (not sure if complete or partial) she said she didn&#39;t remember all of it, but it was more like a dream. During that she had some twitches/spams (involving circular motions with her arms and leg, leg extended and then retracted, but her head rolled back). Upon coming out/waking she appeared sensitive to light and was nauseous. Left her in the room with her mom to get an ice pack, water, paper towel. Total episode lasted less than a minute, but took about 10-15 minutes (estimate, unsure of full time spent) before she felt good enough to use a wheelchair and get in her mom&#39;s car to drive home.

She couldn?t see and it seemed like it was a Vaso Vagal response which resolved quickly. At 5am the woke up with a fever of 102 and extreme left arm pain. The fever was controlled with Tylenol. Two days after the vaccine she woke up complaining of chest pain and a knot under her left arm. It felt like something was pressing on her chest. We went to the ER and all tests were negative. The feeling lasted until the end of the day. Three days after the shot the next morning she got a headache  for half of the day and resolved with Tylenol. The next day all symptoms were gone.

On May 18th, she had what was considered to be  a pre-syncope event (almost passed out). And she had a pretty large migraine headache as well - the headache lasted for days - for probably three days. 18th, went to dr and they took her vitals. They were under the impression she passed out from having the migraine (her blood pressure is low but normal, in general). Dr was called on Monday 24th - doctor wanted tests. She had another pre-syncope event on May 1st in school and then had  a fever the rest of the week. (From 6/1/2021 - 6/6/2021 - fever and threw up and bad headache - fever until yesterday). I did take her pediatrician. Negative for COVID and Strep on 2nd . She had another migraine on Tuesday. Pediatrician said it could be a viral infection of some sort. Neurologist believes the migraines were exacerbated by the viral infection as well. This one has lingered and it&#39;s the first time she had a migraine within a week or two  weeks of each other. She was out of school was out 2 1/2 days last week and the week of the 18th she was out of school the 19th and got sick again the 20th and was out.

Pulse ox was 99.  There is no labored respirations.  She did not respond to commands but according to his sibling she does not always respond to commands.  However when I took her hand to get her to squeeze my hand and gave it back to her she purposefully put it back on a CD which she was holding to her chest.  Blood pressure was stable heart rate was approximately 130.  The home care aide was not able to tell me whether or not this was her baseline.  Her brother said that she does not does not answer questions depending on the day.  However I am not sure he is the appropriate historian.  She has a history of multiple medical issues including autism, quadriplegia, asthma, and food allergies.  As such she was kept here for a full 30 minutes.  At no time was there any color change.  No labored breathing or wheezing on exam.  There is a little bit of nystagmus and appeared to focus when questioned about how she was doing but without a verbal response.  She will be transferred to the emergency room in stable condition emergency room has been notified.

                                                Patient started to feel strange within 1 minute of receiving the vaccine.  Within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, patient felt very faint, dizzy, nauseous, tingly, lost feeling in lower body, blurry vision, and started shaking.  EMS was called at vaccination site.  EMS arrived about 5 minutes later and took patient&#39;s blood pressure.  First reading was 102/70, second reading a few minutes later was 108/76.  By that time, patient could sit up and was alert and oriented.  Patient never lost consciousness.  Patient was not taken to the ER.   Patient remained on-site for another 45 minutes until symptoms resolved enough that she felt it was safe to leave.  Patient has not had a reaction to vaccines or other medical treatment in the past.

She had already been given an IM Epi Pen injection of epi by the PA prior to my arrival.  I had her lie supine with head down and legs elevated and she felt better.  She declined EMS transport to ER.  Further talk with her dad revealed she had been up since 2 am and had no breakfast.  I don&#39;t think an allergy.

She stated she could &#34;hear the lights&#34;. Her temperature was normal at 96.2 degree Fahrenheit. She stated that these same symptoms have happened before with other vaccines, Within another 20 to 25 minutes she felt better and left with her mother. I checked in 5 hours later via the phone and she was feeling better. She only reported a sore arm at that time.

He is warm and well-perfused although is slightly tachycardic but appears anxious.  His reported inability to move her arms and legs does not seem consistent with a neurologic etiology of this complaint and more likely consistent with anxiety/conversion reaction in the setting of a vasovagal episode.  Will give zyrtec at mother and patient&#39;s request, PO challenge and reassess.

                                                While waiting during the 15 minute monitoring period patient (17 year old female) fainted in her chair. Mom noticed that patient&#39;s arms went rigid right before she passed out. Patient was still breathing and was laid on the ground to her side and 911 was called immediately. Mom was massaging her thighs and arms to increase blood flow and she regained consciousness within a few minutes. She was very pale and felt weak. She was given water and remained laying on the ground for another 10 minutes before EMS arrived. She explained she gets anxiety about any medical procedure, has had history of fainting after shots/blood draw/blood pressure reading. EMS took fingerstick reading and gave her oxygen to ensure she doesn&#39;t faint again from blood glucose fingerstick. Vitals came out to be normal. Mom explained this is very normal and she doesn&#39;t see the need to take her to the hospital. EMS offered to have patient with them in the ambulance for another 15-20 minutes before she&#39;s free to leave.

Mom reports a history of fainting so nurse decided to administer vaccine with client lying down. Vaccine was administered and client immediately stiffened arms and appeared to seize while her eyes rolled back. Nurse reported she turned the client onto her side and she &#34;came to within 20-30 seconds.&#34; She reported blurry vision but could read when asked to do so. She quickly became alert and oriented. Her mother reported that she had a previous episode one time in the past year with painful menses. Her vitals remained stable but each time she attempted to stand up, she reported feeling &#34;sick.&#34; She developed a headache within minutes of the vaccine and took 2 Tylenol while still there. Client left with parent to follow up at hospital.

                                                The rash first started on her hands on 4/2 and was originally attributed to powdered gloves she used during her job at a restaurant. She had her wisdom teeth out on 3/24 and started amoxicillin and steroids for the wisdom teeth on 3/25. She had her first COVID vaccine on 3/30 with arm pain only on 3/31.  She was seen in the urgent care on 4/4 . Rash felt to be due to amoxicillin or contact dermatitis (gloves). She stopped amoxicillin. The rash has continued to evolve. Originally maculopapular and only on hands, nby 4/13  there was both a maculopapular rash in addition to urticarial lesions primarily on her lower extremities, but also present on her trunk and in her groin. It is intensely pruritic. It seems to change over time, though the family is not entirely sure about that. Certainly, they describe confluent erythema and swelling over her right ankle the morning  of 4/13 which was not present by the time she saw me that afternoon. She has had ankle arthralgias as well.    as of 4/16, rash is gone other than feet.

I threw up 5 times and my arms started to get numb. I had a fever when I got home and I couldn?t move because my body hurt so badly. Migraine and dizziness has been persistent ever since and is interfering with my daily life. Been treating with tylenol which helps a little but not completely. As soon as I stand up and move I feel like I?m going to pass out.

This minor client, accompanied by her mother proceeded to the observation room for her 15 minute wait period.  Co-lead RN, was present in the observation room assessing another client.  At 1137 this client&#39;s mother loudly voiced from the back of the room, &#34;she&#39;s feeling dizzy&#34; and co-lead observed client was hanging her head.  Co-lead and EMT1 hurried to her side, and client stated she was feeling lightheaded and dizzy and was suddenly pale and diaphoretic.  EMT1 immediately transferred her from chair to floor with full assistance to prevent a fall/injury.  Client was placed in trendenlenburg position by elevating feet and placing them on the chair.  Client was unresponsive for about 15 seconds until she regained consciousness and returned to baseline mentation.  Client verbalized she &#34;blacked out&#34; and did not remember being placed on the floor.  Client denied pain and respiratory distress. EMT1 called 911 at 1138.  Client and her mother deny she has any medical issues, allergies, medications, or previous incidence of syncope.  At 1145, first set of vitals taken by EMT1 indicate hypotension and bradycardia as follows: BP 68/44, HR 58, and RR 16. At 1145 paramedics arrived and assumed care after receiving report from EMT2.  At 1150 medics took VS with BP 70/50, HR 54, and blood glucose 95, and determined they would start an IV to administer a 500cc bolus for dehydration and to improve BP. Client was also placed on 2L O2 for comfort, no desat noted. At 1200, medics advised client&#39;s mother and co-lead they would transport client to the Hospital for further evaluation.  Medics departed at 1205 to transport client to the hospital.

                                                about 5 minutes after administration, patient became unresponsive and was going in and out of consciousness. Her pupils became dilated and she would not respond to stimuli. Her respiratory status was unclear. No hives or rash could be observed. Patient became pale in the face. An allergic reaction could not be ruled out and the patient became less responsive so an EpiPen 0.3mg was administered in the left thigh. Patient was placed on her back on the ground. She became more alert and seemed to have normal breathing. EMS arrived and took vitals. Blood pressure was 138/77 with a heart rate of 88 bpm. Patient&#39;s father is taking her to her PCP for follow up this afternoon.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

                                                Recipient is a 17yo who presented for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. She reported some anxiety related to receiving dose #2, and had some nausea after dose #1. She was alone as a driver of her own POV.  Consent was obtained from the recipient and her custodial grandparent by phone, witnessed by doctor. She initially did well after the vaccine, but after approximately 5 minutes began to complain of feeling nauseated, lightheaded, and tingling extremities (hands and feet). She was noted to be hyperventilating, and was placed in a supine position but continued to feel some lightheadedness and difficulty breathing. Breath sounds were clear without wheezing noted, HR 70s with RRR. She was noted to have ongoing anxiety, nausea and symptoms progressed and although she remained normotensive to hypertensive (initial BP 128/74), she had repeated episodes of syncope.  She was transferred to the ambulance and further vitals and EKG were obtained. She had some confusion after episodes of syncope and some seizure-like activity with syncope, with very brief episodes of LOC, with noted tachycardia with HR up to the 140s during episodes of syncope.  BP ranged 129/86 to 140/84. IV access obtained and she was given NS and started on oxygen at 2 liters, but saturations remained in the 98-99% range. She was ultimately transferred to the local ER for further evaluation and management given ongoing symptoms, evaluated at hospital.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the shot, my daughter felt hotness running down the length of her vaccinated arm and into her hand. Started feeling hot and started to produce a small patch of hives on the outside of the throat and chest. Did vigorous windmill motions with vaccinated arm.  She had a feeling of slight unwellness that was followed by a rush of energy.  As we leave the store and start to drive home her hives are a little bit worse and she says she feels a little lightheaded and has some heart palpations. But is still reporting a rush of energy. By the time we get home 10 minutes later hives,  lightheadedness, and heart palpations have resolved.  She feels great the rest of the day. Next day slight redness around the injection site and arm a bit sore. The following day redness is gone but a slight rash is starting to show up around the neck. 5 days later, the rash becomes inflamed, sore, hot and itchy, hives are full upper-body flareups. She takes Allegra 24 for hives control. Rash comes and goes daily.  Acts more like hives. Allegra 24 controls hives mostly along with icing. After a few days, the effectiveness of the Allegra 24 is not as efficient with the neck rash. Switches to Zyrtec 24 which seems to provide better relief from both hives and rash around the neck. Sees Dr. April 29th. He advises not to take a second dose of Pfizer at this time and prescribes her an EpiPen.

It then included both sides of her face; patient could not open her eye or control her face; her left leg had goosebumps and chills; her left leg had goosebumps and chills; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 17-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8731) via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 at 15:15 (at the age of 17-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event was reported as none. Concomitant mediations included ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (JOLESSA) taken &#34;to decrease her periods&#34; from 2019 (&#34;about two years ago&#34;) and ongoing and at an unspecified dose, cyclic, for three months straight with no placebo. Then takes a placebo pill for one week straight and biotin taken &#34;for hair and nail growth&#34; from an unspecified date (&#34;she began taking within the last 6 months&#34;) and ongoing. There was no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine, there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. It was not provided whether there were adverse events following prior vaccinations. On 07Apr2021 the patient experienced began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache. The reporter called to report that her daughter had a severe reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in her left arm. Less than an hour after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed goosebumps and chills in her left leg. The reporter was not very concerned about it at the time. About 9:00PM that same night, the patient started complaining of pinching in her left shoulder. The reporter was not too terribly concerned. By 9:30PM, that same night, the patient started to have left eye twitches. Then they increased to eye spasms, then the patient could not open her eye or control her face. Then, it progressed to patients nose and left side of her face. At that point, the reporter tried to contact a nurse with the health insurance advice line. She waited for 30 minutes. The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to get worse, so the reporter took the patient to the emergency room. While the patient was in the emergency room triage, while hospital staff were getting her blood pressure and temperature, her symptoms also started to involve the right side of her face. Around 10:15PM, that same night, the patient started to get nauseous and a headache kicked in. The emergency department took patient straight back to a room. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The emergency department started an IV on the patient, and they administered Reglan, Benadryl, and Toradol to treat her symptoms. The emergency department ran blood tests, preformed a urinalysis and a CT scan. The reporter did not know what all blood testing that was done revealed; however, the reporter did know that they told her that none of the testing revealed anything and were all normal. The patient was eventually discharged from the emergency department at about 1:50AM. She was sent home with Butalbital, for headache and was advised to take ibuprofen. She was still having the twitching but not as bad when discharged. On 08Apr2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had not completely subsided, but were significantly better. On 08Apr2021, the patient woke up with nausea, chills and a headache. The reporter expected the patient to have these side effects. The side effects continued until very late in the day on 10Apr2021. The patient never vomited, was only very nauseous. The reporter also stated that when the woman was administering the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the woman said &#34;oops&#34; and it was not explained what &#34;oops&#34; meant. The reporter asked if it was possible that the patient received the dose subcutaneously and that was why she had these side effects. The reporter also stated that the second dose was scheduled for 28Apr2021 and she asked if the patient should receive the second dose. The clinical outcomes of the events began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache all recovered/resolved on 10Apr2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed; No further information is expected.

                                                After a few minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported dizziness, light headedness, and blurry/dots in vision. She then became more upset leading to hyperventilation and crying. She then said she had tingling in her fingers, which progressed to difficulty moving her fingers/stiff fingers, and coldness and redness in tips of fingers. She then reported she was loosing sensations in her feet and legs. 911 was called. We tried to have the patient take slow deep breaths. We offered an ice pack and water up front and a heat pack for her fingers. Paramedics arrived. Her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, glucose were within normal limits. She was given oxygen and the paramedic was able to help her slow her breathing. Her fingers went back to normal and she felt fine before leaving. She did not feel the need to go with the paramedics.

My arm stayed sore and hard to use all day and at night about 7:30 - 8:00 a sharp pain started lancing through my thigh to my knee, after a half hour or so it moved to include down to my ankle, then spaced out between the three randomly till about nine wen it moved to my side for about twenty minutes or so before becoming a dull throb in my leg till I fell asleep.  The next day I felt a slight ickyness that last off and on all day as well as a light headache that got worse in the evening. The soreness in my arm dulled down and was just about gone by night, as well as rolling nausea all day though light. Today I woke up a little icky, very tired, and with a headache that has lasted all day and worened during the night, the soreness in my arm is gone.

RN asked if she was okay, stated she was scared and that her arms felt weird and her chest was tight.  RN asked some questions about her health history, she then offered a granola bar and water. Client drank some water, declined snack. Clients hand began to shake, RN offered to lay client on a cot but client declined. Her dad came to check on her, she broke down saying that her arms were numb and chest was tight. The 15 vaccine minute timer went off, client stood but legs were week. She sat down and then slid herself onto the floor. She at first went into a fetal position then laid out flat on the floor. Client began acting more panicked and frantic with short quick breaths and her hands appeared to be contracting some. Clinic team made the decision to call 911 and administer 0.50 mg epinephrine. Ambulance arrived quickly and client was taken to the Medical Center via ambulance.

                                                Patient was waiting in the waiting area for 6 minutes after getting the pfizer covid vaccine when she started to feel like she was going to faint. Her mom was with her. Her mom had already given her a snack when I was notified. Pt stated her vision was blurry and her hearing was &#34;like she was in a tunnel&#34;. She was feeling cold and was feeling scared of that feeling. I asked if I could apply a cold pack and asked her to rest the back of her head against the wall and to close her eyes. I applied the cold pack to her forehead and observed her. She started to sweat and was calmer. She was feeling better and her hearing and vision was back to normal. I had her wait for a total of 30 minutes and had my technician stay with her at that time. She was feeling better and I asked her mom to hang on to her while walking to their car. I followed up with the patient 4 hours later and she was doing well. She said she was feeling well and her arm was not even sore just some fatigue.

Patient began screaming in pain.  Her hands became rigid and paralyzed. She was completely unable to move both hands. Patient was able to feel if someone was touching her hands.  Her face began tingling and feeling numb. Patient was lying down and almost passed our. I asked CVS to call 911 and if they should administer an epi pen.  The epi pen was not administered.  I (mother) went w/ child in the ambulance to  Hospital. EMT monitored her vitals, which were normal. Patient was still unable to move her hands until after she was admitted to Hospital. Patient did not receive any IV r medication at Hospital. The sensation in her hands slowly came back with the numbness subsiding  after about 1.5 hours in the ER.

                                                Less than 1 minute after received the shot, patient became clammy and pale while sitting in chair. Her eyes rolled back in her head and her body went slack. Myself (parent) and the nurse who had given the shot braced her on either side while she appeared to fade in and out of consciousness for several minutes (she seemed to occasionally interact with us, mumbling responses to &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; questions). The nurse did not want to lower her to the floor, but wanted to keep her propped on the chair. Her head kept rolling to the side. At one point, she began to jerk rhythmically.  Just as I was about to bring this to the attention of the nurse, the patient returned to consciousness. Patient was moved to a rolling recliner chair and taken to a recovery area where I (parent) did not see her for another 30 minutes as I was receiving my own shot. The chair she had sat in was wet, but it was assumed this was due to sweat (patient had sweated profusely).  On the way out of the clinic, noticing a wet stain on the back side of patient&#39;s pants, I asked if she had wet her pants (quietly) two separate times. Patient denied it both times. However, upon returning home, patient confirmed that she had wet her pants.  Patient was monitored during the evening for similar adverse events ; none noted.  Patient ate lunch approximately 1 hour before receiving shot and was given crackers while at clinic. Patient is a well-hydrated individual, and also drank water while on-site. No fever either before or after shot. A slightly elevated BP the next day (135/83). However, patient complained of headache, fatigue, and pain at injection location; elevated BP may be related to headache and/or ordeal from day of the shot.

                                                Patient upon seated for the 15 minutes post-vaccination fainted. When she was coming through, she started shaking as if she was having a seizure. When I reached the patient, she was shaking and then came through and stopped shaking. Patient was still pale, sweating, and didn&#39;t feel okay. 911 was already called once the patient was shaking. As I am checking in on the patient, the mom discloses that she has fainted at least twice before and when she comes through she shakes but it is not seizures. However, during the screening process, patient and mom stated the patient never had any problems when getting vaccinated. I got her BP checked and it was 102/61 and HR of 92. We had the patient sit still and drink water. When EMS arrived within 5-10 mins, they took her vitals and it was 112/70s and HR of 84 with 98% O2 sat. Patient and mom decided to be taken to the ED to make sure she is okay.

She was breathing but she was out. I called the ambulance. And they took her in to ER. What they put in the paperwork was that she had a seizure and they wrote that she had  had syncope episode - it took 20 minutes to come out of it. Which she has never had anything like that.

She felt nauseous and dizzy. I laid her on floor with her feet elevated on a chair with her head to the side so she would not aspirate if she vomitted.. She felt better after a while and wanted to sit. When she was sitting in the armchair she vomitted and said she felt worse, so I then called 911.   They evaluated her and her blood pressure was very low and they gave her iv fluids and took her to the emergency room

                                                Patient was very anxious and breathing heavy. About 5 minutes after the vaccination they started to hyperventilate and ended up throwing up. After letting them sit and relax for 5 minutes, the patient then had to throw up again and told their mother they felt like they were going to faint. Mother and myself stood by, while patient did end up fainting. We slowly lowered them to the ground, and on the way down their body got stiff and patient had uncontrollable movements and was hardly responsive. Mother and myself finally got her safely to the floor as they came to and was responding to verbal ques and stimulation from mother. Mother went to get water and i stayed with the patient to ensure no other things happen. Patient ended up doing alright after relaxing for a few and then i walked them and mother to their car and ensured they were feeling good enough to go home. I then advised the mother to seek medical attention.

A 17-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 20May2021 (age at the time of vaccination 17-year-old) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergic to sulfa drugs. Historical vaccine includes first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that after receiving the shot patient experienced after receiving the shot she experienced the &#34;covids bullseye&#34;, a circle on her arm at the site of administration, tired, her arm was a little sore. On Saturday, the patient got a rash of the diameter of a lemon on her inner thigh, so the reporter told her to only use sunblock, next day (Sunday) both legs were covered in a rash. Reporter looked on the Pfizer&#39;s website and saw that rash was reported in 0.001 percent of people who had the vaccine. Also, on Sunday, reporter took the patient to the doctor but he was not there, so she called a service (reporter did not elaborate on this) and a person told them that the rash could be from a serious disease called &#34;petechiae rash&#34; and told them to take patient to ER where she got the shot. Once in the ER, they told them that it was not the serious condition &#34;petechiae rash&#34; but that it was a &#34;rash&#34; and that they had never heard before of anybody experiencing a &#34;rash&#34; after the administration of the vaccine. Reporter wanted to know if &#34;rash&#34; has been reported as an adverse event of the Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine, how long after the administration of the vaccine appears and how long it lasts. She would also like to know if we can call the facility to let them know that &#34;rash&#34; was reported as a side effect of the vaccine, since she was upset because she does not understand how someone in the ER does not know that &#34;rash&#34; was an adverse reaction and they had them thinking for a couple of hours that patient could be suffering of a serious disease. Reporter does not want someone else to go through this situation. Reporter mentioned that in the ER told them to wait 2 days and give Benadryl to patient, so she wanted to confirm if this was the right treatment for patient and if she should wait those 2 days to see if the rash was gone before she calls the doctor. Reporter wanted to know how long after the administration of the vaccine the rash appears and how long the rash would last. The outcome of the event was unknown   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient told us that she has passed out and vomited after receiving vaccines in the past. After getting the vaccine, she didn&#39;t feel well. We monitored her in the vaccine room for about 5 minutes. She had a drink of water, then when she was ready, her family helped her into the lobby I returned to the pharmacy, and continued to watch her. The patient&#39;s mom came to the window and said patient had fainted. I went to her, and said we need to lower her to the floor. At that point, mom said patient was not breathing I quickly lowered her to the floor, while dad supported her head. I didn&#39;t have time to verify that she wasn&#39;t breathing, because as soon as she touched the floor, she began convulsing, then sat up and w was immediately awake. She sat up, and we explained that she had passed out and I had her lie down. I stayed with her for a few minutes, asking if they wanted an ambulance (which mom and dad declined) while making sure she was ok. She was just resting at this point, so I returned to the pharmacy, and ask them to let me know if anything changed I continued to watch her from the pharmacy window, and the patient said she was nauseated. We gave mom a bag, and patient vomited in the bag. After a couple more minutes, she seemed to be recovering, and mom and dad helped her out of the store. I followed up with mom at 4:15pm, and mom said patient was still nauseated and had vomited a couple more times. I followed up one last time at 4:45pm, and patient was feeling a bit better, but mom was going to keep an eye on her I recommended that mom take her to a doctor to be evaluated, but mom said she would just keep an eye on her through the night. I told mom that I would follow up again in the morning.

The patient had her second Pfizer shot on Thursday 20May2021 at 4:30, the only side effect she seem to have, was her arm hurt and she was tired and the reporter don&#39;t know, her aunt was a pharmacist and said that circle that she developed at the site of the shot, and called it as a Covid bullseye. On Saturday 22May2021, the patient had rash about the size of a diameter of  a lemon on the inside of her leg, the reporter didn&#39;t think anything out she has been out in the sun so they just observed until Sunday, 23May2021 she got the rash all over both of her leg. Previously she was has an allergic reaction of Sulphur drugs so with this rash all over both of her legs what they did was they called her doctors office Sunday and they haven&#39;t answering. They have a service that you can call about medical things, person that answers, there was a woman and said she know nothing about a rash they thought it would may be side effect from Pfizer because the reporter looked on the website and in the website rash was listed, usually rare. The patient does not have anaphylactic shock any of that there was a rash they think it was 0.001 they tried to explain this to the woman and she insisted it was something called Petechiae rash, which is a serious rash. She insisted not take the patient to the urgent care, she said they should take her to the ER and not urgent care, they took her to the ER they said they didn&#39;t know, it was definitely not the Petechiae rash which was a released that&#39;s a serious problem. They said it was okay to just give her Benadryl which they could have decided to give at home, but they didn&#39;t know if Benadryl was okay to take if the patient took the COVID vaccine. They were advised to bring her back to the doctor in 2 days if it doesn&#39;t go away. ER said they had never seen anyone who had a rash, they don&#39;t know any rash. The reporter tried to tell  that it&#39;s on the website it&#39;s on a Pfizer website and thought she was thinking she should alert them about this because this was a lot of lot of gut ranching and anxiety that if this person calling from the doctor saying that the rash was a Petechiae rash which was a serious blood disease. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not take other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took Excedrin and experienced allergies. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 09:45 AM (Lot Number: EL9269) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. On 24Feb2021 at around 7:00pm she started getting a migraine at the base of her head. She then was lethargic, and became extremely nauseous. She started getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes (inability to control temperature regulation). Her heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down. Her ribs and lungs hurt. And her stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains. At one point it felt as if she could feel every cell in her body if that makes sense. Not the worst pain she had experienced but definitely not pleasant. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being run over by a car and 1 being a paper cut) she would say it was a 5-6. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Facility type vaccine was facility. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and did not have COVID test post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                I was already dealing with C Diff and still am, but it caused me to become extremely motion sick in the car ride home and I had to keep pulling over to vomit. As soon as I got home my injection arm started to hurt really bad and now the morning after I can&#39;t move my arm due to the pain.

I verified with patient if she can breathe, and she stated she could only breathe through her nose, and her throat is tight and closing. I went out of the pharmacy and administered the EpiPen dose on outer left thigh as the other pharmacist was calling 911. The mother arrived at the pharmacy and stated to us she is an ER nurse and told us to cancel the 911 response as she would take the patient to ER immediately. Patient was given the vaccination card and mother took patient away to go to ER, as patient could still walk. The patient appeared stable.

She also experienced shooting pains and tingling in the same arm she received the vaccination. At work, it hurts when she carries things and has dropped items, which is unusual. Pain is mainly in the shoulder, but sometimes in the forearm. She has tried Tylenol, ice and naproxen with no relief. She received methylprednisolone on 4/12, and now feels that she is having an allergic reaction.  Complaints of increased wheezing, shortness of breath and swelling of her skin, she has used her albuterol inhaler at home which has provided no relief.   On 4/13 she received albuterol by nebulizer and an IV dose of methylprednisolone at the emergency department. She is going to start albuterol nebulizer at home, continue OTC antihistamine, discontinue the methyprednisolone and start prednisone tomorrow.

                                                There was a miscommunication between the pharmacist and the nurse and the shot did not get reconstituted so patient was injected with 0.3mL of the concentrated stock solution which probably ended up being about 4-5 doses worth. She complained of a sore arm the next day and said it was moderate pain (4/10). This was the only adverse event that was reported by the patient we followed up with her on 4/14/21 and she said she had fully recovered.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after vaccine administered, patient started feeling nauseous and dizzy. She was also pale and clammy.  Offered patient water and allowed to remove face mask. Instructed on breathing slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth. This helped briefly but then patient verbalized that she was feeling more light headed and thought she should lie down on exam table. Remained at patient&#39;s side but did not allow her to stand up in order to relocate from chair to exam table. Approximately 7 minutes after vaccine administration, patient briefly lost consciousness for less than 30 seconds and had slight jerking movements during this time. Remained at patient&#39;s side and prevented her from falling out of chair, hitting head, or other injury during syncopal event. After patient regained consciousness, she began sipping on water. A cold, wet paper towel was placed to the back of her neck. Continued to observe patient in exam room for another 5 minutes then she was escorted to waiting area by provider. Waiting area was just outside exam room and patient remained in the presence of a patient care technician, as well as her mother. Patient remained in waiting area for a total observation time of 30 minutes. No other adverse events occurred. Patient and mother both reported that patient does not do well after vaccines and has had similar symptoms after other vaccines in the past.

The leg symptom were present when seen 5 days ago, though were not discussed as Patient wasnt sure if thats what was really starting.

Also notes that different extremities feel different - left is worse than right.

At that visit was referred to ER, where workup for repeat clot was normal (CTA, b/l upper extremities dopplers, head/neck CT, CXR).  EKG was notable for Sinus tach and nonspecific T wave abnormalities.  Discharged home with close follow up. Since then the intensity of the symptom as worsened and the leg symptoms have gotten more pronounced and consistent with the upper extremities symptom.

Mom at pts side and sts pt first passed out at the age of 4 years old when she witnessed her father having blood drawn for a health screen.   She also reportedly passed out after receiving a vaccine at Pharmacy in 2017.  Due to her history of injection related syncopal episodes, pt is placed in a supine position on the cot as precaution. Approximately 30 seconds after receiving the injection, the pt was witnessed becoming unresponsive by this HCP.  Pt was then witnessed having her eyes roll up and back followed by a  few seconds of generalized seizure activity.  HCP remains at pts side.  The cot has a suspended cloth and is soft, therefore, pt is safe from harm on it.   Seizure ends after seconds and pt awakens.  She is initially confused but orients quickly.  She remains AOX4 and has no complaints.  Spoke with mom extensively about pts condition and presenting symptoms.  VS- HR initially 52 but quickly improves to 77, BP 107/64, RR 16, sats 98%.  Pt will follow up with  pts pediatrician.  Mother and pt do not want pt evaluated at the ER today and do not want an ambulance.  VAERS info given.

                                                Approximately two minutes after vaccine injection, pt started to feel dizzy, saw spots, felt like she was going to pass out. Someone got a wheelchair and we took her back to observation/treatment area. Patient was very drowsy, felt nauseous, hands were tingling, and was cold and clammy.  We asked her to text her Mom, who was sitting out in the parking lot, to have her come inside.  Pt reported passing out with HPV vaccine and on blood draws.  We moved patient to pt bed and took vitals (listed below).  Patient was able to recover without any medication administration under close observation.  After about 20 mins in obs/treatment area, she was feeling better and we moved her to the observation room with her Mom.  We had leftover vaccine syringes, so Mom received her first dose of vaccine.  They waited together until Mom&#39;s 15 mn obs time was over.  Patient and someone left the clinic feeling fine and under their own power around 1845.

I went to my doctor and they suspected I could have appendicitis and also symptoms from the vaccine. They suggested going to the ER after 3 days if systems persisted. I went home after the doctor visit and was nauseous. I had sprite, ate white rice and chicken broth. My abdomen felt a bit better but I had a bad headache. 5/8/21 - Saturday I awoke at 6am with stabbing/burning chest pain that increased as time progressed. The chest pain was increasing and getting worse after 1 hour and 30 minutes. The pain was in the middle of my chest. My mom took me to the Emergency Room.

A 18-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9264), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 06Feb2021 12:45 (at the time of 18-years-old) as second dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included partial aortic bicuspid valve, aortic dialation, sulfa wellbutrin allergies (known allergies) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. No other vaccine administered in four weeks. The patient had not covid prior vaccination. The patient had not tested positive for covid post vaccination. Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE) for an unspecified indication, from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Lot no EL8982,Administration time=12:15 PM,Vaccine location Left arm, Dose no 1) on 16Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. She received the vaccine at 12:50 PM and my temperature was 98.6 with no symptoms. At 1 am, her temperature went up to 99.6° and a headache, muscle aches and slight chills started. At 4:20 AM, woke up with a 101.6 fever, extreme nausea, dehydration and shakiness. In the morning at 9:00 AM temperature was 100.3 and when I got up around 12:00 PM, was extremely fatigued, dizzy when standing, and slightly nauseous which made it hard to eat normal foods. At 1:20 PM, temperature was 100.7. At 7:00 PM, nausea subsided slightly and was able to eat normal foods. At 10:00 PM, cold chills began in and at 11:00 PM, temperature was 100.4. The next day (08Feb2021), my temperature was at 97.8 upon awakening and felt dizzy, tired and winded with regular activities throughout the days but no fever. By the next day (09Feb), patient was completely syptom free. Arm pain was very minimal, pain level 1, on the day of vaccination and the day after and gone after that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101.6 (at 4:20 patient temperature was 101.6), 100.3 (at 9 temperature of patient was 100.3), 100.7 (at 13:20 patient temperature was 100.7), 100.4 (at 23:00 patient temperature was 100.4), 99.6 (at 13:00 patient temperature was 99.6F) on 07Feb2021, and 97.8 (patient temperature was 97.8) on 08Feb2021.

                                                seizure; This is a Spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). An 18-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Bipolar disorder, Depression, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medication included cariprazine hydrochloride (VRAYLAR) orally from 18Mar2021 to 02Apr2021 at 1.5 mg, daily for Bipolar disorder; escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) at 10 mg for Depression; amfetamine sulfate (EVEKEO) 2 times a day for ADHD; bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN) and mirtazapine (REMERON) for sleep (disorder). It was reported patient experienced seizure on 02Apr2021 after using concomitantly Vraylar, Lexapro, Evekeo, Wellbutrin and Remeron, experienced seizure after using concomitantly Lexapro and Wellbutrin. The initial report from the United States was received via Company representative originating from a nurse on 15Apr2021, regarding an 18-year-old female patient who experienced seizure, drug interaction, and labelled drug-drug interacton medication error following the administration of cariprazine hydrochloride, amfetamine sulfate, escitalopram oxalate, mirtazapine, Pfizer Covid-19 and bupropion hydrochloride. Company received the report on 16Apr2021. Reportedly, the patient began cariprazine hydrochloride 1.5mg daily orally for Bipolar disorder on 18Mar2021, had the Covid-19 vaccine on 01Apr2021, and had a seizure on 02Apr2021. The patient had no history of seizures. The reporter did not believe the seizure was caused by the cariprazine hydrochloride (causality for seizure was also reported as unlikely). The patient was taken to the emergency room but not admitted, treatment and outcome unknown other than the emergency room staff advised the patient to &#34;discontinue everything&#34;. The reporter assessed the relationship between cariprazine hydrochloride and the event of seizure as unlikely. Laboratory tests were not reported. The patient experienced the seizure one day after Covid 19 vaccine. Considering the short onset  latency, the vaccine was also considered co-suspect. The case in confounded by patient&#39;s use of co-suspect medications that could have lowered the seizure threshold. The following important missing medical information will be helpful for further case evaluation: medical history, indications and therapy dates for all suspects, action taken, lab results (drug blood levels), investigations, treatment, outcome. Treatment information was not provided. At the time of the report, the outcome of seizure was reported as unknown. This case was considered serious due to the following seriousness criterion: medically significant.  Information on batch number has been request.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. Contributory role of concomitant medications should also be considered. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                within 34 hours of the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid shot, patient began to break out in welts/hives behind her knees. She woke up in the middle of the night with her scalp itching and her ears hot as well as the welts behind her knees. Given Benadryl which helped a little for about 2 hours but then the hives just kept spreading and growing into huge swollen itchy patches on her body. By Friday afternoon, she had tried Benadryl and calamine lotion only to have it continue to get worse. We ended up with the Urgent care by 4pm Friday, 4-30-21. They gave her Prevacid and prescribed steroid cream. They told us if it got worse or affected breathing to go ER. We went home and kept taking the benedryl every 6 Hours and using the steroid cream. as one welt would begin to disappear, others would pop up. the steroid cream did not help in that regard. the benedrul would give about 50% relief for about 2 hours before the itching got very bad. Unable to sleep to do anything, we took patient to the pediatrician that Sat morning 5-1-21. She examined her and told her to take Claritin in the morning and Zyrtec at night to help. She was hestiant to prescribe any steroids due to unknown interaction or affects with the Covid shot. She told us to keep checking in with her and also if it got worse or spread to her face/mouth or any trouble breathing to go to the ER. We went home and tried to take an oatmeal bath. It only made things worse. By 10pm that Sat night 5-1-21, the hives had spread to patient&#39;s face and lips and were affecting her throat. Her voice got very raspy. we decided at that point to take her to the ER. They started her on steroids that night. She continued taking the steroids for 5 days after that. The steroids did help make her hives go away. However, within 2 days of finishing the steroids, patient noticed that she still did not feel 100%. That Saturday 5-8-21, She began to feel light-headed and off. She also began to feel fatigued. She came home from an errand needing to lay down and feeling dizzy. A few days after that, she began to have gas and indigestion, feeling like something caught in her throat and feeling nauseous. She also noticed that there a few nights in all of this that she would wake up shivering for no reason. The shivering would continue until she woke up in the morning. This report is being filed on 5-30-21. Since her 2nd shot and after the hives, we have been dealing with ongoing dizziness, fatigue, tiredness, lightheadedness and nausea to varying degrees. She has not been able to resume regular activates of being active or working out. WE have been back to the dr.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; formulation solution for injection; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date as 2ND DOSE,SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s Disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on 31Mar2021 for covid-19 immunization and experienced severe indigestion, vomiting and did not feel well. On an unspecified date (36 hours after receiving the second dose of vaccine), the patient broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching, her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The patient was prescribed steroid creams, and she self-administered three antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl. The hives went away. After that on an unspecified date, the patient had gastrointestinal (GI) issues, she had very gassy feeling of something stuck in the throat, and had nausea to the point of being unable to eat. Also, she shivered and shakes out of the blue, felt lightheaded and dizzy with extreme fatigue. The patient received treatment with steroid creams, and antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl for the events 36h after &#34;broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching and her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The caller (reporter) mentioned that she heard that the vaccine causes problems in fertility hence caller asked for information on fertility studies with regards to the vaccine in response she was explained reports on the possible side effects, mentioned no information found for non-reported AEs, and referred to health care professional (HCP) for further guidance. Further, caller asked for information on how to treat or go about with the side in response she was informed that Pfizer was unable to make treatment recommendations specific for individual patients and referred to HCP for further guidance. Again, Caller asked, &#34;how the vaccines work&#34; in response she was explained about vaccine mechanism and CDC information. Caller asked if there was a way to measure the spiked proteins in the body as caller wanted to know how to measure/assess immunity after vaccination in response she was being explained about CDC recommendation, and referred to HCP for further guidance. Moreover, caller asked if there were other proteins in the body/organs/cells that were similar to the spike protein that our body could possibly react to in response mentioned that no information found on body components similar to the SARS-CoV2 Spike Protein, and she was referred to HCP for discussion. Caller complained and mentioned &#34;reporter don&#39;t think all this information is being made public, it just seems to me like the issues for the vaccine is much worse for her than as if she got COVID19. Reporter really hope that the Doctors/ CDC / Pfizer and all organizations would reconsider this, especially on the possibility on the issue on the body attacking its own self.&#34; The outcome of the event hives was considered as resolved while the outcome of all other reported events was unknown at the time of this report.  Information on Batch/Lot number has been requested.

An 18-years-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8736, expiration date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation (Age at Vaccination: 18years).  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) 10mg/day (as medications in two weeks) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. No known allergies and no other vaccine in four weeks. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 15May2021, the patient felt dizzy, had cold sweating, was scared, and thought she was having a panic attack but felt more sick than usual. On 15May2021, the patient stood up from couch, walked 15 - 20 steps and then fell straight over on her face, hitting her chin and splitting it open; she was conscious when rolled over by her parents but had significant memory loss (knew her name but not her school grade or which classes she was taking). She was taken to the hospital, computerized tomogram (CT) Scan, electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal, and no evidence of seizure were there. On 15May2021, the patient was diagnosed with mild con-cussion and got stitches on the chin as therapeutic measure for her chin splitting. Doctor suggested dehydration may had been a factor, also insufficient food intake (had not eaten yet) (start date: 15May2021). The patient stayed home from school for a week with memory improving each day and still did not remember completely a period of 48 hours starting around time of vaccination however, other symptoms had resolved. The patient had never fainted before. The treatment for rest of events was unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan and EKG both as normal, both on 15May2021. The outcome for mild con-cussion and significant memory loss was recovering; and rest all events were resolved.

But later that night I couldn?t go to sleep and began to shake all over my body. I did not have shortness of breath, or heart pains- I just couldn?t stop shaking. I tried to control my breathing to help but it did nothing.  After the shaking stopped I tried to sleep again but I threw up twice and could not fall back asleep.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

I woke up around 8:20am and felt that I had a subjective fever.  I was also experiencing intense body ache and headache.  I took my temperature and it showed to be 100.6ºF.  I was still experiencing chills despite also feeling hot at the same time.  After an hour, my temperature was 101ºF.  I took 2 naproxen sodium tablets (440mg) to relieve fever.  Around 10:45am, my fever reduced but my body ache and headache stayed at the same pain level.  Around 2pm, I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen (400mg).  My headache stopped around 8:00pm.  My body aches stopped the morning of 01/15/2021.

Later in the day around 3:00pm I got chills and muscle soreness throughout my whole body. I then started to develop pain in my chest while breathing and I was having to gasp for air(this was around 5:30pm). My skin (mostly on my back) felt like it was burning and itchy. That lasted the entire night.  24 hours after the injection and I am still feeling tightness in my chest when I breathe, sore throat, and sore muscles.

Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

                                                Around 7-7:30 PM, I started to feel weird tingly feelings run up and down all of my limbs at the same time but it was over in about 2 minutes. Then I couldn?t stop my eyes from continuously rolling back into my head. That happened for about 4 minutes or so sometimes it would happen like 3 or 4 times in a row and sometimes it would be every 20 seconds or so. I was extremely confused and forgetful for the next 40 minutes and then I slowly began to be able to recall stuff.

One of the nurses at the site, gave me several doses of Benadryl and a Zyrtec. I was there 45 minutes - I kept getting more and more hives and my throat was getting itchy and my breathing was off a little bit. After taking the Benadryl, it started slowing down eventually and I was able to leave in 45 to fifty minutes. My primary care physician told me to take Benadryl before and after getting the second round of the vaccine. I had hives and a small rash on my chest for three days and I had to take Benadryl for those days. I t was extremely itchy. Symptoms resolved by end of day three.  There was also a slight tingling in my fingers  while I was experiencing the rash.

                                                S:  Patient began to develop petechiae within about 10 minutes of her vaccination today.  She felt well, without respiratory distress or urticaria. Later on, she developed some tingling in the right palm and part of her forearm.  Her vaccination was on the left side.  There were no visible changes associated with these symptoms.   O: I personally witnessed the spontaneous appearance of small petechiae on patient&#39;s forearm.  She had about 10 of them on either forearm and a couple on her shoulders.   No erythema, rash, wheals.   BP128/66 P 70 sPO2 100% RR 12     A:  I was unsure regarding the importance of this finding, so I called emergency department and conferred with one of the MDs there.  We felt that, since the patient was in no distress, and this condition was not getting worse, we would allow her to head home.   After a total of an hour of monitoring, no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis or respiratory distress of any sort had emerged.

                                                Upon resting later the day of my vaccine at home, my left arm because extremely painful and sore. Which I found to be normal and expected. However, I became very exhausted suddenly and ended up falling asleep 2-3 hours before my normal bedtime.  I woke up 12 hours later unable to motivate myself to get out of bed. Finally, I did and went to go take a shower. I had chills as soon as I got out of bed and had to sit down in the shower for 10 minutes out of exhaustion and had the water running extremely hot but I was still cold. My arm was still in extreme pain. Finally, I arose from the shower floor and began showering when I started to feel as if I was going to puke right away. I laid down in the shower quickly becoming dizzy, and tried to puke. I dry heaved once to no avail. Immediately after dry heaving, my ears went numb and the shower noise was barely audible. My hands went completely numb. Home alone, I knew I needed to get out of the shower before I passed out. I managed to step out of the shower before immediately falling and possibly blacking out for some seconds and fell to the floor and laid there for a minute. Finally, I was somehow able to grab a towel and struggle to my bedroom and laid there numb for about 10 minutes.  This episode ended at about noon but for the rest of the day, I had to sleep on and off, it exhausted me to try and eat,  I had hot flashes, more dizziness, arm pain, and nausea. I called the doctor and they said there was nothing they could do and my symptoms were normal since I had COVID-19 in December.

Within a few minutes I heard the patient&#39;s mom calling out for help. I quickly ran over to help. I observed the patient who was now sitting on the floor. Her eyes were wide and she looked shocked. I helped her mother to calm patient and asked her to remain seated. I asked her mom what happened and she stated patient twitched a couple of times and began to fall off of her chair at which point mom caught her.  Mom had blood on her arm and I noticed it had come from patient&#39;s ear where a couple of earrings were pulled as she fell. I asked if she wanted water and quickly provided her a bottle of water. Mom stated that patient had fainted from vaccine(s) in the past, but mom stated that this appeared to look like a seizure. Mom went to get a chocolate bar since patient had had nothing to eat and they were worried about low blood sugar. After patient looked like she was back to normal I left to administer another vaccine but asked mom to remain until she felt necessary. Mom and patient advised my tech that they were ok and they left the store.

                                                I Received the shot at 10:45am on April the 15th, no side effects except arm soreness afterward. Then at around 7:40pm that same night, I began getting terrible itchy on my face, back, arms, and neck. It worsened and I started having trouble breathing (it felt like my throat had tightened)/a hoarse voice, and my pulse was faster than usual and I felt woozy and tired.. I called a nurse hotline and she recommended for me to be seen at an ER, and I went home to tell my parents and they called a doctor friend, and I was told to take Benadryl and if anything got worse to go to the ER. The next day when I woke up I felt mainly tired and had a slight cough and was scheduled a telehealth appointment, and I am taking Zyrtec 10mg and Pepsin 20mg daily x one week with Benadryl as a back up in case the symptoms flare up, and am advised to go to the ER if the breathing issues return. In terms of symptoms now, I am just a little itchy.

                                                9 days ago, got Pfizer vaccine #1. Immediately after vaccine, felt nausea, lightheaded. She was sitting in a chair and felt unable to sit in chair, needed support. &#34;It was too much work to talk, knew answers, hard to speak.&#34; No LOC. BIBA to ED. Athol ED notes reviewed, found to be anemic (drew off IV), subsequently not confirmed. She has ongoing nausea (without vomiting), poor appetite (eating toast with avocado, pizza pockets), fatigue (slept 11 hours and felt tired on awakening, napping), shaky (whole body), weak (unable to break apart frozen bread loaf, but no focal weakness), high HR on ambulation (on apple watch, 170-180, even 200), vertigo (when turns head, feels tilting or rarely spinning, lasting a few seconds or minutes), gets cold very easily, throat felt and appeared to be jumping, maybe a little hard to swallow. Per mother (by text) she is &#34;shell of her former self.&#34; Works front desk  has missed work except yesterday when she was able to get through a 3 hour shift. Cognition is mostly intact. She and mom do not know what to attribute this to. She if feeling better than after she left the hospital, better for a while, some worse now but not as bad as immediately after. No CP, no cough, fever. She has felt a little SOB last week, maybe after standing or taking a few steps.

                                                On 4/18/21, it was reported that the patient had a seizure following the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine.  This is a 19 year old female patient with a known history of a seizure disorder.  She has been under the care of a neurologist x 6 years, is not on any seizure medications, and no diagnosis made.  She reports she has a seizure every two weeks, which are triggered by anxiety/stressful events.  On this day, 3 minutes after received the 2nd dose in the supine position, she fell unconscious and developed eyelid and arm twitching.  Vitals signs remained stable.  MD described seizure as &#39;starting as a sleep state, moving to slight twitching, then tonic clonic.  Duration of seizure symptoms was 12 minutes. &#39;  The patient regained consciousness, symptoms resolved, and patient was discharged home with family following increased observation.  No medication treatment needed.  Upon chart review, it was identified that she has a similar reaction following her 1st Pfizer dose.  On 3/28/21, the patient received Pfizer (Lot ER8730 in the left deltoid).  Following her 15 minute observation period, she rose from her chair and fell to the ground unconscious.  She was taken to the treatment tent and observed to have &#39;seizure like jerking of upper and lower extremities, fluttering eyelids, unarousable.&#39;  Vitals stable (BP=103/68, HR =111, SpO2=98%).  Patient and family described this seizure as similar to the ones she experiences due to stress/anxiety.  Symptoms resolved, no medication treatment needed.  She was advised to follow-up with PCP regarding 2nd dose, and if proceeds, recommended to lie down in treatment tent for 2nd dose (which was then done on 2nd dose).  Patient reported that she has not had seizures with other vaccine administrations.

The clinical team transferred patient to the Assessment Tent, where she was observed to have seizure-like jerking of her upper &amp; lower extremities and fluttering of the eyelids while she remained unconscious. She had normal pulse and respiration during this time, no tongue biting or urinary or stool incontinence. Within approximately 10 minutes her seizure-like movements resolved, and she gradually regained consciousness. I spoke with the patient afterwards: she recalls having stood to meet with her father, and then she has no recollection of the event.

                                                I got my first vaccine dose on March 21. On March 27, i started developing a rash in my armpit. when i went to the urgent care, i was given a steroid cream to apply to my armpit. within 4 days of using the steroids the rash had went down significantly. Around April 1, i started feeling a burning, stinging, uncomfortable, sensation near my vagina. Shortly after i went to an urgent care, again. When i went to the urgent care i prescribed two other creams, one being a medicated steroid i was told to put around my vagina. After two weeks of still being uncomfortable, i made an appointment with my gynecologist. My gynecologist took cultures, to find that i had a minor yeast infection, which i took monistat for, and it cleared up within a day. The pain was still persistent so I made a follow up appointment with my gynecologist, and she says everything seems to be normal. I?ve seen 4 different doctors who cannot tell me what is medically wrong with me, but i have never had any problems like this before receiving the vaccine.

Important to note that I have epilepsy, but I had not run into any typical triggers that could have caused the seizure. Seemed like a reaction to the shot, but maybe not.

A 19-year-old female patient received bnt162b2, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received a call saying that her first dose was invalid because it had not been properly stored, there was a quality assurance measure that was done and the cold chain temperure had been broken. She believes she got some immunity from the first vaccine though because her arm hurt and she slept for 12 hours after the vaccine. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 19-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EW0158), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 15Apr2021 10:00 as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included gastritis and sensitive stomach from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no history of COVID prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (NIKKI); pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PROTONIX); and an unspecified vitamin, all taken for an unspecified indication. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on an unknown date, for Covid-19 immunization. The patient received her second dose on 15Apr2021, Thursday, and on 16Apr2021, Friday night, she got a mild headache.

She was hospitalized until 20Apr2021, Tuesday, and was found to have mononucleosis. Cough developed and ended Tuesday, 20Apr2021. Beginning 20Apr2021 onward, the muscle aches were the biggest complaint, she can&#39;t be standing for more than a few minutes or her legs begin to cramp up. Headaches and dizziness continued. Sore throat stopped, and fever began to subside. On 19Apr2021, the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included platelet count: abnormally low, Nasal Swab/PCR: negative, and white blood cell count: 1.8. The events resulted in Doctor or healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, and events from 19Apr2021 caused hospitalization until 20Apr2021.

A 19-year-old female non-pregnant patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 19-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no history of COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine: 2nd dose of Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine on 06Apr2021 in the right arm. On 20Apr2021 22:30, the patient experienced passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, enlarged heart, and nausea.  The patient reported, &#34;I was fine all day until around 10:30 pm I went into my mothers room and she was asking me how my arm feels I told her it was fine and right after saying that she said I passed out in front of her and then I began to have a seizure for about 50 seconds and then I woke up. After waking up from the event I had a hurt knee and sore mouth as well as an enlarged heart. I have no history of seizures in the past so it was definitely scary.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures taken included anti seizure meds, fentanyl, and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient recovered with sequelae from the events, passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, and enlarged heart. Outcome of nausea was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time.

                                                About 10 hours after my second dose, I began to have muscle pain. The muscle pain is different than body aches that I?ve gotten with a cold. My muscles hurt and my skin is sensitive to the touch. It feels like the pain goes from the skin to the bone. I don?t know how else to describe it other than  feeling like a bad a sinus infection inside of my muscles. I know that?s a weird way to describe it but the pain is kind of indescribable and unique. The pain is worst in my neck and back. My joints also feel inflamed, it?s hard to close my hands into a fist. I spent most of the night freezing cold and shivering (I live without air conditioning).  It has been  about 35 hours since I received the vaccine. Cold and shivering has subsided but I have have the sweats for the past 8 or so hours. A bit of nausea and stomach pain started about 15 hours after the vaccine.

                                                We left the store and got a bite to eat at the drive through. After driving about 7 minutes she grabbed her throat and started acting like she was not able to swallow. I asked her was she ok? She stated no in a raspy voice. She shook her head and said she felt like molasses was in her throat. She seemed pale and began to sweat. I am a former EMT-Parmamedic. I remembered there was a store about 2 miles away. I called  and got the Pharmacist on the phone. I ran into the  after driving 92 miles an hour and she converted children&#39;s Benadryl for me and stayed on the phone. I gave her 1/2 a bottle. began to be more responsive. I had a medical bag with me with airways and other medical devices I use for work but no Epi Pen. After giving her all the Benadryl she said she felt better but she stayed hoarse for the remainder of the day and was sleepy. I kept an eye on her an Called her physician on Monday morning as this was a Saturday and they called in Epi pens in case this happens again. The first shot she felt like she swallowed a potato chip wrong and started acting the same way then through up but never got this bad. We just thought she ate something and it went down the wrong way. Never giving it a second thought. Then after the second shot it was much worse. Had I not the pharmacist on the phone, Benadryl liquid and a medical bag, I would have called an ambulance. In the county we live in though we do not have enough ambulances and I am afraid she would have went into full anaphylaxis and died. I did what I thought was the best for my only child.

We administered the Pfizer shot in the left arm and was asked to stay in the store for 15 to 20 minutes to make sure she di not have an adverse reaction. She walked to the front of the store and and started felling dizzy, therefore, mom had patient sit down on the floor. Our store manager noticed she was on floor and cam over to offer assistance. Pt&#39;s mom said she pass out and was not feeling good. I was paged and upon going to front of the store saw the patient on the floor. I came up to and ask how she&#39;s feeling and noticed she was flushed and warm. An associate got her some water and a chair. Our store manager offered to call 911 and mom did not want an ambulance called and after 15 to 20 minutes of sitting in the chair drinking water, patient was able to leave the store with no assistance. I called to check on Pt at 5:30pm and she was feeling good with no other issues.

By 30 minutes afterward, it had made my whole arm feel numb including my fingers.  I took Tylenol and Benadryl and iced the areas.  Swelling and numbness persisted for the next 3-4 hours. I was fine the next morning as far as I could tell.

                                                My daughter was fine on the first day.  She woke up the next day with a weird headache that her scalp hurt.  She went into work and started to feel poorly throughout the day.  When she came home, she went to bed at 4:30 pm as she had aches &amp; pains, continued headache, felt nauseous, tired, and noticed her left leg where she had surgery previously was bothering her with pins and needles. I told her to go to bed and she would be fine the next day. On 5/26, her leg was giving her increased problems where she could not flex her foot, nerve pain in her leg along with numbness, and she still had the headache. I told her to call her primary care physician and the nurse had her go the the ER.  They ran no tests, but consulted with neuro on call and surgeon who performed surgery on her leg two years ago.  She was instructed to follow-up with a neuro and start PT.  We got her into a PT. The next day she continued to have same issues, but her leg pain increased.  She followed up via phone twice to primary where the nurse told her to go back to the ER. She had blood work, ultra sound and x-ray.  She saw neurologist on  6/2 and is scheduled for follow-up with an EMG on 6/14.  She has seen physical therapist 6x since 5/26 and still has numbness, nerve pain, etc.  The form from neuro office said left foot drop and parathesia. She has had headaches this week including a migraine on 6/8.

Immediate Reaction (onset &lt;5 min) associated with the following symptoms:  ? Visible swelling and pain at the injection site  ? Increased nasal secretions and eye tearing ? Chills Around 30 minutes after, she had also developed: ? Swelling of the tongue (felt &#34;heavy&#34;) ? Flushing, diaphoresis, and nausea, followed later by vomiting ? Dizziness/lightheadedness/weakness ? Dyspnea, wheezing, and cough ? Hives on arms and chest    No throat tightening or tachypnea. She did not attempt speech.  No one in the clinic took her blood pressure or pulse ox   The patient brought her epi pen with her but elected not to use it. Left after 30 minute observation period.  Thinks that the people at the vaccine clinic did not recognize that she had hives because of her dark complexion.  The people administering vaccines were not medically trained    Patient&#39;s mom recognized that she was not feeling well when she picked her up.  She took benadryl which helped with allergy symptoms.  She then developed fever up to 102.3, chills, headache, nausea, and myalgias x 5 days

                                                Pt is a female on birth control (Nexplanon, left arm) and has not had her menstrual cycle since 9/2019. After receiving the COVID vaccine, pt experienced severe cramps and began her menstrual cycle with heavy flow. This is a manageable adverse reaction, but important to consider when administering COVID vaccines to female pts and how they might interfere with fertility, menstruation, and hormones.

The person observing her noticed she seemed  zoned out and asked how she was doing at about 2:17 and learned that her tingliness was  turning into numbness of  extremities focused on her upper body.  She started displaying other symptoms of a minor panic attack.  We monitored her for the full 30 minutes, had her walk around, drink water, etc. She claimed that while her numbness wasn&#39;t getting better, it also wasn&#39;t getting worse. It was starting to itch though, so she was given some benedryl.  She then went home for the evening where her roommate could monitor her.   Next day, she called in to confirm that her numbness/itchiness had turned into a rash on her chest which has disappeared. But now is experiencing diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness.  She was informed that these symptoms were within the normal range of immune responses, but that if she was too miserable, she could go in to urgent care for medical assistance. She declined to do so at that time (approximately 11:45 am).

Had headache for the rest of the day until 7pm but was not a migraine after the nap and Tylenol. I would never get this vaccine again. I would rather have covid 1000 more times. (I had it in October and no sickness I?ve ever had will ever compare to that two hours of hell.

                                                Patient reported symptoms of: tachycardia, shakiness, vision changes, tongue numbness and shortness of breath following the first dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine on 2/5/2021. Patient said that historically has experienced tachycardia and shakiness after getting a flu shot or booster a few years ago. Symptoms reported by patient were enough to suspect potential anaphylaxis, and patient consented pharmacist to administer epinephrine. Patient was then advised by the pharmacist to follow-up with her primary care doctor as soon as possible to report the incident and to discuss the risk versus benefit of the vaccine, whether recieving the second dose would be appropriate for her. Patient returned to assisted living facility for her second dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 2/26/2021. Patient said that she discussed the incident with her doctor, was told it would be appropriate to get the second dose despite her reaction and was advised to take &#34;cautious measures&#34;. Pharmacist reviewed the patient information and screening questions, discussed the potential side effects and reiterated her risk of experiencing the same reaction with the second dose. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Pharmacist asked patient if she had any questions/concerns or additional information to add prior to getting her vaccine, and patient denied having any at that time. After administering her second dose, pharmacist instructed patient to stay in the observation area for at least 30 minutes and to ask the staff for water given her experience with the first dose.  Patient asked pharmacist how common it was for someone to get a reaction from the vaccine, and then mentioned that her family memeber had to drive her to the emergency room after her first dose becuase her throat was &#34;burning&#34;, and was told that her throat was &#34;a little swollen&#34; and recieved a second dose of epinephrine at the emergency room. Patient included this information after the fact her second dose was already administered.  Approximately 5 minutes after receving her vaccine, the patient reported similar symptoms that she experienced on 2/5/2021: tachycardia, vision changes, shortness of breath and chest tightness. After monitoring patient with no resolvement of her symptoms, patient was then given a dose of epinephrine by the pharmacist, and the paramedics were called in to assess patient and take her to the emergency room.

                                                About an hour (5:30pm est) after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on my left arm (taken Saturday, March 6th at around 4:30pm est) I started feeling itchy all over my body (neck, stomach, sides, thighs) and it looked like a rash (very red) showing me signs of an allergic reaction. The same thing happened throughout the day on Sunday (March 7th) and the rash would get better and then worsen so it was very on and off throughout my entire body. On Sunday evening after I took 2 Benadryls the rash got worse on my right arm and a small area of my left arm (bubbly-like features appeared). I went to sleep after taking the Benadryl and when I woke up the next morning it was completely gone. Then on Monday (March 8th) I was fine all day no signs of rashes or itching and then around 5pm I felt a burning sensation on my face and when I looked in the mirror both of my cheeks and a small part of my forehead were extremely red. I then took 2 Benadryls again and went to bed. Today (March 9th) I do not have signs of a rash and have not felt itchy all day.

The &#39;blister&#39; is on my right hand index finger (measured 9 mm by 7 mm at its widest points, has not changed size or character since appearing) with a fainter in color &#39;blister&#39; (5 mm by 3 mm at widest) present on my right hand pinkie. No &#39;trauma&#39; to the site. Nonblanching, two petechiae present within the ring finger&#39;s blister, two also present in the one on my pinky. Those petechiae have disappeared in the last two days, but the spots are still present. Red, not warm, sensitive to touch. I had no other symptoms from dose one of the vaccination, outside of a sore arm and some joint pain. Possibly fatigue, but that&#39;s likely just me being fatigued as per usual.

Pt was sitting in chair and was lowered to the floor when she slumped and started to have a seizure.  As soon as she was on the floor she snapped awake.  She was disoriented for a moment but was aware.  After a few minutes she sat back down in chair and her blood pressure was taken.  it was 139/81 with HR of about 79.  The fire department came in at this point.  Eventually, the fire dept released her as she was with her mother.

                                                Part one: Within one minute of injection, I was extremely dizzy and had to force myself to breathe. My hearing became muffled and I couldn&#39;t hear. I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

No signs of allergy, had cold hands. Symptoms indicated syncope but witnesses mentioned they saw her having a small seizure, where she threw her hands and head back before sliding down. 911 was called, they checked her and walked her to her car and let her go with a friend.

                                                chest pain; tachycardia; cold sweats; shakes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 20-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on an unspecified date (at the age of 20-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) administered in arm left on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient ended up in the hospital with chest pain, tachycardia, shakes and cold sweats, 5 hours after receiving second dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: unknown results on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine can not be excluded for the reported events of chest pain, tachycardia, shakes and cold sweats due to temporal relationship.  Case will be re-assessed upon the additional information provided. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Upon administration, patient reported she felt as though she was having an anxiety attack. She then fainted and started falling forward in her chair. The pharmacist and technician caught the patient as she fell forward and as they were leaning her back in the chair she began seizing in their arms for approximately 5-10 seconds (no more than 20-30 seconds). At this point, the patient spoke and stated that was weird and said she felt lethargic. Another technician was on the phone with 911 at this time. We gave her a bottle of water and kept the patient seated in the immunization room until EMS arrived. She was complaining of being very hot and lethargic. EMS arrived and checked her vitals and recommended the patient go with them to the hospital due to B/P and pulse being very low (exact vitals were not communicated to us). She agreed to go to the hospital and we will be following up with the patient tomorrow.

I got stung by a bee in my upper chin near my lower lip about 3 hours after injection so I don&#39;t know what symptoms are caused by what but I also experienced a lump in my right lymphnode.

                                                On 3-15-21 patient received 1st dose Pfizer vaccine on L deltoid, states that 2 days after the jab she developed a pruriginous rash on ventral aspect of L forearm above wrist area. Rash faded away on its own. Denied SOB, wheezing, cough, facial swelling. denied any rashes on other areas of her body. she did not disclose that rash to us at the clinic. On 04/05/21 she came to the clinic for 2nd jab, on screening and immunization documentation she mark no on &#34;like to speak with health care provider&#34; but prior to HS providing 2nd jab she brought to her attention the previous symptoms. I intervene and discuss with the patient and asked the nature of the previous symptoms. Due to a miscommunication and misunderstanding, on my part, I thought that her rash was initially on site of injection and that it spread distally, discuss with her Covid arm for about 10-15 minutes with patient as I thought initially that it was a COVID arm and proceed to allow 2nd jab and order to keep her in observation for 30&#39;. 2nd jab administered on R arm this time. About 3 minutes after jab, she developed  three lesions on forearm, 2 bumps approximately .2 cm diameter, with mild hyperemia on dorsal aspect of proximal forearm which states were itching. Stated one hyperemic non raised lesion on proximal ventral forearm (that latest lesion was not visualized by me). I extended the observation period and at 45&#39; the lesions started to fade away and the &#34;bumps&#34; got smaller. I did a full evaluation of the patient and there was no other skin lesions on rest of her body. she was breathing normally, no wheezings, no laryngeal stridor, no facial/neck/lips/tongue swelling, no complaints of tingling on lips or tongue. She was not on distress. No treatment provided to patient. Patient was discharge home with specific instructions to call 911, go to neares ER, or call the Duty HS if at any point she develops any new symptoms, breathing problems. Around 6:15 i call patient and told me she was doing good, no new skin lesion, no laboured breathing, wheezing, swelling, problems with swallow and that the lesions were gone. Today 4/6/21 I call patient to come to the clinic for re-assessment and there was no skin rashes, no swelling, her exam was completely normal. she complained of tender arm and that previous night she had some mild headache, took tylenol and better. There was no redness around injection site. Patient was discharged with same recommendations provided previously, to call 911, go to nearest ER, or call Duty HS if any new skin lesions, SOB, wheezing, difficulty swallowing or talking. Just spoke with patient via phone today at 4:25 PM and states she is doing well, no rash, no SOB, completely asymptomatic. I understand the magnitude of these events and I have to say the the misunderstanding was all on me and I take responsibility. Here in our clinic we have immunized over 600 patients and no major issues prior to this. I am available to discuss at any time. Thanks,

Then, I went to go sit in the waiting area, and I continued to get warmer and warmer. After 5 minutes, I went up to the front desk, and told them I didn?t feel well and that I felt like I was overheating. They put me in a wheelchair, and I immediately passed out and hallucinated for a minute or two. I felt incredibly weak, and I had sweat completely through my shirt. A paramedic came and put me in a stretcher in a cornered off area of the clinic. After 30 minutes or so, I started feeling better, but I got several spirts of cold flashes. All of my vitals came back normal.

Friday morning is when I really felt like an 8 and my listed symptoms weighed me down. I would define these symptoms as episodes. Each episode would last a couple of minutes and I would return to my normal state. I felt an 8 till the following Sunday/ Monday. Tuesday, felt a little better.

                                                Last night/this morning, I was sleeping and woke up around 5:30am to my right foot being completely numb. I could not curl my toes or move it at all. Eventually I massaged it and applied pressure enough to start feeling pins and needles up my whole lower leg, but they were much more painful than any pins and needles I&#39;ve felt before. At this point, I could move my toes again but it took several minutes for the pain to stop. I went back to bed with it still feeling slightly numb, but it has not gotten to the pins and needles stage since then. I still feel a slight tingling/numbness in my right leg now, but it is subtle and not painful.

                                                Before I went to bed at around 11:30pm the day of my shot (4/13), I took one extra strength tylenol as prevention. I woke up around 2:40am 4/14 trembling as if I was having a seizure (it did not feel like chills) and extreme aches. I took my temperature and was at 100.8. I took another extra strength tylenol and tried to calm down. At around 3:30 the trembling stopped and I was finally able to relax a bit. I fell back asleep around 5am and woke up at 9:00am with more extreme aches and pain. I switched to ibuprofen (400mg) and that worked way better. My fever was at 101.8 when I woke up. Around mid morning and afternoon I was feeling fine just a bit achy and fatigued and my fever broke to 99. I took a nap around 2pm and woke up feeling bad again with a fever of 100.6. I took another 400mg of ibuprofen and that got me through my class and the evening feeling okay. Before bed, I was feeling achy and fatigued yet again. I took 200mg of ibuprofen and went to bed just fine. I woke up at 4:30am 4/15 for my clinical feeling back to normal. I have been fine ever since.

Then later at night when I was trying to get to sleep I was horribly restless, shaking, and feverish. I had to bundle up in blankets because I was so cold. My whole body ached terribly, and I had a headache. It lasted a few hours and I couldn?t get to sleep. At one point I felt extremely nauseous and ran to the bathroom, barely holding back vomit, but then it went away and never came back. The day after that (April 15th) I was extremely fatigued and still had body aches and a headache. I took my temperature at 5 am on April 15th and it was 99.4°. I mostly just slept a lot and didn?t have much of an appetite. My arm was still a little sore during this whole time. As I?m writing this at 5 am on April 16th, I still have a headache.

Around 950ish PM my face started to feel a little warm, then about 15 mins later I looked in the mirror and my face was red all over and it continued to get worse. Currently it is 11:20 PM and my face still feels very warm and is a deep red. I would compare it to a bad sunburn. I took my temperature and it was at 99.4.

The next day the body soreness was severe enough to where it was painful to clench my fist or walk even a small distance. I also experienced nausea, loss of appetite, migraines and light sensitivity, and was unable to do normal tasks around the house for about 3-4 days. The full body soreness was the most debilitating symptom and certain aresa like elbows, knees, wrists and hips were painful to the touch. I think my joints were most affected. The soreness and pain can be compared to a flu but it was more intense than anything i have experienced before.

This is something that happens sometimes with my health issues. I think the second dose triggered my medical conditions and made me symptomatic. I haven?t had that happen in close to a year. Woke up around 11am on 4/21 with a bad headache, body pain, a sore arm, and feeling fatigued. Had to lay in bed until about 3pm when I finally started to feel a bit better.

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

                                                The following morning I received the first dose of the vaccine, I woke up around 6 am to get some water. I then starting feeling severe cramping like menstrual cramps so I used a heating pad and fell back asleep. I woke up later the same day (4/24) and my period had started a few days earlier than expected. My last few cycles have started at the same time. My main concern were the severe cramps I had this morning as I have not had anything that serious before.

At around 2:15pm patient started to faint. Patient was accompanied by her mother. Rph on duty rushed to the scene noticed that patient had lost consciousness and started to have a seizure. I also noticed that the patient had passed urine while unconscious. I notified my technician to call 911. I quickly grabbed an EpiPen and administered one dose into the patient thigh. I assisted the patient along with her mother until the patient regained consciousness. Paramedic arrived to the seen few mins later. They checked all vital signs and patient was responding better and but still exhibiting some tingling effect in her hands. Patient decided not to ride with the paramedics. I advised her to stay for another 30 - 45 min so that I could monitor her. She was feeling much better and was released to go home along with a EpiPen.

After5-10 minutes later, she complained about numbness on her extremities and tingling sensation on her finger and she still experiencing tremors.  We had to call the ambulance and they arrived within 5-7 minutes.

                                                Immediately after receiving the Pfizer injection, I began to feel lightheaded and dizzy. Moments after that, I felt a general sense of unease and began feeling too hot. I was nauseated, sweating, shaking, experienced tingling in the hands and feet, tunnel vision, and temporary loss of hearing. Within 10 minutes, these had all subsided, and after my 15 minutes of waiting was up, I was allowed to leave with no further adverse reactions.

Symptoms included headache, loss of sensation in arms, light headedness.  Patient appeared pale, and confused.  Attempted to have patient stand up and walk to counsel room opposite where she was sat.  After standing, she immediately sat down, and fainted while she was seated.  Pharmacist supported her head, and her boyfriend/significant other prevented her from falling off the chair.  Patient was momentarily unresponsive for about 3 seconds.  During this time her eyes remained open.  Once patient regained consciousness, walked her to counsel room and had her lie down on her back with her legs elevated on a chair.  Blood pressure was within normal limits.  Patient was feeling better in about 10 minutes, and continued to monitor for another 5.  Gave water to sip on, and no additional adverse effects noted.

After two hours, the chills stopped but my fever was still at 102. I went back to sleep at 3:00 am and woke up without a fever but still felt very tired and groggy for the next two days. Also, am not sure if it is related, but I am usually very regular on my menstrual cycle, but was 20 days late after getting the first vaccine. I know this because I track my menstrual cycle. Also, when my period did finally come, it was the most painful period that I have had in a while. The cramping was very painful and I bled very heavily.  Although, I got my second shot on the 27th of May and had no symptoms. I also, to my knowledge, did not have covid prior to getting either shot.

A 20-years-old female patient (daughter) received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8733, Expiry date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in right upper arm on 20May2021 13:30 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medication was not reported. Patient historical vaccination was Flu vaccine on an unknown date in Sep2020 for immunization and first dose of BNT162B2 lot Number ER8733, Expiry Date: Jul2021 on 29Apr2021 at right upper arm for COVID-19 immunization and patient experienced little sore arm but it was no big deal. On 20May2021 patient experienced sore arms, had chills, her hands were very cold and her fingernails were purple. For a 3 hour period she had low grade temperature of 103.2F. Her heart was racing very fast. The mother gave her Tylenol in 15ml liquid form at 04:00 am and the temperature went down to 2 degrees. Her heart was still racing very fast at 5am. 3 hours later at 08:00 am her temperature was 101.5 F more Tylenol was given but her heart was still racing fast. Later that day it settled down. Her temperature went down to maybe a hundred and heart rate was slowly settling down. The mother said that it was really scary. They had call the doctor on Friday and talked with the nurse two times and the nurse said that they never heard anyone experienced a fever that high with the vaccine. She is asking if this was normal and if anyone has experienced this before. She is asking if ever there would be a third or booster dose, can her daughter take it after experiencing side effects after the second dose. She went back this past Thursday 20May2021 around 1:30pm for the second dose and she felt fine. About 10 hours later that night, she started not feeling well. She had gotten her second dose 3 days before and had a low grade fever, body aches, chills and didn&#39;t feel well for 24 to 48 hours. She started not feeling well and started getting chills. She was shaking really bad at 1:00 in the morning. She really didn&#39;t feel good. She took her temperature and it was 100.5. Her hands were freezing and her finger nails were purple. Her hands were cold and she was getting a fever. She guesses that can happen. Lasted a little longer from 1:00 until about 3:30 in the morning. Caller was up with her the entire night. Her fever went up to 103.2. Her heart was beating really fast. Caller was getting really scared and was thinking about taking her to the emergency room. She thought this was really weird. She gave her Tylenol trying to hold off. She was trying not to give her too much because there are dozens of interactions. She needed to give her something. Within an hour, it brought her fever down about 2 degrees and was then around 101.5. Her heart rate was still pretty fast. Was still a bit concerned but was glad her fever went down. Other than that, she seemed fine. Her daughter was drinking a lot of water to keep hydrated and was peeing a lot because she was drinking so much water. She seemed okay after that but her heart was still beating faster. Her daughter got up, she didn&#39;t sleep very much, and got up around 8:00 am, about 4 hours after taking the Tylenol. She didn&#39;t have a high fever but it was still around 101. She gave her more Tylenol and her heart was still beating fast. Reporter did not time it to see how fast it was. She could just tell that it was beating fast, like she was doing aerobics or something. Her daughter got the shot in her right arm. It really felt lumpy under her arm pit. Caller had read that some people get that, their lymph nodes get inflamed. Consumer only gave those 2 doses of Tylenol, her daughters fever got better. Her heart rate went back to normal and she seems fine now. She said her lymph nodes under her right arm seem like they are feeling better- before, she couldn&#39;t even put her arm down because they hurt so bad. She does seem to have improved; This was last Thursday and this is Tuesday. She did call the doctors office and talked to the nurse who said she hadn&#39;t heard of a fever that high. Said that sometimes when people get a fever, their heart rate can increase and that it is not unheard of. She didn&#39;t think that she had to be seen because she was improving. It bothered her the next few days. She heard on TV that kids were getting heart inflammation. Heart beating really fast: Reporter felt her wrist and felt her heart beating really fast. Lasted a little longer, until about 3:30 in the morning. Her daughters heart was beating so fast, it felt as if she were exercising but, she was sitting still. Her daughter seems fine now and caller has been checking her every day. Arm sore and lumpy under arm pit: This happened the next morning, Friday. Her daughter felt like she couldn&#39;t move and wanted to take a shower. She felt so sweaty and she couldn&#39;t touch her arm pit because it hurt so much. Reporter had read that some peoples lymph nodes get inflamed. It seemed better as the day went on. Treatment: Had  only 2 doses of Tylenol. Her daughter doesn&#39;t swallow pills, so she had given her Children&#39;s strength Tylenol that is for children ages 2-11. She had only given her 15ml, which for her wasn&#39;t a lot. It says it&#39;s for up to 80 pound kids. Gave her 15ml at 04:00 am and it did bring it down 2 degrees. She gave her the same dose at 8:00 am. It wasn&#39;t even an adult strength dose. Fever: Her daughter&#39;s fever went away. She went back to bed, she had only slept from 05:00 am to possibly 08:00am, and didn&#39;t even sleep well then. After the second dose of Tylenol, her daughter went back to bed. Later in the afternoon, when her daughter got up, it seemed like she had a fever but a low grade fever, probably around 100. She hasn&#39;t seen it go back up. It seemed like it had settled down. Caller has been checking every day. Chills: Occurred after the second dose, maybe about 10 hours after on 20May2021.

The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing Tri-lo-sprintec (started taking it to regulate her cycle as she had an irregular period; she started this birth control 2 or 3 years ago). On 22May2021, the patient waited 15 minutes after the shot and felt fine, but later on that day (a couple of hours after) she got chills (about three hours after the vaccine). She stated she had normal side effects and did not think anything of it. On Sunday (23May2021), she had difficulty breathing (trouble breathing) and felt weak (feeling very weak and has no energy). She voiced it&#39;s hard for her to wear a mask. When she had to put a mask on it really felt like she could not breathe, and the air feels stuffy especially if she wears a mask; every couple of seconds she had to wear the mask under her nose because she could not breathe. Caller stated that she did not have this problem before receiving the COVID vaccine. On Monday (24May2021), she felt like she was coming down with a cold. Caller stated that she thought that might be her trouble breathing was from her cold-like symptoms, but she does not think it was, because she was not experiencing any cold-like symptoms on Sunday and was only having trouble breathing. She experienced coughing, sneezing, itching eyes/nose, chills, and headache. On Wednesday (26May2021), she started feeling nauseated (got very nauseous), not feeling good, she was getting a headache and had caught a cold. Caller stated she did not know if it was from vaccine shot but her eyes got itchy, her nose got itchy, and she kept sneezing and coughing. Yesterday (26May2021), the chills went away, she has not had any chills today, but she does not know if she will have any from this point on. She believed that she has recovered with lasting effects. Caller stated that not feeling well was ongoing and persisting, but then stated that she feels it was worsening. Yesterday, she just felt nauseous, today she woke up with her stomach hurting very badly and abdominal pain; her weakness has continued. Yesterday she took pantoprazole for the abdominal pain and Tylenol for the pain and headache. She stated that she had a slight headache that is now coming and going, clarifies that it is persisting. Caller thought the reason that her stomach is hurting was because of her stomach acid problem. She deals with a strict diet that she must follow for things she was not supposed to have. Since she had the COVID shot, she believes it was affecting the acid problems in her stomach. Caller clarified that she was calling to see what she should do, if she should go see a doctor or if this is normal. The outcome of events Dyspnoea, Asthenia, Sneezing, Headache, stomach hurting, Itchy was not resolved. The outcome of events of Nausea, started not feeling good, Cold like symptoms was resolving. The outcome of events chills was resolved with sequel on 26May2021, and Cough resolved with sequel on 25May2021. The outcome of Abdominal pain was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Since then she will wake up in the morning with a slight headache. Soreness in arm was when it was first administered (05Jan2021), that was normal and she usually gets soreness no matter what vaccines she gets. This lasted for 2 days and then went away. She did say that the flu vaccine and some other that she did not remember the name of were the ones she remembered getting sore from. She did not have a manufacturer, lot or expiration for any of them. The fourth day was when she had a sore throat and coughing, that started in the morning when she woke up around 10:00. She had it all day yesterday and it was pretty severe and then she started getting better later in the night. Today it was less, but still here. She did take something to try and make herself feel better, so it definitely helped. Loose stool improved and today (12Jan2021) was yet to be known. Loose stool started in the afternoon of 06Jan2021.

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep.

After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                The morning after my second dose of Pfizer?s Covid-19 vaccine, I woke up feeling freezing (at 9:00 am) and suspected I had a fever.  After waking up again later (around 12:30 pm), I took my temperature and found that I have a fever of 101°F.  I still have a fever and chills (2:50 pm).  I have not taken any medication to treat the fever yet and plan to just take it easy.  If I begin to feel worse, I might take an ibuprofen.  After getting the vaccine, my left shoulder was sore, and is still sore, but it?s my understanding that this is normal, and just as my arm was sore with the first vaccine, it may be 2 days before my arm feels better.  I am not concerned about the soreness of my arm.

                                                5 mins post 1st dose vaccination patient began feeling nauseous, throat felt tight with mild pain when swallowing, tingling sensation from the chest down to her toes, facial flushing, and dizziness. She states these symptoms are common due to her history of EDS but today they are slightly worse since she got the vaccine. She was brought to the medical evaluation area via wheelchair and evaluated by us and EMS. Patient was administered Benardyl 50mg and provided orange juice and water. Vitals taken throughout and were slightly high in the beginning and then stabilized. Patient states her throat felt better and the tingling localized to her hands after 5 mins. Patient was monitored for over 45 mins. She was instructed to contact her PCP and her allergist to be cleared for her second vaccine dose. She was informed her 2nd dose should be administered at a facility where she can be observed closely. She declined transport to the hospital but agreed to follow up to the ER with any worsening signs of anaphylaxis. The nausea resolved and she felt less groggy upon leaving with her boyfriend.

                                                Initially had localized redness, quarter to a half dollar sized swelling, on 3/10/2021. Patient received an iron infusion at 15:00 on 3/10/2021. Around 2:00 on 3/11/2021, patient felt a chill, her temperature was 100.4 F orally. Temperature further increased to 103 F around 13:00 on 3/12/2021.   What happened as a result of the adverse event? (doctor visit, ED or urgent care visit, hospitalization, life threatening illness, disability/permanent damage, death, none of these): none of these, took OTC apap last night and this morning and just took ibuprofen after the 103 F reading.  Spoke with patient&#39;s mother, who stated that the is feeling fine. The patient&#39;s temperature is currently 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and initially came back to normal at 02:00 today (3/13/21). The patient experienced elevated temperatures before that time (02:00), of note was at 22:00 on 3/12/21, at which time the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. A later temperature after 22:00 on 3/12/21, and before 02:00 on 3/13/21, was recorded, which was 101 degrees Fahrenheit.   The patient&#39;s mother stated that the daughter may have COVID based upon speaking with her doctor, so she inquired if her daughter should be tested for the presence of antibodies against COVID-19. Patient&#39;s mother also inquired if there was a need for the second shot if it was seen that her daughter had antibodies against the virus.  Advised the mother that her questions would be looked into for answers, and that she would be called back with those answers.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 09:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No family history relevant to adverse events. Patient has no concomitant medications. On 16Jan2021 09:20, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient felt like she was going to pass out reported as vasovagal reaction, and experienced heart beat was high, fatigue, woozy/dizzy, hard to concentrate, feeling hot, and felt as though she was on the verge of a headache but never got one/she felt like the blood was rushing to her head. On 16Jan2021 10:00, 1 hour after vaccination, the patient experienced had to fall asleep. On the day she got the shot she sat for a full hour with the nurse to be monitored. Then she went home. The events lasted from 09:20 until 18:00 on that day. 13 days after vaccination on 29Jan2021, 12:00 and ongoing until reporting time, the symptoms recurred about the same when they started. The patient was wondering if this could be a side effect 2 weeks after getting the shot or if she should look elsewhere on what could be causing these events. She is supposed to get the second dose on Friday and was wondering about getting the second dose after her experience. Patient wanted to know it is safer for her to have the 2nd dose. No physician office visit and emergency room visit. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was recovered on 16Jan2021 18:00.

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

Not exactly painful, but aching and deeply affecting. Almost itchy like all my muscles needed to stretch but they were also exhausted. All nerves in my body were highly activated, including my taste buds. Could not taste because I could taste everything and the food ended up feeling like individual particles rather than a cohesive flavor. Some nasal congestion. Overall, felt like being sick, but worse. Exhaustion Soreness in left arm

                                                I received my shot at 11:47 and started to lose sensation in my hands in the waiting area. After about 25 minutes I felt dizzy and was about to stand up but my muscles started shaking. My heart rate was checked and found to be 140. This lasted for about another 30 minutes. My heart rate went down and I was taken to a private area and checked out by EMS they gave me water and concluded it was some sort of panic attack. However, these are the same symptoms I have whenever I am allergic to a medication, NSAIDS, dicyclomine, etc. It always starts with ascending numbness from my fingers to the rest of my body. Then I start to shake and my heart rate goes way up. Usually I start to cough then vomit and my airway closes. Thankfully this time we were able to slow the process and I never experienced some of the last symptoms.

                                                Patient was nervous before the vaccination. After vaccination she started to feel hot and cold. Her hearing started to fade in and out. She sought help and was directed to lay flat on the floor and breathe. She started feeling light headed and that her vision was tunneling. Her appearance was pale and her hands were clammy. Her blood pressure was taken via wrist and was normal for her (112/72). The medical professional tending to her had her continue talking, asked her to state her DOB, name, age, the date, etc.  After about 5 minutes she started to feel better- she sat up and had some water and M&amp;Ms. She then laid back down but continued to converse with us. This took place over about10 minutes from first symptoms. She remained laying down for about 10 minutes after and then slowly sat up, and when she felt comfortable sitting she tried standing up. She then went home for the day (was an employee of the store).

About 40 minutes prior I had a snack and immediately after the shot I had another snack. I also had been drinking water. At one point I felt that I was close to passing out. I also had tingling/numbness in my feet/legs in certain positions and had to move them. I went through the drive through for the vaccine and so I sat in the car drinking water and breathing deeply for about 20-30 minutes. It gradually got better but never fully gone. When I got home some of the light headedness got a little worse when I had to stand up and walk even though I did it slowly. Even an hour after, side effects still lingering and have not yet gone as I fill this out.

About an hour after that I vomited and experience diarrhea. Returning to bed I had trouble sleeping due to the chills and headache bordering on migraine. Once I did fall asleep I would wake up dripping in sweat and needing to go to the bathroom for more diarrhea. This continued for several hours and several trips to the bathroom. The whole day after my vaccine I was unable to eat food, even the smell made me want to throw up. I was cold and nauseous all day.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm on 11Mar2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low thyroid. There were no concomitant medications. After receiving the shot of the vaccine on 11Mar2021 16:00, the patient stood up and started to feel dizzy. She was able to find a nearby chair and fainted when she sat down. When she woke up seconds later of fainting, she felt throat pain like strep throat pain and then she started feeling very intensive cramps in her lower abdomen like very intense period cramps for about 10 minutes. The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital. But it was an immediate reaction that affected 3 different parts of her body that was very painful. During the day and the day after she felt very weak with no energy to get out of bed. &#34;I am wondering if I can still receive the second dose after this reaction to the first dose?&#34; No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient was not pregnant. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy drug store. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                I started out having normal, expected lethargy, but it quickly got worse to the point where I was drooling slightly, my breathing slowed down for about half an hour (4:30-5pm), my speech was slurred and slowed, and my mood and behavior were somewhat erratic for about an hour (4:30-5:30pm). A friend I talked to on the phone while these symptoms were ongoing described me as sounding ?kinda drunk.?

                                                I felt severe arm pain after the injection.  About 12 hours later I had a fever of 100.1 and went to bed.  At 1 am I went to the restroom and passed a good deal of blood as I am on my period.  I got up and then fell to the floor.  Then I went to my parents bedroom and fell again.  I drank two bottles of water and took Tylenol at that point and after about two hours I felt better and went to sleep.  I also twisted my ankle when I fell the first time.  I have never fainted nor have I had such severe cramps or passed so much blood associated with a period.

                                                Saturday morning, the arm felt sore - I did notice a little red spot. I felt fatigue and a slight headache. Saturday night  to Sunday morning , the spot got bigger (on the injection site). I drew a circle around it. It got a little bigger on Sunday. They other symptoms subsided at the end of Sunday.  The redness didn&#39;t seem to be going away on the injection site. On Monday, I just had the red arm and it hurt pretty bad to touch. It was tender and warm to the touch. I was at work and I felt shortness of breath just walking down the hall. I took my pulse while I was standing still and it was about 120. Near the afternoon, I was instructed to go to URGENT CARE to get it checked out. Closer to the afternoon, I started noticing that the heartrate  (on my watch) it got to 164. I went to URGENT CARE and they stated it was a normal reaction to vaccine but because of my tachycardia they wanted to send me to Hospital ER. At ER they weren&#39;t worried about injection site (still pretty painful) they were worried about how fast my heartrate was going. The wanted me. The injection site and the tachycardia was back to normal.

She felt an improvement in breathing after about 60 seconds and it continued to improve. The patient was turned over to the paramedics and transported to hospital.  the  hospital where she was monitored and released later in the afternoon.

                                                Patient received her vaccine around 1:10 pm and was waiting in our lobby for the recommended 15 minutes. After 10 minutes, her body began to seize/shake for about 10-15 seconds and then she went completely limp in the chair she was seated in. I removed her mask to help with her breathing and lifted her head slightly. She began to seize/ shake again and then woke up. Patient was disoriented and reported of head pain, feeling  hot and rapid heart rate. We called 911 and EMT arrived a few minutes later, checked her vitals, which all came out normal, and spoke with the patient for a few minutes. Patient refused to go to the hospital and wanted to wait for her mother to arrive. She has no history of seizures and only takes Zyrtec OTC. The patient&#39;s mother arrived and spoke with the EMT personnel and I spoke with her as well. I recommended that the patient does not receive the second dose until she has been checked by a doctor and has been given approval to receive it. The patient recovered after about 20-30 min since the event and went home with her mother.

                                                Early the next morning (3:00 AM) I woke up with severe leg cramps and nothing would make them go away. I experienced sweating and chills every night for a week. On the early morning of 04/20/2021 at around 1:00 AM I experienced spasms in my face and tongue which made me see my doctor on 04/22/2021. Doctor ordered a comprehensive metabolic panel because he thought I might be dehydrated causing the cramps.

                                                I was working as the coordinator at on offsite vaccine event where primarily second doses of Pfizer Covid vaccine were being administered. I was pulled over by the nurse immediately following vaccination of the recipient. The nurse informed me that the recipient had provided her a consent form with Pfizer vaccine information and indicated that she was there for her second dose of Pfizer vaccine. The nurse administered the Pfizer Covid vaccine and then reviewed the vaccination record card presented by the recipient at which time she discovered that the first document a dose of Covid vaccine was Moderna. She immediately informed the recipient and the recipient did acknowledge to me that she had requested the Pfizer vaccination as her second dose because she thought that&#39;s what she had received. The recipient had received a consent form with the Pfizer lot number when she presented to the registration desk indicating that she was there to receive her second dose of Pfizer vaccine. I informed the recipient of the CDC guidance which indicates that no further doses are necessary when a mixed series of Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines are  administered. I suggested that she could choose to inform her healthcare provider and to certainly report any adverse effects. The recipient reported mild cramping in her left hand while we were talking to her during the post observation. And she indicated that this might have been a psycho somatic symptom. We asked the recipient to stay an additional 10 minutes beyond the 15 required minutes for observation. She reported no further issues and that the cramping in her hand had resolved. Her mother later called the health office regarding the medication error.

I was fine with these symptoms as I knew they were common side effects until my heart rate spiked from about 60 to the 160s and I began to have a throbbing headache. I could not get my heart rate to come down, I was calm and knew it was not anxiety so I went to the ER where they did blood tests, EKG, UA and gave me fluids. Everything came back normal but my heart rate continued to be elevated around 130s for a couple more hours, finally came down to about 100-110, HR is still slightly elevated and I still have a fever of 100.4 and migraine

                                                I woke up this morning with a very severe right dry eye. It was not responding to water or eye drops which is the first time that has ever happened to me. After several eye drops, I was able to drive to work where I was fine except for the eye pain until 10am. Then I started getting body aches, light-headedness and weakness. On the drive home (40 minutes), I developed a fever and the body aches worsened. If I do not consume liquid continuously, I get very light-headed and weak.

Was feeling well prior to that.  Has soreness at her arm as well.  She has a history of POTS and did detect a rapid heart rate at home.  She has mild sinus tachycardia at this time reports a gradual improvement in symptoms.  Fever is improving, had not had any antipyretic prior to coming in.  I have low suspicion for acute infection and would favor immune response to the vaccine itself which has been reported in multiple persons receiving same vaccine.  She is not hypoxic, has clear breath sounds.  No thrombocytopenia on CBC.  IV was placed, IV fluids given.  Heart rate improved, blood pressure remained stable.  Patient feels well enough for discharge on reevaluation and declined need for analgesic or antipyretic here.

Tried steam and heating pad, little improvement  - Jan. 26th Took ProAir inhaler at 2pm before shift     - Little improvement     - Pain still in chest - Called my primary Dr. at 4:30     - Prescribed prednisone and Advair     - Thinks vaccine caused inflammatory response  - Took prednisone at 8pm - Took Advair around 11 - Took ProAir inhaler around midnight  - Heart racing (HR130) - SOB, pain when breathing  - Localized to sternum, on either side as if something was grabbing my lungs and squeezing  - Feel like lightning coursing thru my veins - Shaky  I ended the up in the ER Jan. 26th.  * I took prednisone at 8pm * I took Advair at 11pm * I was still having trouble breathing and my last hit of my ProAir had completely worn off * I took my ProAir around midnight  * Over the course of the next two hours I was SOB, tachy (HR 130s), hot and cold flashes, pain while breathing, couldn?t catch my breath * My friends took me to the ER around 2am * At the hospital they did a 12 Lead EKG, blood work, labs, 2 chest X-rays, and a COVID-test * They gave me 0.5 mg lorazepam IV  * All of my blood work and labs came back normal.  * X-rays came back clear * EKG came back fine * Negative COVID test * I took a nap after the lorazepam hit and woke up feeling much better * ER doc thinks my ProAir exacerbated some anxiety because my lungs were clear and no wheezing  * Discharged me with a script for lorazepam PRN x10 and instructions to follow up with my primary is back at home.  * Doc said I could continue the prednisone and Advair  * Woke up today and yesterday feeling better, still some pain when breathing and exhausted. Pain is mostly at top of my lungs, going across my chest. Deep breathing sometimes helps but there?s also pain upon inhalation.  * Took the next doses of Advair and my Dexedrine (ADHD meds). Nothing weird yet just drained.   They switched my Ventolin inhaler to ProAir, I have been taking it about five times a week so I can workout. When I was on Ventolin I didn?t have any of the side effects I have with ProAir.

Within about 12 hours of my second covid vaccine, I started to become fatigued and had soreness in my arm. When I woke up the next morning (approx 20 hours post injection) I was drenched in sweat, fatigued, had a headache, body aches (back and neck), and a temperature of 100.9 (taken orally). The rest of the day I had hot/cold flashes. I would go from sweating to shivering every 10-20  minutes. I had a consistent fever of 100.3-100.7 until about 8pm when it read 96.5. I took Tylenol at 7am that day and ibuprofen at about 7pm. Hot/cold flashes continued through the night last night. I am still having cold/hot flashes (drenched in sweat then full body chills, but not shivering). I&#39;ve taken my temp multiple times today and it has consistently read at about 97.1 without fever reducing drugs. My body temp typically runs normal (98.6). I currently still feel fatigued, have a slight headache and some aching in my neck and back.

                                                Tingling throughout arm and into shoulder blade on 2 occasions throughout the day. Eyes felt swollen a few hours after receiving vaccine between 1-2 pm. Symptoms went away. At around 11pm I got welts and hives all over my body but they were particularly prevalent at the vaccine site. No change in routine throughout the day nor a change in food. Largely went away by the next day around 1pm. Still experiencing slight itchiness.

This lasted throughout the night (lasted 24 hours after vaccine administration). I had a lot of trouble sleeping due to the pain and temperature fluctuations (I would wake up hot and sweating, then an hour later cold and shivering, multiple times throughout the night). I treated the symptoms with Acetaminophen 500mg throughout the evening and the day after. The day after (24 hours later), I was fatigued and had stomach pains, with not much of an appetite.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient.  A 22-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose  of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sulfa allergy, depression, and anxiety. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included duloxetine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), citalopram (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).

                                                Fever of 102 and dehydration contributed to a syncope collapse early the morning after vaccination (7:15 AM  02/20/21). Just before collapsing, I experienced nausea, dizziness, confusion, weakness, and seeing all black in my field of vision. Emergency Room doctors say it was very likely related to an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Treatment included Tylenol and Ibuprofen, rest, and fluids.

Took ibuprofen in the middle of the first night and it helped a little. Fatigue and some reasonable arm pain and neck stiffness continued for a while. Migraine has continued since the vaccination; it&#39;s been 5 days. I&#39;ve had to take at least 2 Advil every day to help it. Can&#39;t even complete an aerobic workout even with the Advil because my head is shaking so much. I&#39;ve had mild migraines before surrounding my period, but they always disappear when I sleep and aren&#39;t there first thing in the morning like this has been. I feel so bad, I find myself having to keep stop walking during the day when completing a task just to hold my pounding head.  Not sure what to do.

                                                On Monday at around 2pm I started having severe pain in my chest near my right breast, and as the day progressed it got worse with a horrible migraine. It began to radiate to the left, and Wednesday I went to Urgent Care because I was scared. My EKG &amp; chest x-ray were clear. Today I feel even worse with migraines, chest pain (that radiates up my neck and around my back), and overall feeling gross and exhausted. My head is what?s bothering me the most along with my joint pain.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

Over the next several days she had migraines, fever, nausea, diarrhea.  She had a very heavy period that was not normal for her.  She was treated twice for presumed UTI (once with macrobid and then with cefuroxime) in the days after the vaccine though cultures ended up negative.  She was referred to me, a hematologist, when she was noted to have a dropping hemoglobin and platelet count.  She appears to have a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and possibly ITP.  She is feeling a little better but her labs remain abnormal.  Please note this was reported on Pfizer website as well but I have not been contacted.  Guidance would be sincerely appreciated.  My cell phone was provided.

Was with her mom, in case she had an issue. Vaccination without incident.  Kept pt at the vaccination area to observe.  About three minutes after receiving the vaccination, pt started to shake.  Was conversing.  Stated she was warm, so got her a cold bottle of water.  Stated she was dizzy so helped her to the floor to lay down.  She had contractions of her hands, which she stated that they were numb.  She recovered from the dizziness, but then had a panic attack.  Her BP was normal, but her heart rate became elevated.  Had her lay down until she felt better, helping to slow her breathing.  After about 40 minutes,p t felt good enough to sit in the recovery area.  Ensured she had water and some food to help prevent a blood sugar drop.

After that - upper respiratory  symptoms- cough, nasal congestion, sore throat - Tuesday - Saturday after the vaccine. I had a very sore arm - couldn&#39;t lift my arm up for about four days. Advil - cold and flu for symptoms. It helped manage the symptoms.  I went on an antibiotic for the respiratory symptoms - I had contacted my doctor and they prescribed it.

So I was okay after the 30 minutes but when I started driving I felt like I was high on strong drugs. Like as if I?d taken an extremely strong marajuana edible and it just hit me. I had to pull over because my eyes wouldn?t stay open, my whole body was feeling very heavy and I was extremely tired and out of it. I didn?t have another way to get home (I had traveled about an hour) so I just kept driving and taking 15 min rests along the way. When I got home I fell asleep as soon as I sat down and slept for about four hours. I feel better now that I?m awake, still light headed but not near as bad.

Later that night I felt sick to my stomach and experienced diarrhea. The next day I was nauseous and began vomiting for two days with continuous chills, hot flashes, diarrhea and headaches. The following day I stopped vomiting but continued to have chills, hot flashes and diarrhea. A week after the injection, I am finally feeling some relief.

                                                I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 9:15 AM on March 9, 2021.  I then returned to work. At about 4:30 PM on that same day, I started feeling dizzy. I felt like I was going to faint at work. Every time I would stand up, I would feel like I was going to pass out.  I had someone drive me home because I felt that I was too dizzy to drive. I arrived home at 6:00 PM and began to vomit profusely. I threw up all night and had the chills.  In the morning, I felt better but still had a dizzy feeling. The dizziness and vomiting completely  subsided by March 11,  2021.    On March  12, 2021, I noticed that I had floating black spots in my left eye accompanied by a painful migraine. I have never had eye floaters or migraines previous to this vaccine. My migraine lasted for 5 days straight and I had to be off work to go to the emergency  room because I started to loose vision in my left eye. They were unsure of the cause because I did not have any pre-existing health conditions.  The migraine finally subsided after the 7th day. I have had eye floaters every since I got the vaccine. I?ve been to an eye doctor and my primary and they all have told me that it could be from this vaccine because I have never had the problem until I received it.

                                                Although I did experience extreme headaches and a sore arm within days of getting the vaccine in addition to continuing &amp; excessive fatigue, a little over a week later I had an extreme, painful skin outbreak all over my body. I&#39;m assuming my eczema flared up in reaction to the vaccine, but up until that day my eczema had been dormant and restricted to a mild dry patch on my arm and leg joints. Within an hour, I had red spots and red patches appear all over body, including my stomach and back, where I hadn&#39;t had an eczema outbreak in years. My neck was swollen and became extremely wrinkly in appearance, as did my elbows and anywhere else I itched. Although that night was the most abrupt and extreme part of the reaction period, it took 3 days for the flare-up to calm down, the duration of which I was incredibly itchy and experiencing some pain. I took several Benadryl tablets the next day to help calm the itchiness before bedtime.

Felt very restless and sick during night, by the next morning symptoms really sat in.  March 24, 2021: Went to Urgent Care due to fever. Had COVID-19 test (negative). Very close to passing out there (put head between knees and did not). Was sent to emergency room immediately due to heart rate (high 140s-150s. Highest known was 152 BPM). ER performed following: portable chest x-ray, blood tests, urine tests, EKG. Was told results were all normal with the exception of EKG (not told anything about it, form listed as abnormal). Passed out 2x at hospital. Was given one IV rehydration solution and released that night. Symptoms below lasted for several days: Headache Aches Nausea Aggressive shakes Shortness of breath Confusion Dizziness Site pain (also developed bump under arm) Fever - 103.8 (after 2 Advil, 2 Tylenol, 3 ice packs and eating frozen grapes) Heavy sweats Racing heart Restless  March 30, 2021: Still having frequent heart palpitations (they come and go but happen several times during the day. Keep having very high heart rates). Went to doctor. While there, nurse noted irregular heartbeat that sounded like it was ?skipping a beat? and heart rate was also jumping all over the place (high pace, low pace, high, etc.). It was clear something was abnormal. Doctor gave EKG approximately 20 minutes later, EKG looked normal. Was told to come back next morning for blood work and to cut out caffeine.  March 31, 2021: Came in for blood work to check thyroid.  April 6, 2021: Thyroid results were normal. Still having palpitations among other symptoms (see April 12 for more info) so was told to come in. Was given ?work from home? note and referred to cardiologist.  April 12, 2021: Appointment at cardiologist. Still having severe palpitations, occasional dizziness/ lightheadedness, nausea, shortness of breath, exhaustion and chest pain. Heart rate was recorded this day to have gotten up to 139 BPM-- was very high majority of the day. EKG was normal (with exception of high heart rate) but 30 mins later doctor observed high heart rate and abnormal rhythm. Was told to come back in a week and one day for a heart ultrasound and heart monitoring for three days. Still no caffeine intake since 3/30/21. Previous heart rates taken at doctor&#39;s visits over the years for comparison below. Never had any prior heart problems whatsoever:  8/29/18: 70 BPM 9/17/18: 88 BPM 10/17/18: 64 BPM 10/31/18: 73 BPM 1/21/19: 78 BPM Note: At this point, I have missed over a  week and a half of work, and worked from home for over a week. I&#39;m not any better heart wise at all over the course of three weeks post vaccine.

I felt as though it was necessary to report because my doctors have no idea what is causing this, and nothing else could be affecting it. I have been bleeding for 2 weeks now (starting April 5), with clots around 5&#34;. I had a full CBC in January and found nothing abnormal that could explain this, including no history of extended bleeding (historical max of 7 days).

                                                Chills and hot flashes starting 5pm(estimated) April 12th and continuing until April 18th. No temperature measured except the 16th when temperature fluctuations measured between 94-98 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day (fluctuating fairly quickly with multiple degree differences within minutes of each other, thermometer was correct when compared with a second thermometer&#39;s readings)  Migraines all day Tuesday (13th of April) and Wednesday (14th of April) with severe nausea worsening at night, stayed laying or sitting down to keep from throwing up. Period (menstruation) started this day as well, and bleeding was heavier than normal with severe cramps which I never experience. Migraines are also never experienced as a symptom of menstruation. Migraines continued until Monday April 19th but were much lighter and without nausea or stomach cramping. Period ends today (April 21rst), the blood having been heavy the entire time.   Outcome: I am still getting headaches but nothing as severe as before and am able to go about normal life again.   Treatment: Did not see any professionals for symptoms. Took Ibuprofen for pain on Saturday and Sunday (and avoided pain killers at all before that for fear of that possibly being dangerous and complicating things if my condition had worsened and I needed to seek medical care). Saturday and Sunday I only took 1 dose each day. I did take coffee to try to help with the migraines Saturday and Sunday as well and that with the Ibuprofen helped a little bit.

I woke up again around 5:15 am to intense involuntary shaking. My family members wrapped me in blankets and applied pressure to my body until the shaking stopped. Within the next 40 minutes I vomited and had diarrhea. At the time also had body aches, chills, fever, and mild swelling of various areas if the body. I slept most of the morning and ate lunch around 1:30 pm. I took Tylenol again at 2:00 pm with the symptoms lessening over the next 5-6 hours. After that fever, chills, and body aches returned.

When I woke up the next morning, I had continual arm pain, severe chills, nausea, exhaustion, and a headache. These symptoms were reduced with 800mg of acetaminophen every 4-6 hours. The symptoms started to get better at around 9:00pm. The following morning, all symptoms were gone except for a very mild discomfort in my shoulder where the shot was.

                                                About five to ten minutes after I received my first shot, I started to feel like my throat was closing a little. I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

                                                At 10:30 both of my legs and arms were tingling. Legs were worse than arms. In the morning, the feeling was still there and it worried me so I went to  Urgent Care, but they just told me to monitor my symptoms and make sure that I don&#39;t start to feel weak. It persisted through the day. The next morning I woke up and it was mostly just on my right side in the leg, feet, hands and arms. Around 9:00 AM the right side of my face began to go tingling-- felt like I had Novacane injection. No pain. Because of my anxiety, throughout the day I got nauseous and warm, but never had a fever or anything like that. Been drinking lots of fluids.

                                                Around 3:30am on Sunday, I woke up due to feeling very cold. My teeth were chattering and regardless of the amount of layers of clothes or blankets added, I could not get warm. Later in the day I checked my temperature and it registered at 100.6 degree Fahrenheit, but I did not feel as cold as I had earlier that morning. I also had what felt like a sinus headache and my whole body felt stiff/achy. There was also some slight nausea that occurred. The nausea and slight fever went away by 11am, but the headache and body aches lasted until about 9PM Sunday night. After my nausea went away I was able to take some Aleve to help with the stiffness.  At the site of injection, it is slightly raised red bump (about two inches across horizontally and vertically), and there is some slight pain  in the armpit area on this side as well. The swelling of the bump was slightly bigger yesterday, but the swelling has gone down some this morning.

A 22-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 15Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient received the immunization in a hospital. Medical history included Ehlers-Danlos, allergic asthma, and fracture. Concomitant medication included drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (NIKKI) for birth control. There were no other vaccines given in four weeks. The patient previously took tramadol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and experienced allergies. On 28Jan2021 at 11:00, the patient experienced right sided numbness, severe headache, and nausea, which were serious for disability. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The patient was treated in the emergency room and sent home with TIA protocol to follow with neurologist. There was no COVID prior or post vaccination. The clinical outcome of the events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available the causal association between the reported events right sided numbness, severe headache, and nausea and the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded but also the contributory role of the concomitant medications/medical history of the patient need to be taken into consideration. The case will be reassessed should the additional information be available.

Patient received the vaccine while sitting in the zero gravity chair, due to a history of feeling lightheaded and passing out with needles. After a few minutes in the zero gravity chair, patient expressed that she was feeling good and wanted to sit in the observation area next to her boyfriend. She got up and walked to another chair without assistance and with a steady gait.  EMT made contact with the patient at 3:12 PM, while she was sitting in the observation area. Patient was conscious, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation but complained of &#34;lightheadedness.&#34; EMT grabbed a wheelchair and patient was then transferred to wheelchair, without assistance. At 3:15 PM, baseline vital signs were taken, while patient was sitting: blood pressure: 136/82, heart rate: 108, respiratory rate: 18. Skin was cold, dry, and normal for ethnicity. Patient claimed to have anxiety and explained that fainting and lightheadedness was &#34;common&#34; for her after receiving a shot. Patient denied taking any medications or having any allergies. A second set of vital signs were taken at 3:20 PM: blood pressure: 136/86, heart rate: 108, respiratory rate: 18. Skin was moist, warm, and normal for ethnicity. Patient was negative for orthostatic pressures. EMT advised patient to stay an additional 30 minutes for further observation. Around 3:50 PM, patient was asked how she was feeling and she stated &#34;good.&#34; EMT educated the client on what to do if additional signs and symptoms developed and when to contact her provider. EMT also explained the use of V- safe to the patient. Patient then left the vaccination site, unassisted and with a steady gait.

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), second dose intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 11:30 (lot number: EN6205) as single dose (at the age of 22-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rhinitis allergic. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen; cefuroxime; clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]); ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE); spironolactone; acetaminophen; origanum minutiflorum oil (OREGANO OIL); tretinoin; ondansetron (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) and &#34;Olly probiotic/prebiotic&#34;; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history included having the COVID virus in Feb2021, her symptoms were mild, she lost her sense of taste and smell; patient started her period before the shots (HPV vaccine) they weren&#39;t regulated yet. Family history included cancer (patient&#39;s father). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included unspecified pill to help regulate periods. Patient previously received first dose of HPV vaccine vlp rl1 4v (yeast) (GARDASIL) in May2011 (Lot Number: 0087Y), second dose in Jul2011 (Lot Number: 0087Z), third dose in Nov2011 (Lot Number: 06918A), all for immunization at the age of 13 years. The mother reported that she believes her daughter had an adverse reaction to the HPV vaccine. Stated that the following year they were going on a family vacation in Jun2012.  She took the kids to get their annual blood work and her daughter&#39;s (patient) came back abnormal. Patient was retested and was told that she had Hashimoto&#39;s Thyroiditis in Jul2012. When patient went to high school she had a lot of problems with her menstrual cycle, her period stopped. They thought maybe it was because she was thin and played a lot of sports. Then patient was diagnosed with premature ovarian failure. Patient had started her period before the shots so they weren&#39;t regulated yet; but after the Gardasil vaccines it was worse.  Stated that patient does not produce estrogen and has to take a pill; also takes a pill to help regulate her periods.  No further information provided about these pills. The mother said they are worried she will have a hard time having children. Patient has periodic ultrasounds of her ovaries and has been told they look normal. The mother stated she did not want patient to get the COVID Vaccine after this experience, they believe was related to the HPV Vaccine.  Stated patient was very anxious about COVID-19; worried she would give it to her parents, especially her father who has cancer. Patient had the COVID virus in Feb2021, her symptoms were mild, she lost her sense of taste and smell. The mother consulted with their family doctor who said it didn&#39;t make a difference how long patient waited after the Covid Virus to get the Covid Vaccine.  Patient became eligible to receive the vaccine in Mar2021. Patient got the vaccine and about 9 days later, the mother thought she had hurt her right big toe.  It was stinging and burning and painful. The patient was seen at an urgent care and at  an institute. The doctor at the Institute said patient had aggravated the sesamoid bones in her right big toe and was diagnosed with sesamoiditis of right foot on an unspecified date in 2021. The patient was given a walking boot to wear. The events did not require a visit to emergency room (discrepancy noted), but they visited physician office due to pain in right big toe after first vaccine. Outcome of the events was not recovered.   No follow up attempts are needed. No further information expected.

A 22-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8731) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, premature ovarian failure and covid-19. Concomitant medications were not reported. After the second shot the patient received in Apr2021, she was sitting for the 15 minutes after the vaccine and her right foot was numb and tingling. Her left foot was fine. At home after the vaccine the patient had her feet propped up and her toes were purple.  They did not think about it being any type of side effect from the Covid Vaccine; they thought maybe her foot was wrapped too tightly. On Monday, 26Apr2021, her big toe on her left foot now has the same stinging, burning, pain that the right toe had in it when this all began. Her toes on both feet are still turning purple off and on.  The doctor says that since when they are pressed the purple goes away then comes back it is okay. Both feet were swollen at one time.  The swelling has decreased in the right foot; but continues in the left. It was believed that the patient was suffering from neuropathy. The patient was recovering from the event peripheral swelling. The outcome of the events was pain in extremity and skin coloring was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

My balance is off. I got my heart checked in which I had to wear a heart monitor and get an echo. It came back and nothing is wrong with my heart. I also cannot take a deep breath. I always have shortness of breath. I had three episodes in which I thought I was actually going to pass out and my arms and legs were tingly and I was nauseated. I went to the emergency room and nothing came back from my labs. I am lightheaded when I get up fast. I no longer have nausea and appendages tingle.  All of this occurred on the first dose and I did not receive the second dose.

This nurse reported similar events for 3 patients. This is the first of 3 reports.  A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away. She reported that this one is medically significant because even though she did not have shortness of breath, it could have affected her airway. She confirmed that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;had a tightness and lump in her throat&#39;, allergic reaction was not recovered (a s reported); while recovered on 27Dec2020 for allergic reaction like rash/red rash on her chest and rash was on her arms too and cheeks were flushed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events throat tightness, sensation of foreign body, allergy to vaccine, rash erythematous and flushing cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height.

                                                Three hours after I received the vaccine, I began to feel extremely tired and had a headache. Five hours after, the injection site had a pinkish color and felt sore. Then it was difficult to move my arm due to the soreness that traveled from my right upper arm to my right shoulder. I went to bed after taking Tylenol due to the headache and body aches. I woke up on 01/08/2021 with a severe migraine and general body aches. I took Tylenol in the morning and spent the day sleeping due to the migraines, malaise, and body ache. Throughout the day, I also experienced hot flashes and minimal nausea.

I had a fever of 103.0 at 3 am which proceeded to come down 45 minutes later and stay at 100.4 until 10 am. During that time I had a pounding headache, nausea, aches, chills and was profusely sweating and shaking with the fever.  Symptoms abruptly ended at noon on 1/11/21. This also occurred with the first dose that I recieved 12/23/20 at 5:30 however the fever and s/s were not quite as bad. This time they were definitely worse and prevented me from doing anything, I am glad I was not scheduled for work.

                                                After around 12 hours from getting my vaccine, I experienced strong aches, mild fever, and headaches. Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia. Symptoms became more mild at hour 31 post vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node after the first vaccine above my left collarbone (injected on left side) and still have this, and now I have a swollen armpit that is very painful on my right side (injected on the right side).

On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well.

By 10pm I felt extremely exhausted, continuing with body aches and chills. Around 12am I had a fever of 102.6 and extreme 10 out of 10 lower back pain. I have never felt more sick in my life. The back pain was so severe I thought I was having a kidney stone. I was ready to go to the hospital. The fever lasted until  about 4am when I took some ibuprofen. I felt tired and had mild body aches until 3pm the  following day.

I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

I took my temperature at 6:00 pm on 1/20 and it read 99.7. I then took tylenol and at 8:30, I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. My normal temperature is 97.2-97.5. I took an ice bath at this point as my arm at the injection site was extremely swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. I called urgent care to see what medications I could take in addition to tylenol and they recommended motrin to bring down my fever. I woke up several times through the night and took medication. At around 8 am on 1/21, I took my temperature and it was 97.8.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

However, on the 28th of January, I woke up with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on my left side of my neck. So, I have swelling and lumps/growths above my left collar bone. My left arm is numb and tingly and I feel very sick. I am nauseous and have body aches. I went to urgent care and they believe it is a reaction to the vaccine. I was tested for mono and strep throat and do not have either. I took a rapid covid test on Wednesday the 27th and it was negative.

                                                I received the COVID19 vaccine on January 22, 2021. I started to have chest tightness and somewhat of a dry cough midday on Monday January 25, which continued until January 27. I started having congestion and runny nose on January 27, so I went and got tested for COVID on the 27. The test came back positive on January 28. On January 28 I had extreme congestion and head pressure, a bad burning sensation from my left sinus that went back to my left 2nd molar, and a runny nose. I had not gone anywhere the week prior due to studying for an exam besides to lab at school twice where everyone was socially distanced and was wearing a mask the whole time. The highest my temperature got was 99.4 with Tylenol on January 28. In addition to this, my husband got covid tested on January 28 to see if he had it, or had given covid to me and his test came back negative. We had not socially distanced and still had physical contact the entire time, and continued not to do so in our house. We have had full contact the entire time because he is working from home and most of my school is online, and he got tested again on January 30 and came back negative again. If somehow I got covid from school in a short amount of time with everyone wearing a mask, how would he not get covid from me after a full week of exposure unless I was not contagious, which makes me think I somehow got it from the vaccine. I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, as I got the shingles when I was 4 as a direct result from the first chickenpox vaccine.

The welt was outlined and observed and the patient was given 25mg of Benadryl. After about 20 minutes the swelling and tenderness had spread to an area approximately the diameter of a tennis ball. At this point she was refered to see a doctor at the Health Center. The nurse called to follow-up once the patient arrived as she had not seen this type of reaction after the vaccine. After discussion the physician was going to look at her. Reportedly the swelling had begun to retract and the patient apparently returned to work later that day, talking about her plans to receive the second dose.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

At ER  they did an EKG (normal result), then received  ibuprofen (21:30), acetaminophen (22:45), meclizine (22:45). Was discharged at 23:03.

After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

Outcome of event seizure was not recovered; outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient had underlying epilepsy.

                                                The first day I got my vaccine, I felt  fine, but my arm with the injection sight was very sore and body slightly achy. The second day I woke up and my arm was sore, but other than that I felt normal. Around 4pm on the second day, my back started to hurt where the break break in my spine is. It was just a normal amount of pain at first, but within an hour there was throbbing pain in my lower back, spreading into my legs. This is where I normally feel my chronic pain, but I had a spinal injection a little over 6 months ago and doesn&#39;t usually stop working until about a year. It is the normal pain I experience in the normal places, but the pain is worse and out of no where. That is not usually how the pain comes on when the spinal block wears off. It is much more gradual. It could be a coincidence, but the pain is not the way I have ever experienced the pain.  My back hurts too much to do things I need to do to function, which only happens to me when I have done something with a lot of physical activity that puts tension on my back like jumping, dancing, roller coasters. Before I started experiencing this pain, it was just a normal day for me where I didn&#39;t exert my back any more than normal, which is very little.

                                                I got my vaccine on 3/19 at 10am. My 6:30 pm on 3/19 my face got dark red, almost purple and started to swell. I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

                                                The second the person gave me the shot my index finger went numb, stiff and my range of motion decreased.  Within less than 24 hours day my whole hand and lower arm were stiff, numb,  painful, and tingling. I also have overall weakness and doing basic tasks like writing essays for school has become painful and difficult. My hand is stiff and looks like a claw. While it has gotten a little better after taking medications that my doctor prescribed my fingers are still weak stiff, numb, tingling, and painful.  The vaccine was administered too far up and too far to the left which has most likely caused nerve damage.  There is also a small bruise at the injection site and the injection is still visible 5&#43; days later. This could have been prevented through better training of health officials working at state-run vaccine sites. I hope this hasn&#39;t caused lasting damage.

When I arrived patient was laying down on a chair with a friend, shaking with seizure like activity but alert and oriented to person place and time. Upon my arrival she was shaking, vomited x 1 and then complained about chest pain.   Vitals upon my arrival: HR 58, o2 100% RR appeared to be around 22-24 (hyperventilating) BP 88 systolic (manual)--repeated by medics upon arrival minutes later 110/72.   Given throat closing sensation, vomiting, shortness of breath I advised to call 911 and ordered Epinephrine x 1 which was given by RN immediately. Pt was then placed on the grown chin up, she continued to shake throughout entire body but continued to be alert and oriented. Medics then arrived on seen, started an IV, glucose by medics 84, IVF started by medics. Pt was transported to ER via medics.   Pt is not a patient, last visit 2017. Pt did state she has hx of POTS and DRESS syndrome to Lamictal. Reports taking cetirizine this AM, Zofran and Oxycodone and Baclofen (prescribed by external PCP?).   Prior to transport to ER pt continued to be alert oriented, but shaking and twitching throughout her body. MD verbally communicated to patient to not receive the 2nd dose given her severe anaphylaxis like reaction to the first dose of the vaccine. Pt can be referred to allergist after ER follow up by PCP.  Denied pregnancy.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 12Feb2021 10:45 (at age of 23-year-old)(Lot Number: EN6205) as single dose, and received the second dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Mar2021 11:15 (at age of 23-year-old) (Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Genearal anxiety disorder, had this for a while and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had for 4-5 years. There was no allergies to medications, food, or other products.Concomitant medication(s) included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) taken for generalised anxiety disorder from an unspecified start date and ongoing; spironolactone (SPIRONOLACTONE A L) taken for acne (She has an Intra Uterine Device and it was causing some acne) from Sep2020 and ongoing; lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE) taken for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from an unspecified start date and ongoing.  The patient experienced positive COVID-19 test with symptoms on 22Mar2021. The event was considered as serious with serious criteria medically significant. The patient also experienced a sore arm on an unspecified date.  The patient did not have any adverse side effects (other than a sore arm) postvaccination of her first and second doses. The patient did not travel or really even leave her house two-weeks postvaccine to ensure built up the proper immunity/antibodies. However, around three weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the patient tested positive for Covid-19 and am symptomatic. The patient was congested and experiencing horrible headaches, lost her sense of smell and taste, and am extremely tired/fatigued. She received the first Covid 19 vaccine on 12Feb2021, injection in the left upper arm. She started out feeling really congested like she was getting a cold on Saturday night, 20Mar2021. She didn&#39;t think much of it and then she started to lose her sense of taste and smell on Monday, 22Mar2021. She had coffee and she couldn&#39;t taste it. She got an appointment to get a Covid 19 test. The cold like symptoms have been subsiding. Now she is really fatigued. She has brain fog,  and felt like she can&#39;t work as efficiently or concentrate. Her Covid 19 rapid test was positive on Monday, 22Mar2021. She had the Covid 19 PCR test on Monday, 22Mar2021 but she does not have the results of that test yet. She also has a headache. She didn&#39;t think she had Covid 19 until she couldn&#39;t smell or taste anything. She is still a little congested. She is taking Mucinex because of the head pressure. Today (24Mar2021) she woke up and it&#39;s been her best day. She can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s getting her smell back, but she compares it to having the flu, she can smell just a sick smell. She can&#39;t describe it any other way, just that she can smell and taste a sick smell. The headache she describes as dull. She thought its related to the congestion. She&#39;s been taking Mucinex a dual day and night, 2 capsules. Mucinex Sinus Max Day is Acetaminophen 325mg, Dextromethorphan HBr 10mg, Guaifenesin 200mg, and Phenylephrine HCl 5mg. Mucinex Sinus Max Night is Acetaminophen 325mg, Dextromethorphan HBr 10mg, Doxylamine Succinate 6.25mg, and Phenylephrine HCl 5mg. She started taking Mucinex on Sunday night, 21Mar2021, the nighttime one, then she took a daytime dose on Monday, 22Mar2021 in the morning. She took 2 doses on Monday, she thought she can take up to 3 doses per day. Then she took the nighttime dose again on Monday night,22Mar2021. She took 2 doses on Tuesday, 23Mar2021 and she took nothing last night because her congestion is getting better. She did take regular Tylenol this morning for her headache. Tylenol 500mg 2 capsules. When asking the caller questions from the Vaccine Supplemental Form regarding lack of efficacy, she reports she was possibly in contact with someone who was infected with Covid 19 as she traveled for her spring break from Thursday, 18Mar2021 to Sunday, 21Mar2021. This is discrepant from what was previously recorded at the beginning of the conversation when the caller reported she&#39;s not sure how she got the Covid 19 virus, she really didn&#39;t go anywhere. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: positive on 22Mar2021, SARS-COV-2 TEST: positive on 24Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of positive covid-19 test with symptoms and a sore arm. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was resolving.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

                                                Immediately after injection, started getting black spots in vision. I was able to drive through the cones to the waiting area but the black spots were getting worse to the point where I could barely see. My ears also felt numb and I could barely hear anything. I got to the waiting area (drive-thru clinic) and they weren&#39;t making people wait the 15 min so I told them I could barely see and couldn&#39;t drive. I was attended to by medical personnel. My vision was almost completely full of black spots, slurry speech, I felt very sweaty and very weak. As I was being attended to, the only thing that helped was reclining my seat and closing my eyes with the A/C on. After about 20 min my vision was improving and my friend picked me up from the site. I proceeded to lay down and drink lots of gatorade and felt more normal in a few hours to the point of being able to drive home. I continued to feel weak and fatigued for the rest of the day. The next day I had very bad arm pain, but it seemed normal compared to other vaccines I&#39;ve received. The third day (today) I have a massive headache all day that is not improving from tylenol and seems very different than the average dehydration headache. Not sure if that&#39;s related to the vaccine but seems possible.

I  got patient ice pack and some chocolate(she said she wasn&#39;t diabetic or allergic to chocolate), got 2 pillows from the back of the store to lay her down but she wanted to sit in the big chair with arm rests on it;  mom got her a water, after 15 more minutes patient felt much better &amp; asked to leave. We verified that she felt fine &amp; she did not want a wheelchair. Mom did mention that patient does regularly pass out in stores(without  giving blood or getting shots). I recommended that she see a doctor about that issue because their could  be something more serious going on with her body.

It felt like things were moving in slow motion, frame by frame, when I woke up at 3am. Was light headed, couldn&#39;t stand, chills and shaking. I vomited from 3-4 am and then again at 8am when I woke up, with my visual disturbances limited to the 3-4am hours. I took Advil and was able to go back to sleep for most of the day, sleeping from around 9am to 1pm. Nausea, fever, and vomiting have all have cleared. Now I just have a headache and muscle aches, especially near the injection site. Almost 24 hrs after my vaccine now and I feel drastically better than I did overnight.

The next morning (4/23/21), the injection site appeared to be infected. When the scab was removed, the injection site oozed pus and blood. Arm pain waned after the site was cleaned but remains sore and the injection site remains raised.

A 23-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 21Apr2021 08:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 23 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen. The patient previously took septra and experienced allergies (known allergies); and first dose of BNT162B2 on 31Mar2021 08:45 at right arm for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine in four weeks. On 22Apr2021, the patient had a fever of up to 103.5 and was down to around 102 by the time of the incident (around 4:00). The patient woke up and was standing for about 3 minutes to refill water when she got super nauseous. She was making her way to the bathroom to throw up, and the next thing she knew she was on the floor. The patient was not sure how long she was passed out for though she had no reason to believe it was long. She tried to sit up, but she really wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she laid back down and closed her eyes for a bit. Then she got super hot and sweaty. Once that passed (maybe a few more minutes), she was able to check her temperature and she was down to around 101 and was able to get back to bed. No treatment for the events. No COVID prior vaccination. The patient had not been COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in Apr2021.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                Anxiety/mental related; Lightheaded; Sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 23-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP 6955), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 16Mar2021 at 02:30 PM (at the age of 23 years), as a single first dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was allergic to Penicillin, Sulfa drugs, Cefalexin, walnuts and pecans. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included Zoloft (Sertraline) and Estarylla (Ethinyl Estradiol and Norgestimate). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. On 16Mar2021 at 02:45 PM (directly following the vaccination), the patient experienced light headedness, and she thought it was mostly anxiety/mental related and not vaccine related as she was nervous; fully recovered after 10 minutes or deep breaths and drinking Gatorade. Four hours later, she experienced sore arm. Therapeutic measures taken for the adverse events was unknown. The clinical outcome of events lightheaded, anxiety/mental related, nervous were fully recovered, and sore arm was not recovered at the time of reporting. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Symptoms in leg started a few days prior to admittance. Was put on Heparin via shot and then IV. Clotting grew worse overnight with leg swelling, leading to an inability to walk. After increased elevation leg improved and was put on an oral dose of Eliquis. Was put on oxygen in the ICU and took portable oxygen home when discharged on 5/17.   Also tested positive for strep 4/11.  Was advised to file a report by my PCP.

                                                Pt had a scheduled appt at 1235 pm for her 2nd dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 6/4/21 at our store .  Pt stated that she had some &#34;chest tightness&#34; shortly after the first dose (~4/24/21). After reviewing VAR filled out by patient today, I consulted with pt about having a reaction to the first dose.  Pt stated that EMS observed her for 30 minutes after the 1st vaccination and patient self-reports that she recovered without the use of an epi pen (pt does carry an epipen on her at all times) within that 30 minute window and was allowed to leave.  We administered 2nd dose with the understanding that patient recovered from 1st dose with no breathing difficulties or swelling of tongue or throat (just chest tightness as reported by pt).   After administering the second dose today, Pt began to show signs of an allergic reaction ~ 5 minutes after administration  and we administered the epi-pen and  911 was called.  Observed that pt vomited and complained of chest tightness, tight throat , difficulty breathing and being hot and &#34;sleepy&#34; after second shot.  Pt appeared to be alert and oriented and was sitting in a chair.  EMS arrived and pt is now under their care.  We dont know the lot number of the 1st covid vaccination but the lot used today was EW0167 with an expiration of 8/31/21.

                                                Around 12 am after the dose of my vaccine, I got a fever, chills, body aches, headache and fatigue. I knew all of these things to be normal. My arm was sore and I also knew that was expected. I could hardly move out of bed. At 0700 this morning, on 6/4, I finally got the energy to shower. That is when I noticed my lymph node in my armpit of the same arm I received my vaccine in was swollen to about the size of a tennis ball. I had a PA that I work with recommend me to go to an urgent care to be seen because she did not believe this to be normal. I received a Toradol injection and a course of antibiotics to take in case it turned out to be infected.

The night of getting the first shot I barely slept because I had chills all night long &amp; my entire body was so sore it hurt to lay in any position. In the morning, I still had extreme muscle pain all over. I was extremely light headed &amp; dizzy, I had a throbbing headache so I  took 2 aleve pills. I was getting super nauseous and almost passed out while trying to get to my bathroom just in time to throw up only water. Just before throwing up my vision went fuzzy,  my ears were ringing, I was dripping sweat, it was getting hard to breathe, &amp; my hands were shaking.  After taking a cold shower, laying down, &amp; drinking some water I feel a bit better but not 100% normal.

                                                Patient ,, was vaccinated at approximately 2:15pm today at  Vaccine Clinic. While in the observation area post-vaccine, patient lost consciousness at approximately 2:20pm for 60-90 seconds. Patient was not nervous, did not feel dizzy, nauseous, or feel she had an allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient is an employee of  Environmental and was accompanied by a co-worker.  PA  evaluated the patient, initial pulse rate was 104, a few minutes later was 87, then rose again to 97.BP was 125/78. Patient reported feeling weak and cold, has not eaten or had anything to drink today except a cup of coffee and cookies in the morning. PA assessed the patient vasovagaled due to dehydration, not due to a reaction from the vaccine. Patient drank 3 small bottles of water, ate saltine crackers and a granola bar.   EMS was called and we attempted to cancel as the nurse was going to take the patient to  ED, but EMS arrived on site already, assessed the patient and the patient refused to go to the ED by nurse or EMS.  Patient was observed until 3:12pm and went home in an Uber.   Patient info:   Appointment #D11KA5Q

                                                4/30 - Five minutes after the vaccine, I passed out. I felt uncontrollably shaky and my vision went white. I was not anxious prior to getting the vaccine and felt terror afterwards. 5/1 - I developed severe depression and suicidal ideation. I reported to those around me that I did not feel safe. I am not diagnosed with depression and did not experience depression prior to the vaccine. I felt suicidal, completely hopeless, anxious, and was uncontrollably bursting into tears without an identifiable trigger. 5/2 - I developed shooting pain in my legs and arms. It felt like a pulsating, stabbing pain that throbbed. It was unlike any pain I had experienced ever before. 5/3 - I developed a metallic taste in my mouth that could not be washed away with water or food. It was extremely noticeable. 5/4  - My period came a week early. I have been on birth control for seven years and have never experienced any changes in my menstrual cycle. I made no other lifestyle or health changes other than the vaccine. The period was extremely heavy, full of clots, and was painful. It lasted longer than usual, until about 5/9. 5/16 - I developed another period only a week after the first period. This period was equally as heavy and long-lasting. It remained until about 5/21.  Following the vaccine, I began suffering from heart palpitations, leg cramps, and random pains. I did not experience these prior to the vaccine. I cannot identify the date these symptoms began, but it was within the first week of taking the vaccine.

Called 911 transported to ER. Monitored cardiac unit for 24 hours, HA. Two months of HAs. I went home and I don&#39;t recall exact how everything transpired.  I do remember they wanted follow up with PCP.  I developed blood clots in R arm, platelets were high since getting vaccinated.  *originally diagnosed with colitis but now diagnosed with Chrohns disease.  1/16 I did have a personal injury in a parking lot that exacerbated the issues, I was vaccinated after.  *In transition with new doctors now and have not really discussed the potential of this being caused by vaccine, focused more on pain management.  **before this vaccine, I was relatively healthy before, no issues.

Symptoms began roughly 3.5 hours after second dose and are still continuing in waves nearly 8 hours later. I have had my menstrual cycle for nearly 15 years and have never experienced anything like this. Recently I had a well-women?s check-up/PAP and results were normal, so no reason to suspect any health issues that may suddenly cause this. I have tried applying heat, taking a magnesium supplement, and massaging my stomach to no avail.

Numbness, which after about 10 hrs turned into extreme tingling sensation in feet, legs, hands, arms, face and neck. Tingling sensation is still present to this day 2 months after first vaccination however it comes and goes, especially present under periods of stress which never happened before until I received the vaccine. I haven?t not received the second dose because I?m too scared I will completely lose feeling in my body and it will never returner I will develop Guillian-Barre syndrome as a result.

No weakness, just numnbess &amp; altered sensation in the right arm.  Over the next 8 hours I felt the numbness spread to the entire right side of my body, down my leg, up my back, my abdomen, neck, and side of my face.  In the morning I went to the emergnecy department to be evaluated per the reccomendation of employee heath and my PCP.  The checked my labs and they were normal, I recived 1L NS bolus.  I then followed up with my PCP after.

I do have little bit pain on it; Vaccine administrator put the vaccine in the wrong part of the arm; She put further behind her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 24-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acne. Concomitant medication included spironolactone for acne. The patient was reporting an adverse reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She had two concerns. One concern was that she found that the vaccine administrator put the vaccine in the wrong part of the arm, she said, she put further behind her arm, these were her words and she complains that her right leg hurts when she sits down. She said, she works 12 Hours a day and the pain starts shooting down from her arm to her leg, the injection site is red and swollen and she was not taking any medication to alleviate the symptoms. On 31Dec2020, it was reported that the patient was little bit concerned the area, she stated, &#34;I know it is supposed to be swollen for few days but today it is still swollen, its red. I do have little bit pain on it but I was a little bit concerned because I was told by my coworkers and nurses. I am not sure they put it in the right area so I guess the nurse administered the vaccine, she put it like instead of like where they normally put the vaccine, she put it at the side of my arm like, not like behind my arm like normally, I was a little bit of concerned. Another symptom that I have been feeling that whenever I sit down my left leg hurts so much like I have been on my feet like, I am working for 12 hours straight away so I have been working on my feet for pretty much the entire day so every time I sat down only my side hurts, on the side where I take the vaccine, I don&#39;t know if there is everything to do with that, it is like tolerable pain but (sentence incomplete).&#34; No treatment for the events. The outcome of the events injection site is red and swollen was not recovered and unknown for the other events.  Information on batch number has been requested.

                                                I got the second dose to the Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/2021at 11 AM. I felt throughout the day and was able to finish my shift. Later that night, I had very strong rigors, chills, severe headache and felt feverish. I took some Tyenol and felt a little better. I woke up at 5 AM to go to work, and my body was so fatigued and tired I couldn&#39;t move. My hands were shaking badly, and my whole body hurt. My joints hurt, my muscles, ect. I called out of work, as I work in the Micro lab doing COVID-19 PCR testing, I couldn&#39;t pipet correctly if I was shaking. I do not have any pre-existing conditions, and I have no allergies. I have never experienced an adverse reaction to a vaccine.

The chest tightness continued until 1/23.  It was not a constant pain, but sometimes when I would move a certain way, my chest would hurt. The spot that hurt is right in the middle of my chest. It got worse when I would exercise and breathe heavily. The chest pain continued to stop and come back for several weeks. The night after I received the vaccine, I felt dizzy and felt as if I would pass out, but did not. This only happened one time and was better when I woke up the next morning.   The weekend after I got the vaccine, I was worried I might have covid, so I got tested for covid, but the results came back negative.

Next morning 1/28 very sore leg muscles, hot flashes, headache. As day went on my limbs were tingling and had some numbness.  Increasingly getting fatigue and wasn&#39;t able to keep my head up for more than 30sec with out it falling. By 5p I could not move left arm at all and called PCP office and went to ER. Over 5 hours I got  feeling back in left arm and left ER at 10:30p. CT was done to rule out stroke or other injury. Next day around 2p my right arm started to get more numb and I wasn&#39;t able to move it much. SOB and throat tightening came back briefly. Later that day lumbar puncture done to rule out guillain barre syndrome. Numbness is not as severe now 2/3 and each day since 1/28 it gets increasingly less

                                                I had nerve pain 8 on pain scale on 1/7, mostly centered on my back along my spine but when it was at its worst it was anywhere my skin was in contact with anything. First started feeling like my back itched at around 6:30pm. At 8:30pm, I started feeling exhausted and feverish. I took my temperature, it was 100.6 F, I took acetaminophen (2, 650mg tablets).  My symptoms did not get better and I started having chills and pain like needles stabbing me anywhere my clothes were touching me. I went to bed at around 11pm and tried to sleep unsuccessfully until 3am, tossing and turning in pain anywhere my skin was being touched, before trying ibuprofen (600mg, the dose I take for my migraines) which seemed to help and I finally fell asleep.  Next morning woke up feverish, exhausted, and in pain again. Once again ibuprofen helped and I continued taking it every 8 hours for the next day until my symptoms were no longer coming back when the dose was wearing off. Last ibuprofen was probably 10pm on 1/8.

I went to bed around 9 pm and had some chills and mild body aches so I took some Tylenol. I woke up around 12pm with sore muscles and cramps/aches in my back, hips, legs, and neck. I also had a mild fever of 100.7 and was nauseous. I took some Zofran for nausea. I had chills and was flushed and sweating. That next day I felt like I had been hit by a truck, I was very fatigued, had little to no appetite, and had a pounding headache. I slept the entire day 1/25. The following day 1/26 I felt better but still groggy, I slept the majority of the day before heading off to work.

She drank some water.  911 was not called because her mother was a nurse and was nearby.  She came and picked her up and took her to a doctor.  I checked on the patient this afternoon and she is feeling fine other than feeling tired.  She has a medical history of weight loss surgery and not dieting properly.  The administrator of the home  said she has a history of not feeling well and almost fainting from not eating properly after her weight loss surgery.

                                                Diarrhea and Cramping : I felt fine on Friday I was doing well. My arm was sore but over the course of Saturday it started to go away. The one thing that I have been clocking is diarrhea. I would have a cramping cramping feeling in my stomach on my left side it would feel like it?s coming from my uterus. I had first thought it was because I was in a sitting position and the 90° angle wasn?t great for my body and so I thought I just had to leave straight because even as I?m talking this right now like I feel a little bit of cramping sitting in a 90° angle. But the diarrhea is still ongoing it?s been waking me up at five almost 6 AM and I woken up at least three times in the middle of the night going into Sunday. I was actually fine during the whole entire day of Saturday because I was able to like be on a long meeting call but after that was done my body just needed to expel things. I did eat a tiny bit while I was in a meeting I ate cake   chocolate, A bunch of sweets. Also after I?ve woken up right now at 6 AM I drink some water and the water felt like it was sitting in the top of my stomach and I have to slowly very very slowly go down not in my esophagus in my throat in my stomach like it bloated me and as I was walking around it slowly went away I am trying to drink a lot of water because I?m conscious that I?m having diarrhea.   Is the diarrhea an an allergic reaction? Is the diarrhea a reaction to an active ingredient in the vaccine? (polyethylene glycol)

I have had continuous tremors for a month now, my fingers have also started to either tingle or go numb for a short period of time.

My heart rate was consistently in the 110s-120s and my blood pressure was in the 100s/40s. My highest temperature was 103.5. My fiancé is a nurse who took care of me at home. I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen for the aches and fever. I slept the majority of each day and was unable to perform my activities of daily life or exercise. I lost my appetite for about 1 week. I had no sense of taste in Sunday, which slowly returned over the next week. I was concerned about the loss of taste so I scheduled a COVID-19 swab which came back negative on 1/11.

                                                I got my Pfizer first dose today and it was fine at first, but four hours later I was slammed with incredible arm and shoulder pain. I have a really high pain tolerance (tore my meniscus 3x with no surgery or pain meds, wasn&#39;t too bad) and I&#39;m 24F, not on any medications. I keep reading that sore arms are common, but this is a 6/7 on the pain scale. Putting on joggers was excruciating and I almost vomited. I can&#39;t even bring a glass to my mouth with that arm. Even laying as still as possible hurts. I cannot lift my arm past my pelvis and my shoulder is immobile. I feel nauseous when I move it.  I haven&#39;t seen this experience anywhere so I am puzzled... I&#39;m fully vaccinated w/ everything else and the closest to this was the tetanus shot, which hurt but not like - this - level of pain. I&#39;m getting a bit concerned that the person who did it (in a hundred car drive thru) missed the deltoid and shot it into my shoulder?? It&#39;s VERY high on my arm. I believe in this vax 100% but I can&#39;t believe the pain I&#39;m having and why it&#39;s not mentioned anywhere.  Like I am so so grateful for this vax and am in awe of the science -- and everyone should get it   -- but I just don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m in literal excruciating pain :( Moving it even slightly feel like I&#39;m ripping it from the bone.   It?s now been 20 hours and the pain is worse than ever, even breathing, sneezing or bending over causes searing pain.

                                                Anaphylaxis - Throat swelled almost completely closed, wheezing, lightheadedness (nearly passed out), throat/neck and injection site were very itchy and swollen, face/eyes swelled up, turned very pale all over, heart palpitations, etc. The next day - severe, horribly painful burning sensation all throughout my body.  Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

He left to get water. Another RPH saw pt. falling over in her chair. Patient&#39;s eye were open and tears were coming down but she could not speak. Her eyes began to close and she kept trying to pass out. We took pts mask off and fanned her and kept talking to her. After about 3 minutes, she was able to focus her eyes and could say her name. After about 3 more minutes, she was able to count to 10 backwards. Her dad returned. She drank water and was feeling much better after about 20 more minutes.

                                                About 20 hours after the injection, my right eye started twitching, and within 5 seconds, the bottom half of my face (from my cheekbones down) went numb, and my mouth drooped open on both sides. The muscles in my lips were not working, and I had a hard time speaking. I could force a smile if I tried really hard, but if I was relaxed, the corners of my mouth were low on my face, and my mouth hung open.  It lasted about 5 minutes and over a minute faded back to normal. I went to urgent care after speaking with a triage nurse.

I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

                                                After getting the shot, felt lightheaded, pulse raced, sweating, flushing of face. Since getting the shot I have developed allergies to everything including smells, sunlight, foods previously tolerated, heat, etc. I have now been diagnosed by a specialist with MCAS.

I had a fever from the night of 03/31/21 to 01/02/21 that was managed well with tylenol. I had hot flashes, chills, and joint pain during this time as well. Aside from my hair falling out, I feel completely fine now. As I said, the hair may be a coincidence as I have an unrelated autoimmune disease.

                                                The patient received the Pfizer vaccine, given by HCP. After the vaccine, the patient felt a little anxious with increased heart rate so she asked HCP for a bottle of water. HCP went to get the water and informed the pharmacist on duty. Both pharmacist and HCP came back to the patient. She got the bottle and was about to open the bottle, but closed her eyes  and started shaking like having a seizure and passed out. She came back right after passing out but didn&#39;t know what happened. She then started shaking again for a few seconds but didn&#39;t pass out. Everything happened so quickly when she remained sitting on the chair. We called 911 and paramedics came. She mentioned that the seizure happened to her before, maybe once or twice a year. When paramedics came, they checked her blood pressure and it was ok. We asked her and she wanted to come to the hospital to check out to make sure that she is ok.

                                                Received 2nd vaccine at 1:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. Woke up in the early hours of Monday not feeling great, didn&#39;t sleep well. Woke up at 8am for work with extreme chills, aches and pains. Tried to get up to get water, was so nauseous and lightheaded, I felt like I was going to pass out. Could barely stand up straight. Walked back to room and collapsed onto bed. Dry heaved into a trash can for a few minutes, feeling like I was about to throw up. Did not throw up. Took 2 Tylenol layed in bed, unable to move as I was extremely dizzy, nauseous and generally unwell. Fever of 99.?? (I forget). Fell asleep and woke up 2 hours later feeling better. Tylenol wore off around 5pm. Extreme chills and body aches came back. Fever of 100.4. Did not want to eat but had a few pieces of bread. Went to bed like normal that night. Felt almost back to normal the next day, still a little nausea with low energy but no fevers.

                                                4/4: Woke up Easter Sunday with the following symptoms: sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed. Normally I do not experience a bowel movement until late morning, after 10am. But for the past 2 weeks I have been woken up around 5:30am with a sudden urge. At the beginning of my illness it was diarrhea but now it has transitioned to slightly more solid feces. It is not really diarrhea anymore.

I administered 25mg of Benadryl orally. Patient denied symptoms or worsening signs. I had the patient wait 30 minutes. Afterwards, patient denied any other issues or symptoms. I received the phone number for the patient, however the number is from another country. I tried calling the patient with no answer. Will attempt to follow-up tomorrow.

                                                I started to develop Bell&#39;s palsy ~24hrs after receiving the vaccine (got the vaccine Saturday 1pm, noticed symptoms periodically through Sunday). I recognized the early symptoms from one previous episode of Bell&#39;s palsy ~7mo ago (knot next to/under nose with the feeling of tightness and slight loss of feeling). I took 800mg ibuprofen every 3 hours upon the advice of my aunt, a nurse practitioner, to hopefully stop it before it progressed to full palsy, but on Wednesday woke up with facial droop and numbness primarily focused around the nose and upper lip on the right side. I went to Urgent Care facility, and received Prednisone for the Bell&#39;s palsy and Valacyclovir to cover in case it was a viral infection that flared when my immune system dropped after receiving the vaccine. The facial numbness is getting better but is not yet resolved (Friday). I am in the process of scheduling a follow up with a neurologist.

The withdrawal bleeding began several days late (day 4 or 5 of the placebo week) and was extremely light, only lasting for one day. I took a pregnancy test which was negative. A week later, I began to experience breast soreness, lasting up through the next withdrawal bleeding cycle; I took a second pregnancy test just before the second placebo week. In the next placebo pill week, I experienced 5 days of heavy bleeding, the first two of which presented with severe cramping, which has not happened in many years.

She experienced Tightening, heating up, swelling of throat and chest within 10 minutes of vaccine administration, also reported as at 14:15.

She had been to the Emergency Room a few times and saw doctors there. Her throat closing stopped later that evening and had come back about 4 times. Since then, she was not sure if it was just the sensation of the throat closing because it is coupled with shortness of breath. She had the sensation of throat closing about 4 times. She was short of breath every day since receiving the vaccine and up to 4 times each day. Sometimes it was worse than others. She had it while on the call (19Apr2021) and rated it 4/10.

The following day, my arm hurt much worse and the rest of my body began to ache throughout the morning. I developed a fever at 99.5°. Took Advil which helped a lot. Advil started to wear off at about 1:30. At that time, I became nauseous and a little dizzy. I ended up going home early from work because of it. That night, I had such intense pain around my midsection I could barely move and deep breaths such as a yawn hurt way more.

A 24-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 24-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did have COVID prior vaccination and the patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced delirium at night of given dose in the morning. The patient was not feverish, but she was mumbling unintelligibly, shaking uncontrollably and not recognizing family members. The patient received ibuprofen and acetaminophen as the treatment for the events. the outcome of events, delirium, mumbling unintelligibly, shaking uncontrollably and not recognizing family members was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between event delirium and BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6201) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 09Feb2021 08:30 (24-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Pins and needles/numbness in left leg through foot began about 3 hours after 2nd dose (from 02Mar2021 12:00). Extreme muscle tightness in left calf. Ultrasound done on calf came back negative. Full brain/spinal cord scan done to detect demyelination of nerves - MRI came back normal. EMG done on left leg to check for peripheral nerve damage - EMG came back normal. Almost 8 weeks post 2nd dose and still experiencing muscle weakness/fatigue and muscle spasms, specifically in legs through feet. Hands and feet &#34;fall asleep&#34;/go numb very frequently, even when the extremities are not restricted in any way. No medication or other treatment given for symptoms. Extremely heavy and painful menstrual cycle this month (1 month after 2nd vaccine, Apr2021), which is extremely abnormal for patient. Events were assessed as serious with criteria of Disabling/Incapacitating. Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of muscle weakness/fatigue and muscle spasms was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

A 24-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05May2021 (Lot Number: EW0167) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included weird blood pressure (kind of have weird blood pressure, it goes up and down pretty frequently, no treatment), endometriosis, seizure. Concomitant medications included lamotrigine (LAMOTRIGINE) taken for seizure; quetiapine. The patient had an adverse reaction to the first of the two vaccine shot and wanted to know if she can get the second. She had pretty bad cold and flu symptoms and did have anaphylactic allergies, and swell up like her throat, neck and face swelled a little bit on 06May2021. It wasn&#39;t enough to go to the emergency room. She took Benadryl and kind of monitored but she thought her doctor would have called it like a pre-anaphylactic sort of reaction. The patient was having the reactions on yesterday (06May2021), still didn&#39;t feel good today (07May2021). She started to swell up she took Benadryl and Tylenol because she had slight fever it was 102 (06May2021). So, Tylenol 400 mg (took 2 pills), took 600 mg of Ibuprofen and the Benadryl 200 (200 but not entirely sure). She tried not to take medication unless have to, the moment she started throwing up she took the Benadryl only took that once, her arm was really killing her so she did take the Ibuprofen twice yesterday (06May2021) and twice Wednesday (05May2021). The fever came back yesterday (06May2021). Tylenol, probably the same twice on Wednesday, twice on Thursday, the patient hadn&#39;t had to take any today (07May2021). The outcome of events was not recovered.

                                                Epileptic Encephalopathy. Severe increase in seizures (number and intensity). Some of the worse ones she has ever had. Started within 3 hours of receiving her vaccine. For 4 days she had some other weird odd side effects besides  significant increase in seizures. Weird reactions and increase in seizures with movement of any kind (in wheelchair, in car, carrying her from chair to bed, etc). Never had this before. Looked odd in her face, glassy eyes for a few days, weird movements. Her doctor called it a cytokoline storm type reaction at first but then she never went back down to her baseline for her seizures as they kept getting worse and worse. Finally on March 24th we did a medication infusion via IV to try to break the cycle and then on April 1st we started her on another seizure medication. On April 28 we increased the new seizure medication trying to get her back down to her baseline. She has never gone back down to her baseline, she is still dealing with an increase in seizures. She has days where she is just seizing all day long off and on for no other reason. Her team of doctors and I are 110% (yes 110%) sure this is a reaction to the vaccine. They called off the second dose, considered J&amp;J vaccine but then with the risk of clots and her not 100% stable due to the first vaccine reaction we decided to hold off. This is horrible because for the last year I lived for the day to get her vaccinated to be protected from COVID and now she can&#39;t be. I am devastated and so afraid for her life because as you see in her dx she is very high risk for COVID death. We love to travel and just started cruising as she loves it and now we can&#39;t because she isn&#39;t vaccinated. She can&#39;t go back to her life the way she knew it before the pandemic because of the vaccine not being safe for her. :(

                                                I got the second dose of the vaccine on May 11th 2020. I am currently on my second week for completing the vaccine. When it all started I was just laying down on my couch watching Netflix with my laptop on my lap (this was Thursday night, May 20th). My leg fell asleep but I didn?t think anything of it because once I started walking around it went back fine. However, On May 21st, Friday morning I was having serious pain in my left thigh. I believed it was a muscle strain. I did a cold compress, warm bath and took Tylenol from Friday to Saturday. I thought it got better but however by May 23rd, Sunday night I was incapable of walking on my own and needed assistance just to go to the bathroom. On May 24th I went to Urgent Care and they stated that I may have a blood clot so I went to the ER. While at the ER they stated I had a massive blood clot that would need a procedure done to remove it and was later admitted into the hospital and scheduled for the procedure. The blood clot travels from my groin to my ankle on my left thigh. They stated the reason for my blood clot would of been because of my birth control. And it?s possible reaction to me also taking the Pfizer vaccine. I have been on birth control for over 5 years and have not had any problems until now. I also do not have any history or family history of blood clots. I did not hit my thigh or have done any exercises for this to occur.

                                                So at around 9pm the evening of my shot, I started feeling feverish so I went to the other room to get my temperature and while I was waiting for my temperature to be recorded, I started to feel lightheaded and I called out for help. I woke up on the floor, I woke up to my roommate and boyfriend standing over me. They were on the phone with 9-1-1. I was out for about a minute and unresponsive. According to them, my arm was flailing and seizure-ish. I went to the ER, I was taken by EMS services. They gave me fluids and ran bloodwork and monitored me. They sent me home, I did have another episode of what I think was an episode of memory loss/passed out. I just remembered waking up in a room alone. I was at the ER for about 4-5 hours. They gave me IV fluids and I don&#39;t remember what else, some sort of supplement. It was magnesium oxide they gave me. When I left the ER I was really exhausted, and feverish and gross and I was pretty sick for the remaining two days. I didn&#39;t sleep well that night, I had a fever the following day and into the second day upon returning home as well.

                                                Suspected bursitis with prolonged arm pain and weakness 2 weeks after first Pfizer dose. On the day of vaccination, I had a panic attack and nearly blacked out after vaccination, something that had never happened to me after a vaccination. Once the pain started a few hours after vaccination, it significantly increased. I experienced excruciating pain in my left arm like I had never felt after any other vaccination. Complete inability to move my arm without pain; the pain persisted even with zero movement whatsoever. Within the first 12 hours the pain spread to my entire left shoulder, and within 24 hours the pain spread to my neck, and general upper left quadrant of my body to the point where inhaling deeply would cause chest pain on my left side. This extreme pain persisted for about 3-4 days. After about the 5th day, my left arm still felt different and weaker than my right arm but little pain remained. After the 7th day, pain started back up whenever I tried to use my arm in any way. The days went on and the pain and arm weakness is not passing. It is minor pains, aches, and occasional throbbing compared to those first few days after vaccination but chronic pain nonetheless. My left arm continues to feel weak and I have a concentrated area of pain directly where the vaccination site was, it&#39;s as if I could still feel exactly where the needle went through my body. My arm feels okay pain-wise upon waking most days but I am unable to do anything as simple as chopping vegetables or washing dishes without feeling pain for the rest of the day. I am unable to even wear a backpack for more than 10 minutes without my left shoulder hurting and feeling fatigued.

                                                I got the vaccine some time in the night when i was taking a shower i noticed arm soreness. when i went to bed around 11pm from the top of my shoulder down to my finger tips it was swollen and had arm pain. I tried to go to bed and about 30 minutes later i went to get up to grab some advil. I checked in the mirror to see if there was redness and got light headed. Next thing i know i passed out. I woke up on the floor and a big pool of blood i dont know how long i was out for. I had a nose bleed and had a bruise on my head, I could leave the bath room because i was shaking so bad and couldnt use any force to get up. After 45 mins that i went to my room and called my mom who is a physican i sat on the floor for 3 or 4 hours until i could get the nose bleed to stop. I ended up then getting into bed and the shacking had stopped after 800 mg of advil. I checked my pupils for signs of cuncussion. the 1/25 i had my first appointment and we checked to see if i broke my nose. after that the next days they did see signs of concussion with sleeping 20 hours a day and blurry vision. I went back to  med center to get an mri and eeg to see about the concussion because they were worried since i didnt know how long i was out for. They also sent me to a concussion specialist. I had follow up care about the concussion for a month or so.  For about a week floowing the vaccine i was taking 800mg 3times a day for the tremor&#39;s and fever

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

                                                Immediately after vaccine I had a bad headache which was cleared up with Ibuprofen. Then 12 Hours after vaccine my arm became VERY sore, took my ibuprofen and alternated with Acetaminophen.  Then my face became very flushed (I used ice packs) and I got a mild sore throat. That night I had difficulty sleeping. I kept waking up with terrible body aches. About 24 hours after the vaccine I just had fatigue, mild fever, and chills. I slept on and off throughout the day and then started to feel better. But at about 32 hours post vaccine I started to feel worse. My headache and sore arm came back and I became very light headed and dizzy.

I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

This started on day 6 after the first dose and lasted a couple days. It was intense and tingling to the point of painful and hard to complete my job. I let my OB know because I am pregnant with due date of 7/22/2021 but they did not feel my symptoms could be pregnancy related. I did not seek further care from my primary care doctor because it subsided.

Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

Felt like a globes sensation without itching or hives.   Nurses at vaccine site checked vitals multiple times. BP at start of symptoms 152/106, HR 140, O2 sat 99%. EMS was called but I did not feel symptoms were worsening, my lungs were clear without wheezing or stridor. I made the decision to not have EMS transport me to the ER. Symptoms improved so I decided to not go to the ER. Symptoms returned moderately for which I took 25 mg tab of Benadryl. As time progressed, symptoms waxed and waned, about 4 hours after the vaccine the globus sensation in the throat has improved, but there is a globs sensation in the lower esophagus, almost GERD-like in nature.

Took Ibuprofen 400mg still was feeling the numbness and took another Ibuprofen 200mg  around 1400 for the still felt slight numbness.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl around 1700 because I still was feeling the slight numbness on right side of face. In the morning was not noting any improvement in the facial numbness and was feeling that the cheek muscles were tighter on the right side and causing subtle facial asymmetry.  I got worried and went to the ED. I was assessed,  diagnosed with facial paresthesia.  I was offered an MRI, I declined as I did not feel that I needed it at the time. Provider prescribed 40 mg of prednisone daily for 5 days, valacyclovir 1000mg  3 times a day for 7 days. After starting prednisone facial muscle tightness I was feeling improved, still felt slight numbness more so in the mornings the next 2 days. I took the full course of prednisone, I am no longer feeling the facial symptoms. I stopped taking valacyclovir on day 3, since I felt that the prednisone was what is helping and it was harder to evenly take it 3 times a day.

                                                Was driving home after waiting my 15 minutes. Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

                                                I was recently dx with early onset albeit mild carpal tunnel in both arms after a couple short numbness/tingling episodes over a period of several months. I started work at 6:45am today and suddenly noticed around 11:30am that if I bent my arms, rested on my elbows, or put any pressure against my elbows, that same numbness/tingling would shoot down my forearms and up my upper arms. I?ve never had this happen before and I have had no incident or added stress on/with my hands/wrists/arms. It?s almost as if the vaccine exacerbated this nerve issue. My entire body also aches but I was prepared for that possible side effect.

She held her hand to calm down. gave her the vaccination and 5 mins later the patient said she has a headache, was upset, and started crying. She covered her eyes with her hands and started to shake. She also went to her bed and was rolling in it. The facility called 911 and they came within 5 mins. They did confirm that the patient wasn&#39;t having a seizure. Patient was calmed down but still went with the paramedics to be checked out. When I followed up with the facility, they said it was an anxiety event and the patient is back at the facility doing well. Let me know if you have any additional questions.

A 25-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 12Jan2021 (reported as yesterday) around 11 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, lot number: EL0140 3-4. Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. First vaccine dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) was administered on unknown date via an unspecified route of administration for COVID-19 immunization lot number: EL0140. Patient stated that she experienced side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, fainting while going to the bathroom 14 hours after receiving her second shot of the Covid vaccine. She wanted to know if these were normal side effects and if she should seek medical attention. Patient reported the side effects that she had from the second dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She has gotten no answers regarding the side effects and she wanted to speak with someone about it. She got the second dose on 12Jan2021 (reported as yesterday) around 11 AM. She felt pretty normal.

                                                I sat at the hospital for 15 mins after my vaccine shot and was ok. However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

                                                broke out in hives all over her body; didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable; didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable; areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid, on 29Dec2020 at 18:40 (at the age of 25-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced broke out in hives all over her body on 03Jan2021, which was reported as medically significant. The patient also didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable and areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened on 03Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received her first dose of the vaccine on 29Dec2020 and said 5 days later she broke out in hives. The patient stated her hives began on the evening of 03Jan2021. She clarified she had hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable. She said she still had areas on her legs and ankles that were reddened. She said the reddened areas on her legs and ankles are not fully raised or itchy, like she had experienced with the hives on the rest of her body. The patient went to an urgent care on 06Jan2021. She saw a dermatologist for the hives on 07Jan2021, who suspected that since she did not have any prior history of hives, her hives are from the COVID-19 vaccine. She said the dermatologist told her there is no way to truly test if the vaccine caused her hives. The patient received an intramuscular unspecified steroid shot at the dermatologist and was prescribed methylprednisolone (MANUFACTURED BY: PAR PHARMACEUTICAL; Lot number: 1129091; Expiration date: Dec2021) 4 mg tablets in a taper dose pack. She also stated that she took the following over-the-counter medications: diphenhydramine hydrochloride (reported as: generic BENADRYL; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN; Lot number: 0MR0456; Expiration date: Sep2022) 25 mg tablet, taken as needed; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC; Lot number: 1652346; Expiration Date: Dec2021) 10 mg tablet, taken as one tablet up to four times a day; and hydrocortisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) cream. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all of the events as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of broke out in hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable was recovering and of areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events.

                                                Friday- headache 2 hours after injection. Right Eye twitch Saturday- body aches, headache turned into a migraine on the entire right side of my head. I could not lift my right arm, I was exhausted doing everyday things.  Sunday- migraine wouldn?t go away. I got body chills but it wasn?t until later at night. And my body aches became moderate.  Monday- my migraine went down to a headache but my body aches wouldn?t go away. I did not take any pills. Throughout the day. I was tired. It was hard moving around. I was kind of sluggish but not as much as Tuesday. Tuesday- severe body aches. Both my arms hurt but I thought it was just due to laying in bed after getting home from work at 2:30 on Monday. Severe pain in my shoulders and middle of my back. I did some stretches thinking maybe my body was just sore from laying down. Went to bed at 12 because I couldn?t keep warm and my back was killing me.  Wednesday- horrible ache though out my back I got up to move but it hurt so much. I?m walking so slow. I need to rest on the walls because it hurts so much to move. My headache is still there. I took midol at 1:30pm;  did not do much. I?ve been trying to move about and stretch but my body does not allow me. Even typing hurts I cannot keep a good grip on things. My arms, entire left side of my back and many thighs  are in pain

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

A 25-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number=EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at site of right arm on 20Jan2021 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medication included vitamin D3 and iron (SLOW RELEASE IRON) and daily multivitamin. Within minutes of receiving the dose on 20Jan2021 at 09:45 AM, dizziness, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, flushed, weakness, and shakiness. About an hour after receiving the dose on 20Jan2021, lethargy, chilled, in particular hands were very cold, pale color, mental fog, and slurred speech. The patient did not receive any treatment from events. The outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported temporary mental fog/mental impairment was likely related to first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I am a third-year medical student. Since receiving the second dose of the COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on Tuesday 2/2, I have had persistent and worsening muscle spasms of the torso. I presented to the Emergency room on 2/6 due to worsening symptoms and was admitted until 2/7. The neurology team evaluated my condition was not able to make a firm diagnosis. They believe the vaccine has caused a dystonic reaction. I was given benadryl 25mg to continue for one week q6 hours prn. However, benadryl has provided minimal relief. They also strongly recommended that I be seen by a movement disorder specialist at hospital ASAP.  However, due to the fact that I have insurance I am not covered for care from hospital. My insurance said they will review the referral which will take another 5-7 business days from today 2/9. As a medical student, I have had to miss one week of clinic rotations and will continue to miss vital medical training as well as my board exam this Friday due to my worsening symptoms. It has created such a negative impact on my life including pausing my medical training, and physically being incapable of driving or performing many of my basic daily activities. I live alone and near hospital. I am urgently requesting if there is anyway CDC can help me, a medical student who has put in her all to fight the pandemic alongside you.   I am extremely concerned about my symptoms and the panic that it has created for my family and friends. I hope that a rapid response can help me and my loved ones find some answers during these challenging times.

A week later on January 15 I started to itch from head to toe all over my body. On January 25 woke up with hives/rash that is on and off all over my body. I am still itchy and still occasionally have the rash. Have been to my pcp and a dermatologist and as of 1/9/21 they do not have a reason to how or why this happened.  Nothing in my daily life has changed soaps, detergent, food, drink, work gloves.

                                                Within 15 minutes my vision began to blur, I became shaky and disoriented. My heart rate increased and it felt as though my blood pressure decreased rapidly. After 30 minutes my symptoms had worsened and I was so disoriented I was not able to seek medical attention while being observed. I exited the building and once I got into my car my face (specifically under my eyes and on my cheeks) began swelling and a red burning rash appeared. By the time I got home (10 more minutes) I needed Benadryl immediately, I was not able to complete my sentences and all other symptoms had become more intense. I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours for the next few days due to the symptoms consistently rebounding. I had one episode of throat tightness but it passed without use of my epipen. I checked my pulse and blood pressure frequently with the lowest reading being 93/60. Lethargy, shakiness, confusion, high heart rate all are still present after 5 days. The rash went away after 48 hours.

At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

My first dose of covid vaccine I had a tingling tongue and face and just took some Claritin and Pepcid. The second time around my entire mouth went numb and it felt like there was something in my throat. My airway was not impacted but it felt off. I was given 25mg of Benadryl and monitored for half an hour with vitals every 5 minutes. I?m 14 hours out from the reaction and I feel fine now.

After the throbbing, I experience a general sense of discomfort in the area that lasts about an hour or two but that is no longer painful

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

By 2:00pm, had slurred speech; severe fatigue; red skin on hands, face, neck; balance problems and dizziness; swollen hands. That evening through the next morning, I was experienced severe flu-like symptoms, including vertigo, extremely severe fatigue, and full-body muscle aches. My temperature was slightly elevated (98.7) from my &#34;baseline,&#34; which is around 96.7. On Saturday, I was very tired, no appetite, still experiencing some vertigo and muscle aches. Symptoms improved overnight and by Sunday evening, I was mostly back to normal, with some lingering fatigue.

I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

                                                Within a minute after the vaccine was administered, I started to sweat a lot, felt hot, and got very dizzy. I was also nauseous. The nurse was very responsive and had me put my jacket on, zip it all the way up, and allowed me to lay down. She provided water and snacks. I was very dizzy for 5-10 minutes. The nurse helped me perform calming excecises, which helped a lot. I then slowly started to feel better. After about 30 minutes I was able to stand up and felt mostly normal. It has been 3 hours and I am only a little fatigued, but otherwise okay. I have not had any issues with shots in my adulthood, but as a child, I remember turning white and vomiting after a flu shot. So I may be subconsciously adverse to shots.

I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

                                                After getting the 1st dose of Pfizer I was fine the only real side affect I had was that my arm hurt badly. After my second dose my arm initially didn?t hurt but started to hurt hours later. I had cough and sore throat but the worse thing was I woke up with super puffy red eyes with green discharge coming out. I was fine until I got the Pfizer vaccine. The morning after I felt terrible. I called my doctor to see what he can do or prescribe for my eyes.

                                                My daughter experienced immediate nerve pain at the site, L deltoid; followed by radiation to her fingers.  Then, she complained of extreme muscle pains, all over; itching and shortness of breath with formation of mucus in her chest.  She has interstitial lung disease and is well aware of what mucus-filling in her chest (lungs) feels like.  She also had headache and coughing and this necessitated using Benadryl 50mg, her Xopenex rescue inhaler at the site; followed by contacting of her pulmonologist for future treatment and instructions.

Chills, fever, aches, nausea, dizzy.   Dizziness came back intermittently on March 8 along with on and off bilateral tingling of hands and back of calves along with occasional feet.

I recieved the injection in my right arm. It was a dull achey pain but upon palpation became a sharp shooting pain that radiated from my armpit into my back and under my ribcage. There was also swelling and it to hurt have my right arm resting along my side.  Today, on 4/2/21, I am still experiencing this pain, however, it is less severe. To treat, I have been taking 2 acetominaphen approximately every six hours. It still hurts if I am to rest my arm at my side.

                                                I&#39;d had Bell&#39;s Palsy (BP) twice in my life (once in 2013 and once in 2015). I have not had it since 2015 until I got vaccinated on 3/29/21 and began to develop BP symptoms on the evening of 4/6/21 (headache on right side of my head/temple, odd sensation on right side of my tongue, almost like I burned it on a hot beverage) but I didn&#39;t think anything of it. I went to sleep and then, on the morning of 4/7/21, I woke up feeling extremely fatigued, brain fogged, and weak. I didn&#39;t notice any of the BP symptoms until I went to brush my teeth and realized I had lost motor function in the right side of my mouth. I immediately made a telehealth appointment with an Urgent Care doctor in order to get an Rx of Prednisone. I began taking the Prednisone around 3pm on Wednesday, 4/7/21. I also have been taking vitamin B-12 and a Women&#39;s Multivitamin to help regenerate nerve function.  However, since starting the prednisone, my symptoms have continued to develop. Symptoms currently include: right side of my face is extremely swollen; I have lost mobility on the right side of my face, the right side of my tongue still feels numb; right eye tearing non-stop; some mild ear pain in right inner ear; slight pins-and-needles sensation in my fingers on my right hand; difficulty eating and drinking; still feeling fatigued.  I have recovered from BP twice before so I am not too worried about having it again. I just think the FDA needs to put out a warning to the public that there may be a correlation between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and Bell&#39;s Palsy recurrences. I know this is not a coincidence, and my BP relapse was a result of my body experiencing an immune reaction from the vaccine.

                                                After almost two weeks I started feeling feverish and achy all over my body. I had head pain almost to the point of migraine, felt weak and lost my appetite. Every time I stood up I felt sharp pain on the top of my head and got lightheaded. These symptoms responded a little to medication such as Tylenol and DayQuil but steadily worsened over the course of a few days then suddenly worsened. I woke up yesterday feeling more feverish and weak to the point where my mobility was compromised. My head felt like a balloon and hurt around the base of my skull and the top of my head. I had even more severe light sensitivity and could not tolerate sound. I also couldn?t bend down to pick something up or tie my shoes because of the lightheadedness and pain. The headache and migraine symptoms responded well to Toradol and Excedrin but returned full force after any medicine wore off. I am not getting any better despite rest and treatment.

                                                Patient fainted while sitting in the waiting area about 5 minutes after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine.  Patient was unconscious briefly, but woke up after less than a minute a little disoriented.  She was sweating and felt very hot, except for her hands that were cold.  We gave her water and an ice pack to cool her down and waited with her until paramedics came to treat her.  She seemed alert and that the issue had mostly resolved as she left with paramedics approximately 15 minutes later, but it is unknown what happened after she left with them.

                                                I noticed immediately that the shot hurt, and that it was almost as if I could feel both the beginning and end of the needle. This was unusual for me, because I don&#39;t usually notice pain with vaccines. (It may also be worth nothing that the vaccine was not as centered on the deltoid as usual; it seemed to be injected in a location more anterior than medial.) 36 hours later, while my arm was above my head doing my hair, I suddenly felt a sharp and painful tingling shoot down my arm, with pins-and-needles and numbness. The sensation reached from the top of my arm down the outside around the elbow and heavily culminated in my hand and fingers, especially pinky finger. This sensation somewhat subsided, but lasted for somewhere between 1 and 2 hours.  Since then,  I have experienced pain in my elbow, and sometimes hand/palm and shoulder, and weakness in my hand, fingers, and arm in general. I have described all the different feelings of it as the different stages of having hit your funny bone.

When I measured a few hours later it was at 137/90. It remained like that until the evening when it lowered back down to 120/87. Later that evening, I had a fever and took Tylenol to help. My headache got worse in the evening as well. Arm was sore. This morning (day after my 1st dose) my BP was at 108/79, fever creeped up as the day went on, body aches, arm was hurting more,  headache continued, pressure on chest made it a bit hard to breathe, dizziness, some nausea, brain fog.

                                                Swelling and redness of the arm within an hour after the vaccine. Tingling began in middle, ring, and pinky fingers within 20 minutes of injection. Numbness began within the first hour. Within two hours, I lost strength and 60% use of my left hand. The pinky and ring finger of my left hand have been either completely numb or tingling ever since my shot over one week ago.   I noticed mild numbness about 3-4 days after the first dose, but assumed I had just slept funny. When my arm became red and hand became tingly after my second dose, I realized this was an effect of the vaccine and not merely a pinched nerve in my sleep.

                                                The first dose of the Pfizer vaccine was taken on March 15th at 8:30. Within a week I started feeling weak joints, headaches followed by a sharp pain on the occipital lobe. I started my period for the second time that month, which was odd because it never happened to me before. I went to work that week, but by Friday (March 30th) I was not able to handle the pain so after work I went to the doctor and they took blood to see if there was anything going on. The result came back the following day and everything was normal. I was given medicine (muscle relaxers) for the occipital pain, but it was not enough. At that time I was not sure what was the cause of it, I thought it was a bad flu, but I didn&#39;t come to the conclusion that it was because of the vaccine, because a week had passed by, so I thought it was impossible. The doctor asked for me to take an X-Ray for the occipital pain, so I did (March 30th) and it resulted in everything being fine. She also recommended for me to get an abdominal ultrasound to see if my uterus was fine due to the second period. I currently took the second Pfizer dose in the same location, but this time around I felt all of these symptoms within 3 hours of the vaccination. I started feeling lightheaded and dazed, my joints started feeling weak, my mouth and tongue started feeling sensitive (fever blisters and sensitive to anything that is acidic, spicy, etc).  I have not visited the doctor this time around because the pain is tolerable. I have noticed in increase of joint pain as the days go by.

My technician states the patient did not hit her head on a wall. At 2:51pm my pharmacy technician brought the incident to my attention and we both ran to the patient to address the situation.  The patient was unresponsive, so I ran and dial 911 then instructed my tech to take the phone. I then ran back to the patient and patted her back, said her name and asked her if she could hear me.  It was at that moment the patient&#39;s eyes flickered and the patient had what looked to me like a 10 second seizure in the chair inside the pharmacy booth.  Once the patient was done what I could only identify as seizing, she came to and I asked her if she new her name and where she was. The patient answered correctly and then asked me &#34;Have you had anyone with a reaction like this before?&#34;. I answered that I have not personally witnessed a reaction like this before. My technician had 911 still on the phone and they instructed her to stand out front of the store to await the ambulance. A first responding officer came in and asked about the witnesses to the incident then took over for caring for the patient.

In the night when I was sleeping, I woke up around 2am in extreme amount of body pain and aches, a huge headache, a high fever or 101.9 and my whole body was chilled even though I had a fever and was burning hot.

                                                I received my first shot on April 6th, 2021, and on April 18th, 2021 I experienced extreme numbness with slight pain in the fold and shoulder of my arm. I went to the ER and they took a cat scan of my neck and reported back that everything looked normal - the nurse said it was most likely Cervical Radiculopathy. Then the following morning around 11 AM, I experienced very intense burning in my chest starting on the right side, eventually moving to the left encompassing my entire upper chest. I also experienced a very bad migraine, which I am typically used to but this one was more of a pressure headache between my temples that I felt in my ears and jaw. I made the decision to go back to the ER and to a different one this time. The ER failed to administer a Covid-19 test and to take bloodwork - both faults that family and friends in the medical field have pointed out to me. The doctor there had me receive an IV, a chest X-Ray, and an EKG. The X-Ray and EKG were both normal. The doctor had ordered a Covid-19 test but the nurse forgot to administer it before my discharge. In my IV I received Benadryl and Reglan along with typical IV fluids. I was also given Pepcid and Mylanta. At the end of my visit, the doctor concluded that he thought it was my acid reflux acting up - gastroenteritis. I went home and continued to experience chest burning, tightness, occasional numbness/pains in my body, and very, very bad headaches. On top of that, I could barely swallow - it felt as if my throat was closing. I took Pepcid and Tums and neither really did anything. After seeing a Cardiologist this same week, they ordered an Echocardiogram and routine bloodwork (metabolic panel). I will also be following up with a GI, and I received a Covid-19 test today and am awaiting the results. It is possible I contracted Covid before my shot, but it is also possible that I am having a delayed reaction to my first vaccination as well. Who knows.

Starting around 1 pm on 1/11/21, I started experiencing burning nerve pain in my left foot. This pain lasted about 5 weeks, fading in intensity over time. I have previously experienced this pain before (starting around 9/1/19 after spraining my ankle); however, this pain was resolved by the beginning of May 2020. So it felt like the 2nd dose of the vaccine had triggered this previous pain. I did not seek treatment for this issue. It resolved on its own.

A bad migraine, unable to stand because it caused so much pain in my head. at 8:00PM I went to bed due to the pain. at 1:15 AM, my body was in pain. My right rib cage hurt so bad that I couldn&#39;t sleep on my right side. My legs, back, and pelvic bones were in so much pain as well. I felt as if my bones were going to break or I had severely bruised my bones. Breathing, coughing, sneezing hurt because of my rib cage hurting. My migraine had not gone away, and my lymph nodes were really swollen. Couldn&#39;t put my arms down, my neck was swollen and walking hurt because my legs were swollen. This occurred for 24 hours. Next day, migraine is gone and left a headache. Swelling is still prominent and bones still hurt.

The patient shortly after expressing this concern slumped over in the chair, shaking and twitching, for a few moments (likely 60 seconds or less) before regaining normal stature and attention. The patient expressed some changes in her field of vision, a continuation of feeling light-headed, and a ringing in her ears.  EMS was called to evaluate the patient, concerned that the patient had experienced seizure activity. EMS arrived shortly after, evaluating the patient&#39;s current state and vitals. After assessment, EMS determined this was a syncopal episode related to the patient&#39;s anxiety around the vaccination and cleared the patient to drive themselves home after resting on-site. Patient rested and recovered in pharmacy vaccination room for an additional 20 minutes before leaving.

She was offered a chair to sit on but within 5 minutes of sitting down she said she was not feeling any better. While I was talking to her she seemed to have a mild seizure-like episode which lasted less than a minute. After she became alert she said her thumbs were cramping up and asked us to call 911 for her. Paramedics took her to the hospital.

                                                Patient called this morning to report that she started to experience dull, numb, and tingling sensation last night at bedtime. She ignored it but sensation did not go away. Sensation has extended from top to bottom on the right side of her body. In addition, she started having heart palpitation this morning. She called MD but they referred her back to the pharmacy. She is currently taking amitriptyline and stated that in the past on September 2019, she experienced the same heart palpitation when her body was under great stress. She does not think this is serious enough to go to urgent care at this time and will continue to monitor. Rph educated patient that paraesthesia is listed as one of the side effects on CDC website for this vaccine and recommended patient to continue to monitor the side effects. If symptoms worsen, she will need to go to the emergency room. Also, Rph recommended patient to potentially avoid second dose since her body has a strong reaction against this vaccine.

During the follow up assessment she was asked if she had any reactions from the 1st vaccination she claims that she reported to her manager that time that she can&#39;t move the right side of face and right eye twitching. She also verbalized that the eye twitching was intermittent for 4-5 days. Never consulted a doctor or ER visit.  After vaccine administration she was required to sit for observation for 30 minutes. No reported reactions. Was advised to call the vaccine clinic or RN will call her for follow up. At 14:15 pm RN called above employee while still at work. She claims that the twitching started again on the right eye accompanied by slight throat tightness. Denies any c/o SOB, difficulty of swallowing. Instructed to go to ER but she verbalized she will go home and then go to urgent care if needed but still refused to go to the hospital ER.

                                                After receiving my second dose, I was seen by my primary doctor for suspected Celiac disease (which came back positive). I had a strange medical episodes during the bloodwork (April 15th) that they originally assumed was anxiety. Symptoms were shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and loss of feeling in extremities. I?m a first responder and did not feel this was anxiety, but didn?t argue and forgot about it until it happened again.   I had my second episode on April 20th, and debated going to the ER for it. A third episode on April 23rd did put me in the ER. I proceeded to have more episodes on almost a daily basis after that and started monitoring blood pressure, pulse, blood sugar, and food intake at home (some of my bloodwork levels were off due to the celiac). I purchased a heart rate monitor, a blood glucose meter, and a smartwatch to monitor some of my symptoms. Both devices (monitor and watch) would later flag me as having a suspicious heart rhythm (heart monitor could be for fast/slow rhythm or for arrhythmia, smartwatch flagged me as Afib twice). I could not recreate these results when my husband wore the devices.  Episodes could be as brief as 45 mins or last more than 12 hours. I have a high pain tolerance and illness tolerance, and had to leave work several times due to my symptoms (extremely abnormal for me).   After several more appointments with my primary doc and another visit to the ER (where they did another EKG, an X-ray, and more bloodwork), things were still coming back inconclusive.  After about April 28th, I started having significant chest pain with my episodes. The ER checked me for possible clotting related to the heart issues and my birth control pills. My arrhythmia could not be captured on their devices.   My doctor has since diagnosed it as suspected myocarditis (pending more testing). We?ve ruled out all possible things related to my Celiac diagnosis, and can?t seem to find a cause for this. I had a few things I brought to her attention that may be the cause (pinched nerve at chiropractors, covid vaccine) and she says it may be the vaccine, and said I should report it to you.
