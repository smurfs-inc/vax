                                                Patient in clinic for chief complaint of possible side effect of the covid vaccine which she received yesterday.  She states that she woke up at 0200 with chest tightness, achyness and headache.  She rates the discomfort 7/10 last night and improved now to 5/10.  She denies any worsening with any type of exertion and states that she can do simple things like take a shower, walk across the room, down the street or even stairs without any worsening.  She denies any SOB or chest pain--just feels tight.  Doesn&#39;t feel like she can&#39;t get a full breath or get the air out of her lungs either.  She received her first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday (4:23pm) and had no difficulty with the injection itself and then 9.5 hours later woke up from sleep with this chest tightness as well as achyness and headache.    She states that she had the exact same symptoms when she had positive covid test back in August of this year with the addition of fatigue which lasted for 5 days.  At that time it was not felt necessary to do any further testing nor treat with steroids according to cardiology.  She does have history of LV non-compaction cardiomyopathy and her last visit with cardiology was about 2 years ago and she had a normal EKG and echo only showed &#34;mild LV non compaction at the apex&#34; at that time. He did not need to see her again until she is 18 unless she has problems.  She states that she generally does very well and other than this tightness she does not have any other significant symptoms.

Paramedics were called, vitals taken, and she was taken to an observation area. She started to feel a bit better after about 15 minutes.  She was observed by paramedics and a nurse for another 30 mins and we were able to leave and go home. At home she was exhausted the remainder of the night.

                                                Patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 17, 2021.  On or about Feb. 22 or Feb. 23, 2021, she began to notice trembling in her jaw.  She told me (her mom) about the trembling on Feb. 25.  She had just increased her dosage of Venlaxafine on Feb. 21, 2021, so we actually thought that the jaw tremor was due to that.  As a result, at the direction of her psychiatrist, we began to taper off the Venlaxafine beginning on March 1.  Over time, the jaw tremor was less noticeable.  However, on March 10, 2021, patient received the 2nd does of the Pfizer vaccine.  The next day, March 11, 2021, the jaw tremor was worse than ever.  I can see the tremor - basically, her lower (?) jaw trembles and you can see the trembling in her mouth and chin.  It does not cause pain, and she does not have any other symptoms (no chills, fever, body aches, rashes, difficult breathing, etc.).  We talked to her pediatrician and to her psychiatrist.  Neither one could say what is causing the tremor; perhaps it is the COVID vaccine; perhaps it is the Venlaxafine (she&#39;s not all the way off of it yet); perhaps something else.  However, given the timing of the tremor, and given that the strength of the tremor seemed to get better but then got worse again the day after the 2nd COVID vaccine shot, I wanted to report it.

                                                Fever, chills, extreme fatigue, lightheadedness and very sore arm, but more importantly chest tightness that became increasingly worse over 48 hours. My daughter dealt with the other symptoms but her asthma became less treatable over the two days since the second shot. I finally administered the nebulizer and inhaled steroid today after all other treatments failed to relieve her symptoms. She is doing better but I will follow up with the pediatrician.

                                                My daughter had her vaccine at 6:15 on 4/7/21. She complained of a horrible soreness in the site of the shot, headache, and fatigue. Those were her only symptoms. I gave her ibuprofen. She stayed home from school and rested. I checked on her, and she said her headache was getting better. She had a seizure at work around 4:15 pm on 4/8/21. Her co-workers called 911, and the ambulance took her to the Medical Center. They did a head CT and ran labs. They were unsure if she had passed out or had a seizure. They gave her ibuprofen for the headache and told us to follow up with our PCP and monitor her for the weekend. She had another seizure on 4/8/21 at 10:30 pm. We called 911, and they took her to the Medical center again. They gave her Keppra and called a hospital to see if they wanted her transferred. The hospital said to provide her with the Keppra, follow up with them on Monday the 4/12/21, plus sent us home with a prescription for Keppra. They sent us home at 2:00 am on 4/9/21. I gave her the Keppra at 10:30 am on 4/9/21. She had another three seizures back to back. The EMT had to provide her with something to stop the seizures because I could tell she was about to have another one. They took her to the hospital, where she continued to have several episodes in the ER. They admitted her and gave her a higher dose of Keppra. They hooked her up to an EEG and determined that the seizure, not epileptic seizures, was brought on by stress. They released her from the hospital on 4/11/21. They told us that we needed to reduce her stress and follow-up with Neurology on 4/12/21. We could give her ibuprofen and Benedryl for the pain. She has several seizures a day, and is having numbness on her left side which they knew before releasing her. Her headache has never gone away. I keep telling them she has a horrible headache and the more seizures she is having the worse they get throughout the day. On 4/11/21, she had 17 episodes total and Monday, 4/12/21,  21 episodes. On 4/13/21, we took her back to the ER but this time took her to a different hospital. They were not able to treat because they wanted her to be seen by a pediatric neurologist. The hospital transferred her to another hospital. Where she was admitted on 4/13/21 and once again ran labs and hooked her up to an EEG. They told us they are not epileptic events and don&#39;t worry. They treated her for a chronic migraine. Sent her home telling us to give 3 ibuprophen, 2 Benedryl, and 1 Reglan every six hours until the headache is gone. She still has a severe headache and having seizures.

A 16-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 24Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included truncus arteriosus (status post (s/p) right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduit and prosthetic aortic valve s/p automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) placement) and arrhythmias. The patient have no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included sotalol taken for arrhythmias and warfarin. The patient was therapeutic on warfarin (INR 2.68) at admission and has been historically very compliant with medication. On 29Mar2021 14:00, the patient experienced acute infarct of right (R) internal capsule and R basal ganglia as diagnosed (dx) on magnetic resonance imagine (MRI), concerning for (C/f) cardio-embolic etiology in the setting of patient&#39;s complex cardiac history. However, cannot rule out other causes of infarct. Left (L) sided motor deficits on exam, L facial droop. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was unchanged from prior. The patient was hospitalized for the events from 29Mar2021 to 05Apr2021. The patient underwent other lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 nasal swab test was negative on 29Mar2021 and on 30Mar2021.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) via Medical Information team. A 16-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 02Apr2021 at 10:15 (batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was reported as a &#34;drive thru COVID-19 vaccine clinic.&#34; The patient&#39;s parents thought it was best for the patient to take the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, since she was eligible to get it so she would be protected. Relevant medical history included acne on the face from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included isotretinoin taken for acne on the face, which she took for almost 3 months from an unspecified start date to 19Apr2021. The patient had no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine, since this was her first dose. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect vaccine. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and had no adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the AEs. On 17Apr2021 at about 16:15 in the afternoon, the patient experienced seizure. It was further reported that the patient had a side effect after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine; the patient had a seizure 15 days after receiving the vaccine. The reporter was asking if seizure had been reported with the vaccine. The reporter had no idea for sure if it was the vaccine, but he wanted to let Pfizer know. The reporter was hoping the patient would be okay and it won&#39;t happen again. The patient would see her physician at the time of the report on 21Apr2021 in a few hours. They would listen to the doctor at the appointment, and they had an appointment with the neurologist to see if she should get the second dose on Friday. They didn&#39;t know yet. The reporter didn&#39;t have the vaccination card with him. The patient had no conditions other than this event. The patient went to the emergency room for the event on an unspecified from which she had blood tests, urine tests, and a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of her brain and they said they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong at that time. They needed to follow up with the hospital in the area to see a neurologist, which they would be doing the following day. They told them to follow up with the neurology department at their Hospital and told them until they find out more information; the patient could do what she needed to do, but she couldn&#39;t drive a car. The reporter asked if Pfizer has had any reports of this and wondered if there had been other reports of seizures. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

This report is for the second dose. A 16-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 31Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history includes catamenial epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Patient had no other vaccines in 4 weeks. Patient had no known allergies. Patient had not had COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA) taken at 1000 mg twice daily to help control seizures, start and stop date were not reported and amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 (Lot number EN6206) on the left arm at age 16 years on 17Mar2021 at 10:30AM for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced worst seizures. Reporter&#39;s daughter has been diagnosed with catamenial epilepsy, and has been taking 1000 mg KEPPRA twice daily to help control seizures. The shortest duration between seizures was approximately 1 month, and that was before her epilepsy diagnosis and starting on the KEPPRA. She has recently suffered a cluster of seizures which is atypical for her. Last night, reporter read an article about some women starting their periods after years of not having it soon after receiving the COVID vaccine, so reporter looked back at her daughter&#39;s seizure record and noticed a potential link.Patient had her first Pfizer COVID Shot on 17Mar2021, and she experienced her worst seizure ever on 27Mar2021 (10 days after COVID vaccine). On 31Mar2021, patient had her second Pfizer COVID Shot and she experienced her second worst seizure ever on 10Apr2021 (again 10 days after the second COVID vaccine. Again, her daughter has never had seizures occur in such a short duration, with the minimum time between seizures being one month. The adverse reaction resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient was treated for the event which is increase in KEPPRA dose to 1250 mg. Patient had not been tested with COVID-19 post vaccination. Vaccination facility was at a public health department. The outcome was unknown.   No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Pulse ox was 99.  There is no labored respirations.  She did not respond to commands but according to his sibling she does not always respond to commands.  However when I took her hand to get her to squeeze my hand and gave it back to her she purposefully put it back on a CD which she was holding to her chest.  Blood pressure was stable heart rate was approximately 130.  The home care aide was not able to tell me whether or not this was her baseline.  Her brother said that she does not does not answer questions depending on the day.  However I am not sure he is the appropriate historian.  She has a history of multiple medical issues including autism, quadriplegia, asthma, and food allergies.  As such she was kept here for a full 30 minutes.  At no time was there any color change.  No labored breathing or wheezing on exam.  There is a little bit of nystagmus and appeared to focus when questioned about how she was doing but without a verbal response.  She will be transferred to the emergency room in stable condition emergency room has been notified.

Within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, patient felt very faint, dizzy, nauseous, tingly, lost feeling in lower body, blurry vision, and started shaking.  EMS was called at vaccination site.

By that time, patient could sit up and was alert and oriented.  Patient never lost consciousness.  Patient was not taken to the ER.   Patient remained on-site for another 45 minutes until symptoms resolved enough that she felt it was safe to leave.  Patient has not had a reaction to vaccines or other medical treatment in the past.

She had already been given an IM Epi Pen injection of epi by the PA prior to my arrival.  I had her lie supine with head down and legs elevated and she felt better.  She declined EMS transport to ER.  Further talk with her dad revealed she had been up since 2 am and had no breakfast.  I don&#39;t think an allergy.

The reporter called to report that her daughter had a severe reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in her left arm. Less than an hour after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed goosebumps and chills in her left leg. The reporter was not very concerned about it at the time. About 9:00PM that same night, the patient started complaining of pinching in her left shoulder. The reporter was not too terribly concerned. By 9:30PM, that same night, the patient started to have left eye twitches. Then they increased to eye spasms, then the patient could not open her eye or control her face. Then, it progressed to patients nose and left side of her face. At that point, the reporter tried to contact a nurse with the health insurance advice line. She waited for 30 minutes. The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to get worse, so the reporter took the patient to the emergency room.

Around 10:15PM, that same night, the patient started to get nauseous and a headache kicked in. The emergency department took patient straight back to a room. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The emergency department started an IV on the patient, and they administered Reglan, Benadryl, and Toradol to treat her symptoms. The emergency department ran blood tests, preformed a urinalysis and a CT scan. The reporter did not know what all blood testing that was done revealed; however, the reporter did know that they told her that none of the testing revealed anything and were all normal. The patient was eventually discharged from the emergency department at about 1:50AM. She was sent home with Butalbital, for headache and was advised to take ibuprofen.

The patient never vomited, was only very nauseous. The reporter also stated that when the woman was administering the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the woman said &#34;oops&#34; and it was not explained what &#34;oops&#34; meant. The reporter asked if it was possible that the patient received the dose subcutaneously and that was why she had these side effects.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not take other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took Excedrin and experienced allergies. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 09:45 AM (Lot Number: EL9269) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. On 24Feb2021 at around 7:00pm she started getting a migraine at the base of her head. She then was lethargic, and became extremely nauseous. She started getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes (inability to control temperature regulation). Her heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down. Her ribs and lungs hurt. And her stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains. At one point it felt as if she could feel every cell in her body if that makes sense. Not the worst pain she had experienced but definitely not pleasant. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being run over by a car and 1 being a paper cut) she would say it was a 5-6. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Facility type vaccine was facility. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and did not have COVID test post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

An 18-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EW0170), intramuscular, administered in the right arm on 20Apr2021 at 12:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. On 20Apr2021 at 12:45, the patient and her father moved into the waiting area with vehicle. According to the patient&#39;s dad, the patient began seizing in the car one minute after the vaccine administration. The dad called out to waiting area monitor. At 12:57 the patient was visibly having tonic clonic seizure and was administered with EpiPen in the right Leg. 911 was called. The patient stopped seizing and was awake and confused. She then became AOx4 (oriented to four spheres; time/place/person/situation). The patient visibly distressed and hyperventilating. At 12:59 the patient had tonic clonic movements and seizure again. The seizure lasted less than 15 seconds. The patient then became AOx4 again, distressed, and became nauseous. Heart rate (HR) was 56 and SpO2 was 98%.  At 13:00 the patient vomited while sitting up. The patient was still distressed and hyperventilating with respiratory rate (RR) of 30. The patient&#39;s post vomiting HR was 116 and SpO2 was 97%. The patient moved to a stretcher and moved to the shade. At 13:06 firefighters arrived and the patient had an HR of 114, BP of 141/46, SpO2 of 97%, RR 24 and AOx4. At 13:12 the ambulance arrived and the patient was taken to (Place). The events resulted in a visit to the Emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, and on close temporal association, a reasonable possibility cannot be excluded that the suspect drug BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine)  contributed to the occurrence of the serious event Generalised tonic-clonic seizure.

                                                seizure; This is a Spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). An 18-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Bipolar disorder, Depression, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medication included cariprazine hydrochloride (VRAYLAR) orally from 18Mar2021 to 02Apr2021 at 1.5 mg, daily for Bipolar disorder; escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) at 10 mg for Depression; amfetamine sulfate (EVEKEO) 2 times a day for ADHD; bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN) and mirtazapine (REMERON) for sleep (disorder). It was reported patient experienced seizure on 02Apr2021 after using concomitantly Vraylar, Lexapro, Evekeo, Wellbutrin and Remeron, experienced seizure after using concomitantly Lexapro and Wellbutrin. The initial report from the United States was received via Company representative originating from a nurse on 15Apr2021, regarding an 18-year-old female patient who experienced seizure, drug interaction, and labelled drug-drug interacton medication error following the administration of cariprazine hydrochloride, amfetamine sulfate, escitalopram oxalate, mirtazapine, Pfizer Covid-19 and bupropion hydrochloride. Allergan received the report on 16Apr2021. Reportedly, the patient began cariprazine hydrochloride 1.5mg daily orally for Bipolar disorder on 18Mar2021, had the Covid-19 vaccine on 01Apr2021, and had a seizure on 02Apr2021. The patient had no history of seizures. The reporter did not believe the seizure was caused by the cariprazine hydrochloride (causality for seizure was also reported as unlikely). The patient was taken to the emergency room but not admitted, treatment and outcome unknown other than the emergency room staff advised the patient to &#34;discontinue everything&#34;. The reporter assessed the relationship between cariprazine hydrochloride and the event of seizure as unlikely. Laboratory tests were not reported. The patient experienced the seizure one day after Covid 19 vaccine. Considering the short onset  latency, the vaccine was also considered co-suspect. The case in confounded by patient&#39;s use of co-suspect medications that could have lowered the seizure threshold. The following important missing medical information will be helpful for further case evaluation: medical history, indications and therapy dates for all suspects, action taken, lab results (drug blood levels), investigations, treatment, outcome. Treatment information was not provided. At the time of the report, the outcome of seizure was reported as unknown. This case was considered serious due to the following seriousness criterion: medically significant.  Information on batch number has been request.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. Contributory role of concomitant medications should also be considered. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

Around 3:30am (01/14/2021), I was awoken by intense chills.  I was restless throughout the rest of the night, having hot and cold flashes.  I woke up around 8:20am and felt that I had a subjective fever.  I was also experiencing intense body ache and headache.  I took my temperature and it showed to be 100.6ºF.  I was still experiencing chills despite also feeling hot at the same time.  After an hour, my temperature was 101ºF.  I took 2 naproxen sodium tablets (440mg) to relieve fever.  Around 10:45am, my fever reduced but my body ache and headache stayed at the same pain level.  Around 2pm, I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen (400mg).  My headache stopped around 8:00pm.  My body aches stopped the morning of 01/15/2021.

                                                On the day I took the vaccine, my whole left side became sore and numb. The soreness and numbness continued on through the next day. Friday evening, I had the same symptoms coupled with nausea, headache, and chills. Saturday, I continued to have slight soreness and nausea. Today (Sunday), I&#39;m still having a bit of soreness on my left shoulder where I took the vaccine.

                                                Awoke the next morning with severe headache, fatigue, muscle pain (?felt Like being hit by a truck?). Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

                                                Around 7-7:30 PM, I started to feel weird tingly feelings run up and down all of my limbs at the same time but it was over in about 2 minutes. Then I couldn?t stop my eyes from continuously rolling back into my head. That happened for about 4 minutes or so sometimes it would happen like 3 or 4 times in a row and sometimes it would be every 20 seconds or so. I was extremely confused and forgetful for the next 40 minutes and then I slowly began to be able to recall stuff.

                                                nausea; passed out; seizure; enlarged heart; hurt knee; sore mouth; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 19-year-old female non-pregnant patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 19-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no history of COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine: 2nd dose of Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine on 06Apr2021 in the right arm. On 20Apr2021 22:30, the patient experienced passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, enlarged heart, and nausea.  The patient reported, &#34;I was fine all day until around 10:30 pm I went into my mothers room and she was asking me how my arm feels I told her it was fine and right after saying that she said I passed out in front of her and then I began to have a seizure for about 50 seconds and then I woke up. After waking up from the event I had a hurt knee and sore mouth as well as an enlarged heart. I have no history of seizures in the past so it was definitely scary.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures taken included anti seizure meds, fentanyl, and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient recovered with sequelae from the events, passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, and enlarged heart. Outcome of nausea was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time. However, the information provided is very limited and does not allow for a complete medical assessment. Case will be reassessed if additional information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Received the shot at 2:10.  2:15, she was feeling light headed and tingly sensation in her extremities. She didn&#39;t let anyone know at this time.  The person observing her noticed she seemed  zoned out and asked how she was doing at about 2:17 and learned that her tingliness was  turning into numbness of  extremities focused on her upper body.  She started displaying other symptoms of a minor panic attack.  We monitored her for the full 30 minutes, had her walk around, drink water, etc. She claimed that while her numbness wasn&#39;t getting better, it also wasn&#39;t getting worse. It was starting to itch though, so she was given some benedryl.  She then went home for the evening where her roommate could monitor her.   Next day, she called in to confirm that her numbness/itchiness had turned into a rash on her chest which has disappeared. But now is experiencing diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness.  She was informed that these symptoms were within the normal range of immune responses, but that if she was too miserable, she could go in to urgent care for medical assistance. She declined to do so at that time (approximately 11:45 am).

Had headache for the rest of the day until 7pm but was not a migraine after the nap and Tylenol. I would never get this vaccine again. I would rather have covid 1000 more times. (I had it in October and no sickness I?ve ever had will ever compare to that two hours of hell.

                                                Patient reported symptoms of: tachycardia, shakiness, vision changes, tongue numbness and shortness of breath following the first dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine on 2/5/2021. Patient said that historically has experienced tachycardia and shakiness after getting a flu shot or booster a few years ago. Symptoms reported by patient were enough to suspect potential anaphylaxis, and patient consented pharmacist to administer epinephrine. Patient was then advised by the pharmacist to follow-up with her primary care doctor as soon as possible to report the incident and to discuss the risk versus benefit of the vaccine, whether recieving the second dose would be appropriate for her. Patient returned to assisted living facility for her second dose of the COVID19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 2/26/2021. Patient said that she discussed the incident with her doctor, was told it would be appropriate to get the second dose despite her reaction and was advised to take &#34;cautious measures&#34;. Pharmacist reviewed the patient information and screening questions, discussed the potential side effects and reiterated her risk of experiencing the same reaction with the second dose. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Patient stated that she decided on getting the second dose because &#34;her boyfriend is high risk and I&#39;m doing this for him&#34;. Pharmacist asked patient if she had any questions/concerns or additional information to add prior to getting her vaccine, and patient denied having any at that time. After administering her second dose, pharmacist instructed patient to stay in the observation area for at least 30 minutes and to ask the staff for water given her experience with the first dose.  Patient asked pharmacist how common it was for someone to get a reaction from the vaccine, and then mentioned that her family memeber had to drive her to the emergency room after her first dose becuase her throat was &#34;burning&#34;, and was told that her throat was &#34;a little swollen&#34; and recieved a second dose of epinephrine at the emergency room. Patient included this information after the fact her second dose was already administered.  Approximately 5 minutes after receving her vaccine, the patient reported similar symptoms that she experienced on 2/5/2021: tachycardia, vision changes, shortness of breath and chest tightness. After monitoring patient with no resolvement of her symptoms, patient was then given a dose of epinephrine by the pharmacist, and the paramedics were called in to assess patient and take her to the emergency room.

The same thing happened throughout the day on Sunday (March 7th) and the rash would get better and then worsen so it was very on and off throughout my entire body. On Sunday evening after I took 2 Benadryls the rash got worse on my right arm and a small area of my left arm (bubbly-like features appeared). I went to sleep after taking the Benadryl and when I woke up the next morning it was completely gone. Then on Monday (March 8th) I was fine all day no signs of rashes or itching and then around 5pm I felt a burning sensation on my face and when I looked in the mirror both of my cheeks and a small part of my forehead were extremely red. I then took 2 Benadryls again and went to bed. Today (March 9th) I do not have signs of a rash and have not felt itchy all day.

                                                I got Pfizer Lot EN6200 on 02/26/2021 around 3:30 pm in my left deltoid. The &#39;blister&#39; is on my right hand index finger (measured 9 mm by 7 mm at its widest points, has not changed size or character since appearing) with a fainter in color &#39;blister&#39; (5 mm by 3 mm at widest) present on my right hand pinkie. No &#39;trauma&#39; to the site. Nonblanching, two petechiae present within the ring finger&#39;s blister, two also present in the one on my pinky. Those petechiae have disappeared in the last two days, but the spots are still present. Red, not warm, sensitive to touch. I had no other symptoms from dose one of the vaccination, outside of a sore arm and some joint pain. Possibly fatigue, but that&#39;s likely just me being fatigued as per usual.

Pt was sitting in chair and was lowered to the floor when she slumped and started to have a seizure.  As soon as she was on the floor she snapped awake.  She was disoriented for a moment but was aware.  After a few minutes she sat back down in chair and her blood pressure was taken.  it was 139/81 with HR of about 79.  The fire department came in at this point.  Eventually, the fire dept released her as she was with her mother.

I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

                                                Patient lost consciousness for a minute while waiting in the pharmacy after her vaccination. She slid down from the chair she was sitting on and recovered consciousness soon after laying down on the floor. She mentioned she was dizzy but otherwise alright. No signs of allergy, had cold hands. Symptoms indicated syncope but witnesses mentioned they saw her having a small seizure, where she threw her hands and head back before sliding down. 911 was called, they checked her and walked her to her car and let her go with a friend.

A 20-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on an unspecified date (at the age of 20-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) administered in arm left on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient ended up in the hospital with chest pain, tachycardia, shakes and cold sweats, 5 hours after receiving second dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: unknown results on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine can not be excluded for the reported events of chest pain, tachycardia, shakes and cold sweats due to temporal relationship.

The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                My right arm was sore almost immediately after being vaccinated, but it wasn?t bad. Then later at night when I was trying to get to sleep I was horribly restless, shaking, and feverish. I had to bundle up in blankets because I was so cold. My whole body ached terribly, and I had a headache. It lasted a few hours and I couldn?t get to sleep. At one point I felt extremely nauseous and ran to the bathroom, barely holding back vomit, but then it went away and never came back. The day after that (April 15th) I was extremely fatigued and still had body aches and a headache. I took my temperature at 5 am on April 15th and it was 99.4°. I mostly just slept a lot and didn?t have much of an appetite. My arm was still a little sore during this whole time. As I?m writing this at 5 am on April 16th, I still have a headache.

                                                Woke up about 12hrs after vaccine and felt incredibly nauseous and had chills. I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

She started to experience symptoms after 3-4 days after getting the vaccine. She wanted to know if it was normal to take that long to feel side effects or should she be worried about actually having COVID. There was no prescriber. She had it as a part of work.

Since then she will wake up in the morning with a slight headache. Soreness in arm was when it was first administered (05Jan2021), that was normal and she usually gets soreness no matter what vaccines she gets. This lasted for 2 days and then went away. She did say that the flu vaccine and some other that she did not remember the name of were the ones she remembered getting sore from. She did not have a manufacturer, lot or expiration for any of them. The fourth day was when she had a sore throat and coughing, that started in the morning when she woke up around 10:00. She had it all day yesterday and it was pretty severe and then she started getting better later in the night. Today it was less, but still here. She did take something to try and make herself feel better, so it definitely helped. Loose stool improved and today (12Jan2021) was yet to be known. Loose stool started in the afternoon of 06Jan2021. No ER (emergency room) or physician&#39;s office required Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks).

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown) on 17Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced arm was kind of sore and she was pretty tired, for which no admission to the hospital was involved and the patient did not receive any treatment. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. There were no other products taken together with the vaccine. The patient experienced worse sore arm on 07Jan2021 at 20:00 and experienced fatigue the next day on 08Jan2021 at 08:00. The adverse events (AEs) did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The patient recovered from the event &#34;worse sore arm&#34; on an unspecified date, while the outcome of the event &#34;fatigue&#34; was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

She states these symptoms are common due to her history of EDS but today they are slightly worse since she got the vaccine. She was brought to the medical evaluation area via wheelchair and evaluated by us and EMS. Patient was administered Benardyl 50mg and provided orange juice and water. Vitals taken throughout and were slightly high in the beginning and then stabilized. Patient states her throat felt better and the tingling localized to her hands after 5 mins. Patient was monitored for over 45 mins. She was instructed to contact her PCP and her allergist to be cleared for her second vaccine dose. She was informed her 2nd dose should be administered at a facility where she can be observed closely. She declined transport to the hospital but agreed to follow up to the ER with any worsening signs of anaphylaxis. The nausea resolved and she felt less groggy upon leaving with her boyfriend.

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

                                                Initially had localized redness, quarter to a half dollar sized swelling, on 3/10/2021. Patient received an iron infusion at 15:00 on 3/10/2021. Around 2:00 on 3/11/2021, patient felt a chill, her temperature was 100.4 F orally. Temperature further increased to 103 F around 13:00 on 3/12/2021.   What happened as a result of the adverse event? (doctor visit, ED or urgent care visit, hospitalization, life threatening illness, disability/permanent damage, death, none of these): none of these, took OTC apap last night and this morning and just took ibuprofen after the 103 F reading.  Spoke with patient&#39;s mother, who stated that the is feeling fine. The patient&#39;s temperature is currently 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and initially came back to normal at 02:00 today (3/13/21). The patient experienced elevated temperatures before that time (02:00), of note was at 22:00 on 3/12/21, at which time the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. A later temperature after 22:00 on 3/12/21, and before 02:00 on 3/13/21, was recorded, which was 101 degrees Fahrenheit.   The patient&#39;s mother stated that the daughter may have COVID based upon speaking with her doctor, so she inquired if her daughter should be tested for the presence of antibodies against COVID-19. Patient&#39;s mother also inquired if there was a need for the second shot if it was seen that her daughter had antibodies against the virus.  Advised the mother that her questions would be looked into for answers, and that she would be called back with those answers.

I went to the waiting area to check on patient and take her blood pressure.  while taking patients blood pressure she had a short (1-2 seconds long) seizure and lost consciousness.  Patient quickly regained consciousness and reported no additional symptoms.  EMS arrived on the scene quickly and patient left with them.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 09:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No family history relevant to adverse events. Patient has no concomitant medications. On 16Jan2021 09:20, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient felt like she was going to pass out reported as vasovagal reaction, and experienced heart beat was high, fatigue, woozy/dizzy, hard to concentrate, feeling hot, and felt as though she was on the verge of a headache but never got one/she felt like the blood was rushing to her head. On 16Jan2021 10:00, 1 hour after vaccination, the patient experienced had to fall asleep. On the day she got the shot she sat for a full hour with the nurse to be monitored. Then she went home. The events lasted from 09:20 until 18:00 on that day. 13 days after vaccination on 29Jan2021, 12:00 and ongoing until reporting time, the symptoms recurred about the same when they started. The patient was wondering if this could be a side effect 2 weeks after getting the shot or if she should look elsewhere on what could be causing these events. She is supposed to get the second dose on Friday and was wondering about getting the second dose after her experience. Patient wanted to know it is safer for her to have the 2nd dose. No physician office visit and emergency room visit. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was recovered on 16Jan2021 18:00.

I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

                                                I received my shot at 11:47 and started to lose sensation in my hands in the waiting area. After about 25 minutes I felt dizzy and was about to stand up but my muscles started shaking. My heart rate was checked and found to be 140. This lasted for about another 30 minutes. My heart rate went down and I was taken to a private area and checked out by EMS they gave me water and concluded it was some sort of panic attack. However, these are the same symptoms I have whenever I am allergic to a medication, NSAIDS, dicyclomine, etc. It always starts with ascending numbness from my fingers to the rest of my body. Then I start to shake and my heart rate goes way up. Usually I start to cough then vomit and my airway closes. Thankfully this time we were able to slow the process and I never experienced some of the last symptoms.

                                                Nerve pain throughout the entire body lasting approximately 18 hours. Felt like ants crawling through all my muscles. Not exactly painful, but aching and deeply affecting. Almost itchy like all my muscles needed to stretch but they were also exhausted. All nerves in my body were highly activated, including my taste buds. Could not taste because I could taste everything and the food ended up feeling like individual particles rather than a cohesive flavor. Some nasal congestion. Overall, felt like being sick, but worse. Exhaustion Soreness in left arm

Her first seizure followed ~30 minutes after vaccination and she continued to have 6 additional seizures over the course of several hours, requiring admission to the hospital for several days as she recovered from her post-ictal state. She was febrile on admission to 100.5F. Mother of patient noted that she has never had this many seizures in a single day before.

                                                Patient was nervous before the vaccination. After vaccination she started to feel hot and cold. Her hearing started to fade in and out. She sought help and was directed to lay flat on the floor and breathe. She started feeling light headed and that her vision was tunneling. Her appearance was pale and her hands were clammy. Her blood pressure was taken via wrist and was normal for her (112/72). The medical professional tending to her had her continue talking, asked her to state her DOB, name, age, the date, etc.  After about 5 minutes she started to feel better- she sat up and had some water and M&amp;Ms. She then laid back down but continued to converse with us. This took place over about10 minutes from first symptoms. She remained laying down for about 10 minutes after and then slowly sat up, and when she felt comfortable sitting she tried standing up. She then went home for the day (was an employee of the store).

About 40 minutes prior I had a snack and immediately after the shot I had another snack. I also had been drinking water. At one point I felt that I was close to passing out. I also had tingling/numbness in my feet/legs in certain positions and had to move them. I went through the drive through for the vaccine and so I sat in the car drinking water and breathing deeply for about 20-30 minutes. It gradually got better but never fully gone. When I got home some of the light headedness got a little worse when I had to stand up and walk even though I did it slowly. Even an hour after, side effects still lingering and have not yet gone as I fill this out.

It took almost an hour to get the symptoms under control, and even then, I still felt dizzy while dying down for another 4 hours or so. The dizziness was almost to the point of making me fall unconscious, and I felt very warm the entire time. The dizziness was followed by very severe shaking.

About an hour after that I vomited and experience diarrhea. Returning to bed I had trouble sleeping due to the chills and headache bordering on migraine. Once I did fall asleep I would wake up dripping in sweat and needing to go to the bathroom for more diarrhea. This continued for several hours and several trips to the bathroom. The whole day after my vaccine I was unable to eat food, even the smell made me want to throw up. I was cold and nauseous all day.

When she woke up seconds later of fainting, she felt throat pain like strep throat pain and then she started feeling very intensive cramps in her lower abdomen like very intense period cramps for about 10 minutes. The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital. But it was an immediate reaction that affected 3 different parts of her body that was very painful. During the day and the day after she felt very weak with no energy to get out of bed. &#34;I am wondering if I can still receive the second dose after this reaction to the first dose?&#34; No treatment was received for the events.

I was pulled over by the nurse immediately following vaccination of the recipient. The nurse informed me that the recipient had provided her a consent form with Pfizer vaccine information and indicated that she was there for her second dose of Pfizer vaccine. The nurse administered the Pfizer Covid vaccine and then reviewed the vaccination record card presented by the recipient at which time she discovered that the first document a dose of Covid vaccine was Moderna. She immediately informed the recipient and the recipient did acknowledge to me that she had requested the Pfizer vaccination as her second dose because she thought that&#39;s what she had received. The recipient had received a consent form with the Pfizer lot number when she presented to the registration desk indicating that she was there to receive her second dose of Pfizer vaccine. I informed the recipient of the CDC guidance which indicates that no further doses are necessary when a mixed series of Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines are  administered. I suggested that she could choose to inform her healthcare provider and to certainly report any adverse effects. The recipient reported mild cramping in her left hand while we were talking to her during the post observation. And she indicated that this might have been a psycho somatic symptom. We asked the recipient to stay an additional 10 minutes beyond the 15 required minutes for observation. She reported no further issues and that the cramping in her hand had resolved. Her mother later called the health office regarding the medication error.

I was fine with these symptoms as I knew they were common side effects until my heart rate spiked from about 60 to the 160s and I began to have a throbbing headache. I could not get my heart rate to come down, I was calm and knew it was not anxiety so I went to the ER where they did blood tests, EKG, UA and gave me fluids. Everything came back normal but my heart rate continued to be elevated around 130s for a couple more hours, finally came down to about 100-110, HR is still slightly elevated and I still have a fever of 100.4 and migraine

                                                I woke up this morning with a very severe right dry eye. It was not responding to water or eye drops which is the first time that has ever happened to me. After several eye drops, I was able to drive to work where I was fine except for the eye pain until 10am. Then I started getting body aches, light-headedness and weakness. On the drive home (40 minutes), I developed a fever and the body aches worsened. If I do not consume liquid continuously, I get very light-headed and weak.

Was feeling well prior to that.  Has soreness at her arm as well.  She has a history of POTS and did detect a rapid heart rate at home.  She has mild sinus tachycardia at this time reports a gradual improvement in symptoms.  Fever is improving, had not had any antipyretic prior to coming in.  I have low suspicion for acute infection and would favor immune response to the vaccine itself which has been reported in multiple persons receiving same vaccine.  She is not hypoxic, has clear breath sounds.  No thrombocytopenia on CBC.  IV was placed, IV fluids given.  Heart rate improved, blood pressure remained stable.  Patient feels well enough for discharge on reevaluation and declined need for analgesic or antipyretic here.

Pain is mostly at top of my lungs, going across my chest. Deep breathing sometimes helps but there?s also pain upon inhalation.  * Took the next doses of Advair and my Dexedrine (ADHD meds). Nothing weird yet just drained.   They switched my Ventolin inhaler to ProAir, I have been taking it about five times a week so I can workout. When I was on Ventolin I didn?t have any of the side effects I have with ProAir.

                                                I got my vaccine at noon on saturday Feb. 6th. Within about 12 hours of my second covid vaccine, I started to become fatigued and had soreness in my arm. When I woke up the next morning (approx 20 hours post injection) I was drenched in sweat, fatigued, had a headache, body aches (back and neck), and a temperature of 100.9 (taken orally). The rest of the day I had hot/cold flashes. I would go from sweating to shivering every 10-20  minutes. I had a consistent fever of 100.3-100.7 until about 8pm when it read 96.5. I took Tylenol at 7am that day and ibuprofen at about 7pm. Hot/cold flashes continued through the night last night. I am still having cold/hot flashes (drenched in sweat then full body chills, but not shivering). I&#39;ve taken my temp multiple times today and it has consistently read at about 97.1 without fever reducing drugs. My body temp typically runs normal (98.6). I currently still feel fatigued, have a slight headache and some aching in my neck and back.

Eyes felt swollen a few hours after receiving vaccine between 1-2 pm. Symptoms went away. At around 11pm I got welts and hives all over my body but they were particularly prevalent at the vaccine site. No change in routine throughout the day nor a change in food. Largely went away by the next day around 1pm. Still experiencing slight itchiness.

Took ibuprofen in the middle of the first night and it helped a little. Fatigue and some reasonable arm pain and neck stiffness continued for a while. Migraine has continued since the vaccination; it&#39;s been 5 days. I&#39;ve had to take at least 2 Advil every day to help it. Can&#39;t even complete an aerobic workout even with the Advil because my head is shaking so much. I&#39;ve had mild migraines before surrounding my period, but they always disappear when I sleep and aren&#39;t there first thing in the morning like this has been. I feel so bad, I find myself having to keep stop walking during the day when completing a task just to hold my pounding head.  Not sure what to do.

It began to radiate to the left, and Wednesday I went to Urgent Care because I was scared. My EKG &amp; chest x-ray were clear. Today I feel even worse with migraines, chest pain (that radiates up my neck and around my back), and overall feeling gross and exhausted. My head is what?s bothering me the most along with my joint pain.

By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

Outcome of all the events  was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  Coombs negative hemolytic anemia and other events  due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2.

                                                About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient complained about her left arm hurting. She also complained of chest tightness and difficulty swallowing. Patient also had vision changes. We gave the patient 1 tablet of Benadryl 25 mg and called EMS services. EMS checked her out and we advised the patient to go to the ER to be observed and given more Benadryl. Patient was able to walk out of facility herself.

This nurse reported similar events for 3 patients. This is the first of 3 reports.  A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away. She reported that this one is medically significant because even though she did not have shortness of breath, it could have affected her airway. She confirmed that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;had a tightness and lump in her throat&#39;, allergic reaction was not recovered (a s reported); while recovered on 27Dec2020 for allergic reaction like rash/red rash on her chest and rash was on her arms too and cheeks were flushed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events throat tightness, sensation of foreign body, allergy to vaccine, rash erythematous and flushing cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height.

Five hours after, the injection site had a pinkish color and felt sore. Then it was difficult to move my arm due to the soreness that traveled from my right upper arm to my right shoulder. I went to bed after taking Tylenol due to the headache and body aches. I woke up on 01/08/2021 with a severe migraine and general body aches. I took Tylenol in the morning and spent the day sleeping due to the migraines, malaise, and body ache. Throughout the day, I also experienced hot flashes and minimal nausea.

I had a fever of 103.0 at 3 am which proceeded to come down 45 minutes later and stay at 100.4 until 10 am. During that time I had a pounding headache, nausea, aches, chills and was profusely sweating and shaking with the fever.  Symptoms abruptly ended at noon on 1/11/21. This also occurred with the first dose that I recieved 12/23/20 at 5:30 however the fever and s/s were not quite as bad. This time they were definitely worse and prevented me from doing anything, I am glad I was not scheduled for work.

Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia. Symptoms became more mild at hour 31 post vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node after the first vaccine above my left collarbone (injected on left side) and still have this, and now I have a swollen armpit that is very painful on my right side (injected on the right side).

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Dec2020 (at the age of 23-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: allergies to medications, food, or other products (unspecified). It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well. The patient was taken to the emergency department for ongoing observation. The patient was released from emergency department after observation. The clinical outcome of flushed, hives, tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;, and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events flushing, urticaria, tong disorder, sensation of foreign body are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                On 1/20, I got a headache, dizziness, and my arm was extremely sore. Within about an hour, I became extremely nauseous and had both chills and sweats. I took my temperature at 6:00 pm on 1/20 and it read 99.7. I then took tylenol and at 8:30, I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. My normal temperature is 97.2-97.5. I took an ice bath at this point as my arm at the injection site was extremely swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. I called urgent care to see what medications I could take in addition to tylenol and they recommended motrin to bring down my fever. I woke up several times through the night and took medication. At around 8 am on 1/21, I took my temperature and it was 97.8.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

                                                Both my first and second vaccines I have and am now experiencing heart problems and troubles breathing. I&#39;m having chest pain and my arm feels like the achy pain of putting ice on a broken bone. The first vaccine I felt the pain start in my collar bone in the vein and move down. 2nd vaccine I feel like I&#39;ve been running a marathon and feel pain in my chest. Fatigue both times.

                                                So I received the vaccine on my left arm on January 20th and the next day I had swelling on my left arm and neck. It went away within an hour or so. However, on the 28th of January, I woke up with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on my left side of my neck. So, I have swelling and lumps/growths above my left collar bone. My left arm is numb and tingly and I feel very sick. I am nauseous and have body aches. I went to urgent care and they believe it is a reaction to the vaccine. I was tested for mono and strep throat and do not have either. I took a rapid covid test on Wednesday the 27th and it was negative.

                                                I received the COVID19 vaccine on January 22, 2021. I started to have chest tightness and somewhat of a dry cough midday on Monday January 25, which continued until January 27. I started having congestion and runny nose on January 27, so I went and got tested for COVID on the 27. The test came back positive on January 28. On January 28 I had extreme congestion and head pressure, a bad burning sensation from my left sinus that went back to my left 2nd molar, and a runny nose. I had not gone anywhere the week prior due to studying for an exam besides to lab at school twice where everyone was socially distanced and was wearing a mask the whole time. The highest my temperature got was 99.4 with Tylenol on January 28. In addition to this, my husband got covid tested on January 28 to see if he had it, or had given covid to me and his test came back negative. We had not socially distanced and still had physical contact the entire time, and continued not to do so in our house. We have had full contact the entire time because he is working from home and most of my school is online, and he got tested again on January 30 and came back negative again. If somehow I got covid from school in a short amount of time with everyone wearing a mask, how would he not get covid from me after a full week of exposure unless I was not contagious, which makes me think I somehow got it from the vaccine. I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, as I got the shingles when I was 4 as a direct result from the first chickenpox vaccine.

                                                After being vaccinated and while waiting in the observation area, I began to feel hot and light headed. I fainted about 15 minutes after sitting down in the waiting area and upon fainting hit my head on the floor. I regained consciousness while laying on the floor getting my vitals taken by staff. Because of the minor head injury and proximity to getting the vaccine, I accepted being taken to the ER.

                                                About 1.5-2 hours post immunization the patient returned having developed a headache and a quarter sized welt that was lightly red, swollen and very tender to touch, just below her left collar bone about 4 inches from the injection site. The welt was outlined and observed and the patient was given 25mg of Benadryl. After about 20 minutes the swelling and tenderness had spread to an area approximately the diameter of a tennis ball. At this point she was refered to see a doctor at the Health Center. The nurse called to follow-up once the patient arrived as she had not seen this type of reaction after the vaccine. After discussion the physician was going to look at her. Reportedly the swelling had begun to retract and the patient apparently returned to work later that day, talking about her plans to receive the second dose.

                                                A few hours after  receiving my second dose of the COVID vaccine, I was extremely fatigued. I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

At ER  they did an EKG (normal result), then received  ibuprofen (21:30), acetaminophen (22:45), meclizine (22:45). Was discharged at 23:03.

                                                After my first dose, I had a sore arm for a few days. After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

                                                The first day I got my vaccine, I felt  fine, but my arm with the injection sight was very sore and body slightly achy. The second day I woke up and my arm was sore, but other than that I felt normal. Around 4pm on the second day, my back started to hurt where the break break in my spine is. It was just a normal amount of pain at first, but within an hour there was throbbing pain in my lower back, spreading into my legs. This is where I normally feel my chronic pain, but I had a spinal injection a little over 6 months ago and doesn&#39;t usually stop working until about a year. It is the normal pain I experience in the normal places, but the pain is worse and out of no where. That is not usually how the pain comes on when the spinal block wears off. It is much more gradual. It could be a coincidence, but the pain is not the way I have ever experienced the pain.  My back hurts too much to do things I need to do to function, which only happens to me when I have done something with a lot of physical activity that puts tension on my back like jumping, dancing, roller coasters. Before I started experiencing this pain, it was just a normal day for me where I didn&#39;t exert my back any more than normal, which is very little.

                                                I got my vaccine on 3/19 at 10am. My 6:30 pm on 3/19 my face got dark red, almost purple and started to swell. I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 12Feb2021 10:45 (at age of 23-year-old)(Lot Number: EN6205) as single dose, and received the second dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Mar2021 11:15 (at age of 23-year-old) (Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Genearal anxiety disorder, had this for a while and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had for 4-5 years. There was no allergies to medications, food, or other products.Concomitant medication(s) included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) taken for generalised anxiety disorder from an unspecified start date and ongoing; spironolactone (SPIRONOLACTONE A L) taken for acne (She has an Intra Uterine Device and it was causing some acne) from Sep2020 and ongoing; lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE) taken for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from an unspecified start date and ongoing.  The patient experienced positive COVID-19 test with symptoms on 22Mar2021. The event was considered as serious with serious criteria medically significant. The patient also experienced a sore arm on an unspecified date.  The patient did not have any adverse side effects (other than a sore arm) postvaccination of her first and second doses. The patient did not travel or really even leave her house two-weeks postvaccine to ensure built up the proper immunity/antibodies. However, around three weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the patient tested positive for Covid-19 and am symptomatic. The patient was congested and experiencing horrible headaches, lost her sense of smell and taste, and am extremely tired/fatigued. She received the first Covid 19 vaccine on 12Feb2021, injection in the left upper arm. She started out feeling really congested like she was getting a cold on Saturday night, 20Mar2021. She didn&#39;t think much of it and then she started to lose her sense of taste and smell on Monday, 22Mar2021. She had coffee and she couldn&#39;t taste it. She got an appointment to get a Covid 19 test. The cold like symptoms have been subsiding. Now she is really fatigued. She has brain fog,  and felt like she can&#39;t work as efficiently or concentrate. Her Covid 19 rapid test was positive on Monday, 22Mar2021. She had the Covid 19 PCR test on Monday, 22Mar2021 but she does not have the results of that test yet. She also has a headache. She didn&#39;t think she had Covid 19 until she couldn&#39;t smell or taste anything. She is still a little congested. She is taking Mucinex because of the head pressure. Today (24Mar2021) she woke up and it&#39;s been her best day. She can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s getting her smell back, but she compares it to having the flu, she can smell just a sick smell. She can&#39;t describe it any other way, just that she can smell and taste a sick smell. The headache she describes as dull. She thought its related to the congestion. She&#39;s been taking Mucinex a dual day and night, 2 capsules. Mucinex Sinus Max Day is Acetaminophen 325mg, Dextromethorphan HBr 10mg, Guaifenesin 200mg, and Phenylephrine HCl 5mg. Mucinex Sinus Max Night is Acetaminophen 325mg, Dextromethorphan HBr 10mg, Doxylamine Succinate 6.25mg, and Phenylephrine HCl 5mg. She started taking Mucinex on Sunday night, 21Mar2021, the nighttime one, then she took a daytime dose on Monday, 22Mar2021 in the morning. She took 2 doses on Monday, she thought she can take up to 3 doses per day. Then she took the nighttime dose again on Monday night,22Mar2021. She took 2 doses on Tuesday, 23Mar2021 and she took nothing last night because her congestion is getting better. She did take regular Tylenol this morning for her headache. Tylenol 500mg 2 capsules. When asking the caller questions from the Vaccine Supplemental Form regarding lack of efficacy, she reports she was possibly in contact with someone who was infected with Covid 19 as she traveled for her spring break from Thursday, 18Mar2021 to Sunday, 21Mar2021. This is discrepant from what was previously recorded at the beginning of the conversation when the caller reported she&#39;s not sure how she got the Covid 19 virus, she really didn&#39;t go anywhere. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: positive on 22Mar2021, SARS-COV-2 TEST: positive on 24Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of positive covid-19 test with symptoms and a sore arm. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was resolving.

Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

The patient was not sure how long she was passed out for though she had no reason to believe it was long. She tried to sit up, but she really wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she laid back down and closed her eyes for a bit. Then she got super hot and sweaty.

I do have little bit pain on it; Vaccine administrator put the vaccine in the wrong part of the arm; She put further behind her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 24-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acne. Concomitant medication included spironolactone for acne. The patient was reporting an adverse reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She had two concerns. One concern was that she found that the vaccine administrator put the vaccine in the wrong part of the arm, she said, she put further behind her arm, these were her words and she complains that her right leg hurts when she sits down. She said, she works 12 Hours a day and the pain starts shooting down from her arm to her leg, the injection site is red and swollen and she was not taking any medication to alleviate the symptoms. On 31Dec2020, it was reported that the patient was little bit concerned the area, she stated, &#34;I know it is supposed to be swollen for few days but today it is still swollen, its red. I do have little bit pain on it but I was a little bit concerned because I was told by my coworkers and nurses. I am not sure they put it in the right area so I guess the nurse administered the vaccine, she put it like instead of like where they normally put the vaccine, she put it at the side of my arm like, not like behind my arm like normally, I was a little bit of concerned. Another symptom that I have been feeling that whenever I sit down my left leg hurts so much like I have been on my feet like, I am working for 12 hours straight away so I have been working on my feet for pretty much the entire day so every time I sat down only my side hurts, on the side where I take the vaccine, I don&#39;t know if there is everything to do with that, it is like tolerable pain but (sentence incomplete).&#34; No treatment for the events. The outcome of the events injection site is red and swollen was not recovered and unknown for the other events.  Information on batch number has been requested.

                                                I got the second dose to the Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/2021at 11 AM. I felt throughout the day and was able to finish my shift. Later that night, I had very strong rigors, chills, severe headache and felt feverish. I took some Tyenol and felt a little better. I woke up at 5 AM to go to work, and my body was so fatigued and tired I couldn&#39;t move. My hands were shaking badly, and my whole body hurt. My joints hurt, my muscles, ect. I called out of work, as I work in the Micro lab doing COVID-19 PCR testing, I couldn&#39;t pipet correctly if I was shaking. I do not have any pre-existing conditions, and I have no allergies. I have never experienced an adverse reaction to a vaccine.

The chest tightness continued until 1/23.  It was not a constant pain, but sometimes when I would move a certain way, my chest would hurt. The spot that hurt is right in the middle of my chest. It got worse when I would exercise and breathe heavily. The chest pain continued to stop and come back for several weeks. The night after I received the vaccine, I felt dizzy and felt as if I would pass out, but did not. This only happened one time and was better when I woke up the next morning.   The weekend after I got the vaccine, I was worried I might have covid, so I got tested for covid, but the results came back negative.

                                                I had nerve pain 8 on pain scale on 1/7, mostly centered on my back along my spine but when it was at its worst it was anywhere my skin was in contact with anything. First started feeling like my back itched at around 6:30pm. At 8:30pm, I started feeling exhausted and feverish. I took my temperature, it was 100.6 F, I took acetaminophen (2, 650mg tablets).  My symptoms did not get better and I started having chills and pain like needles stabbing me anywhere my clothes were touching me. I went to bed at around 11pm and tried to sleep unsuccessfully until 3am, tossing and turning in pain anywhere my skin was being touched, before trying ibuprofen (600mg, the dose I take for my migraines) which seemed to help and I finally fell asleep.  Next morning woke up feverish, exhausted, and in pain again. Once again ibuprofen helped and I continued taking it every 8 hours for the next day until my symptoms were no longer coming back when the dose was wearing off. Last ibuprofen was probably 10pm on 1/8.

She was not responsive and mildly shaking.  I gave her an Epipen shot and in less than a minute she was a wake and feeling much better.  She drank some water.  911 was not called because her mother was a nurse and was nearby.  She came and picked her up and took her to a doctor.  I checked on the patient this afternoon and she is feeling fine other than feeling tired.  She has a medical history of weight loss surgery and not dieting properly.  The administrator of the home  said she has a history of not feeling well and almost fainting from not eating properly after her weight loss surgery.

                                                I got my Pfizer first dose today and it was fine at first, but four hours later I was slammed with incredible arm and shoulder pain. I have a really high pain tolerance (tore my meniscus 3x with no surgery or pain meds, wasn&#39;t too bad) and I&#39;m 24F, not on any medications. I keep reading that sore arms are common, but this is a 6/7 on the pain scale. Putting on joggers was excruciating and I almost vomited. I can&#39;t even bring a glass to my mouth with that arm. Even laying as still as possible hurts. I cannot lift my arm past my pelvis and my shoulder is immobile. I feel nauseous when I move it.  I haven&#39;t seen this experience anywhere so I am puzzled... I&#39;m fully vaccinated w/ everything else and the closest to this was the tetanus shot, which hurt but not like - this - level of pain. I&#39;m getting a bit concerned that the person who did it (in a hundred car drive thru) missed the deltoid and shot it into my shoulder?? It&#39;s VERY high on my arm. I believe in this vax 100% but I can&#39;t believe the pain I&#39;m having and why it&#39;s not mentioned anywhere.  Like I am so so grateful for this vax and am in awe of the science -- and everyone should get it   -- but I just don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m in literal excruciating pain :( Moving it even slightly feel like I&#39;m ripping it from the bone.   It?s now been 20 hours and the pain is worse than ever, even breathing, sneezing or bending over causes searing pain.

                                                Anaphylaxis - Throat swelled almost completely closed, wheezing, lightheadedness (nearly passed out), throat/neck and injection site were very itchy and swollen, face/eyes swelled up, turned very pale all over, heart palpitations, etc. The next day - severe, horribly painful burning sensation all throughout my body.  Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

My hands became tingly/numb as well as my legs. This lasted about a half hour where I felt I could faint at any moment. My arm is currently sore 7 hours later and I am fatigued.

A 24-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 24-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did have COVID prior vaccination and the patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced delirium at night of given dose in the morning. The patient was not feverish, but she was mumbling unintelligibly, shaking uncontrollably and not recognizing family members. The patient received ibuprofen and acetaminophen as the treatment for the events. the outcome of events, delirium, mumbling unintelligibly, shaking uncontrollably and not recognizing family members was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between event delirium and BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 24-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 02Mar2021 08:30 (24-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications that the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6201) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 09Feb2021 08:30 (24-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Pins and needles/numbness in left leg through foot began about 3 hours after 2nd dose (from 02Mar2021 12:00). Extreme muscle tightness in left calf. Ultrasound done on calf came back negative. Full brain/spinal cord scan done to detect demyelination of nerves - MRI came back normal. EMG done on left leg to check for peripheral nerve damage - EMG came back normal. Almost 8 weeks post 2nd dose and still experiencing muscle weakness/fatigue and muscle spasms, specifically in legs through feet. Hands and feet &#34;fall asleep&#34;/go numb very frequently, even when the extremities are not restricted in any way. No medication or other treatment given for symptoms. Extremely heavy and painful menstrual cycle this month (1 month after 2nd vaccine, Apr2021), which is extremely abnormal for patient. Events were assessed as serious with criteria of Disabling/Incapacitating. Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of muscle weakness/fatigue and muscle spasms was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

Then 12 Hours after vaccine my arm became VERY sore, took my ibuprofen and alternated with Acetaminophen.  Then my face became very flushed (I used ice packs) and I got a mild sore throat. That night I had difficulty sleeping. I kept waking up with terrible body aches. About 24 hours after the vaccine I just had fatigue, mild fever, and chills. I slept on and off throughout the day and then started to feel better. But at about 32 hours post vaccine I started to feel worse. My headache and sore arm came back and I became very light headed and dizzy.

I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

                                                tingling reaction on her arms, body/tingling in the hands and arms; swelling of the face; headaches; she had numbness in the face and tingling; weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness; fatigue; in the back, she had pain, soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down; in the back, she had pain, soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down; she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days.; a bump on her forehead with a high temperature; a bump on her forehead with a high temperature/ it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer sponsored program. A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

This started on day 6 after the first dose and lasted a couple days. It was intense and tingling to the point of painful and hard to complete my job. I let my OB know because I am pregnant with due date of 7/22/2021 but they did not feel my symptoms could be pregnancy related. I did not seek further care from my primary care doctor because it subsided.

The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event &#34;feeling like she was going to vomit&#34; was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other reported serious events with BNT 162b2 can not be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

A 25-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 02Jan2021 11:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. The patient has no known allergies. The patient was not pregnant. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient got the vaccine Saturday, by 1500 her arm was very sore. Sunday morning her arm was so sore she could hardly move it the muscle was very tight and stiff. She was also very fatigued all day Sunday (03Jan2021) and slept most of the day, a fever of 100.5 developed. When she woke up Monday morning the fever was gone, fatigue was gone and the soreness in her arm felt like normal soreness after a vaccine such as the flu vaccine. Come Wednesday her arm was finally not sore anymore. The patient did not received treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered on Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

Felt like a globes sensation without itching or hives.   Nurses at vaccine site checked vitals multiple times. BP at start of symptoms 152/106, HR 140, O2 sat 99%. EMS was called but I did not feel symptoms were worsening, my lungs were clear without wheezing or stridor. I made the decision to not have EMS transport me to the ER. Symptoms improved so I decided to not go to the ER. Symptoms returned moderately for which I took 25 mg tab of Benadryl. As time progressed, symptoms waxed and waned, about 4 hours after the vaccine the globus sensation in the throat has improved, but there is a globs sensation in the lower esophagus, almost GERD-like in nature.

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

Took Ibuprofen 400mg still was feeling the numbness and took another Ibuprofen 200mg  around 1400 for the still felt slight numbness.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl around 1700 because I still was feeling the slight numbness on right side of face. In the morning was not noting any improvement in the facial numbness and was feeling that the cheek muscles were tighter on the right side and causing subtle facial asymmetry.  I got worried and went to the ED. I was assessed,  diagnosed with facial paresthesia.  I was offered an MRI, I declined as I did not feel that I needed it at the time. Provider prescribed 40 mg of prednisone daily for 5 days, valacyclovir 1000mg  3 times a day for 7 days. After starting prednisone facial muscle tightness I was feeling improved, still felt slight numbness more so in the mornings the next 2 days. I took the full course of prednisone, I am no longer feeling the facial symptoms. I stopped taking valacyclovir on day 3, since I felt that the prednisone was what is helping and it was harder to evenly take it 3 times a day.

                                                I was recently dx with early onset albeit mild carpal tunnel in both arms after a couple short numbness/tingling episodes over a period of several months. I started work at 6:45am today and suddenly noticed around 11:30am that if I bent my arms, rested on my elbows, or put any pressure against my elbows, that same numbness/tingling would shoot down my forearms and up my upper arms. I?ve never had this happen before and I have had no incident or added stress on/with my hands/wrists/arms. It?s almost as if the vaccine exacerbated this nerve issue. My entire body also aches but I was prepared for that possible side effect.

Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

She held her hand to calm down. gave her the vaccination and 5 mins later the patient said she has a headache, was upset, and started crying. She covered her eyes with her hands and started to shake. She also went to her bed and was rolling in it. The facility called 911 and they came within 5 mins. They did confirm that the patient wasn&#39;t having a seizure. Patient was calmed down but still went with the paramedics to be checked out. When I followed up with the facility, they said it was an anxiety event and the patient is back at the facility doing well. Let me know if you have any additional questions.

However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

I could not lift my right arm, I was exhausted doing everyday things.  Sunday- migraine wouldn?t go away. I got body chills but it wasn?t until later at night. And my body aches became moderate.  Monday- my migraine went down to a headache but my body aches wouldn?t go away. I did not take any pills. Throughout the day. I was tired. It was hard moving around. I was kind of sluggish but not as much as Tuesday. Tuesday- severe body aches. Both my arms hurt but I thought it was just due to laying in bed after getting home from work at 2:30 on Monday. Severe pain in my shoulders and middle of my back. I did some stretches thinking maybe my body was just sore from laying down. Went to bed at 12 because I couldn?t keep warm and my back was killing me.  Wednesday- horrible ache though out my back I got up to move but it hurt so much. I?m walking so slow. I need to rest on the walls because it hurts so much to move. My headache is still there. I took midol at 1:30pm;  did not do much. I?ve been trying to move about and stretch but my body does not allow me. Even typing hurts I cannot keep a good grip on things. My arms, entire left side of my back and many thighs  are in pain

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid, on 29Dec2020 at 18:40 (at the age of 25-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced broke out in hives all over her body on 03Jan2021, which was reported as medically significant. The patient also didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable and areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened on 03Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received her first dose of the vaccine on 29Dec2020 and said 5 days later she broke out in hives. The patient stated her hives began on the evening of 03Jan2021. She clarified she had hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable. She said she still had areas on her legs and ankles that were reddened. She said the reddened areas on her legs and ankles are not fully raised or itchy, like she had experienced with the hives on the rest of her body. The patient went to an urgent care on 06Jan2021. She saw a dermatologist for the hives on 07Jan2021, who suspected that since she did not have any prior history of hives, her hives are from the COVID-19 vaccine. She said the dermatologist told her there is no way to truly test if the vaccine caused her hives. The patient received an intramuscular unspecified steroid shot at the dermatologist and was prescribed methylprednisolone (MANUFACTURED BY: PAR PHARMACEUTICAL; Lot number: 1129091; Expiration date: Dec2021) 4 mg tablets in a taper dose pack. She also stated that she took the following over-the-counter medications: diphenhydramine hydrochloride (reported as: generic BENADRYL; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN; Lot number: 0MR0456; Expiration date: Sep2022) 25 mg tablet, taken as needed; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC; Lot number: 1652346; Expiration Date: Dec2021) 10 mg tablet, taken as one tablet up to four times a day; and hydrocortisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) cream. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all of the events as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of broke out in hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable was recovering and of areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

The patient did not receive any treatment from events. The outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported temporary mental fog/mental impairment was likely related to first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A week later on January 15 I started to itch from head to toe all over my body. On January 25 woke up with hives/rash that is on and off all over my body. I am still itchy and still occasionally have the rash. Have been to my pcp and a dermatologist and as of 1/9/21 they do not have a reason to how or why this happened.  Nothing in my daily life has changed soaps, detergent, food, drink, work gloves.

                                                I am a third-year medical student. Since receiving the second dose of the COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on Tuesday 2/2, I have had persistent and worsening muscle spasms of the torso. I presented to the Emergency room on 2/6 due to worsening symptoms and was admitted until 2/7. The neurology team evaluated my condition was not able to make a firm diagnosis. They believe the vaccine has caused a dystonic reaction. I was given benadryl 25mg to continue for one week q6 hours prn. However, benadryl has provided minimal relief. They also strongly recommended that I be seen by a movement disorder specialist at hospital ASAP.  However, due to the fact that I have insurance I am not covered for care from hospital. My insurance said they will review the referral which will take another 5-7 business days from today 2/9. As a medical student, I have had to miss one week of clinic rotations and will continue to miss vital medical training as well as my board exam this Friday due to my worsening symptoms. It has created such a negative impact on my life including pausing my medical training, and physically being incapable of driving or performing many of my basic daily activities. I live alone and near hospital. I am urgently requesting if there is anyway CDC can help me, a medical student who has put in her all to fight the pandemic alongside you.   I am extremely concerned about my symptoms and the panic that it has created for my family and friends. I hope that a rapid response can help me and my loved ones find some answers during these challenging times.

At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

My first dose of covid vaccine I had a tingling tongue and face and just took some Claritin and Pepcid. The second time around my entire mouth went numb and it felt like there was something in my throat. My airway was not impacted but it felt off. I was given 25mg of Benadryl and monitored for half an hour with vitals every 5 minutes. I?m 14 hours out from the reaction and I feel fine now.

However starting this weekend on 2/20/21, a week after the vaccine, my arm will occasionally throb and hurt in the same area that I received the injection. The pain and throbbing last for about 10 seconds and appear to occur at random. On a pain scale, I would say it&#39;s about a 3 out of 10. After the throbbing, I experience a general sense of discomfort in the area that lasts about an hour or two but that is no longer painful

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

                                                Within 1 hour of injection (10:00am), began experiencing fatigue that got increasingly worse. By 2:00pm, had slurred speech; severe fatigue; red skin on hands, face, neck; balance problems and dizziness; swollen hands. That evening through the next morning, I was experienced severe flu-like symptoms, including vertigo, extremely severe fatigue, and full-body muscle aches. My temperature was slightly elevated (98.7) from my &#34;baseline,&#34; which is around 96.7. On Saturday, I was very tired, no appetite, still experiencing some vertigo and muscle aches. Symptoms improved overnight and by Sunday evening, I was mostly back to normal, with some lingering fatigue.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Monday, March 15th around 9:30/10:00am I began to feel nauseous, had a headache, felt cold and overall tired. I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

                                                After 12 hours of getting the shot, I woke myself and my partner up from shaking so bad. I took some Benadryl to call the Nausea but I vomited everything in my stomach up by 1AM. I cannot sleep because of the fever (100.5 F) and I cannot eat anything without being sick

The nurse was very responsive and had me put my jacket on, zip it all the way up, and allowed me to lay down. She provided water and snacks. I was very dizzy for 5-10 minutes. The nurse helped me perform calming excecises, which helped a lot. I then slowly started to feel better. After about 30 minutes I was able to stand up and felt mostly normal. It has been 3 hours and I am only a little fatigued, but otherwise okay. I have not had any issues with shots in my adulthood, but as a child, I remember turning white and vomiting after a flu shot. So I may be subconsciously adverse to shots.

I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

Then, she complained of extreme muscle pains, all over; itching and shortness of breath with formation of mucus in her chest.  She has interstitial lung disease and is well aware of what mucus-filling in her chest (lungs) feels like.  She also had headache and coughing and this necessitated using Benadryl 50mg, her Xopenex rescue inhaler at the site; followed by contacting of her pulmonologist for future treatment and instructions.

                                                Swelling and redness of the arm within an hour after the vaccine. Tingling began in middle, ring, and pinky fingers within 20 minutes of injection. Numbness began within the first hour. Within two hours, I lost strength and 60% use of my left hand. The pinky and ring finger of my left hand have been either completely numb or tingling ever since my shot over one week ago.   I noticed mild numbness about 3-4 days after the first dose, but assumed I had just slept funny. When my arm became red and hand became tingly after my second dose, I realized this was an effect of the vaccine and not merely a pinched nerve in my sleep.
