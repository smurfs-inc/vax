                                                Summary: Syncopal espisodes x 2   16 yo patient received his Covid-19 vaccine and as he was going to sit down in observation, he leaned on his mom and passed out. His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                seizure like symptoms; Dizziness; lethargy; fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist.  A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of intramuscular BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Mar2021 at 12:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 16-year-old. Lot number was EN6205. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. On 02Mar2021 at 12:00, the patient experienced Dizziness, seizure like symptoms, lethargy, fatigue. It was unknown if the patient was treated due to the events. The patient recovered from the events in Mar2021. It was unknown if the patient had COVID prior vaccination; it was unknown if the patient was tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Seizure cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 17-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Apr2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EW1064) as SINGLE DOSE  (at age of 17 years old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included epilepsy (interactable epilepsy) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications.  Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1 on 25Mar2021 09:00, lot number as ER8733,  in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation(at age of 17 years old). On 17Apr2021, the patient experienced increased seizure activity, fatigue/tired, confusion and memory issues. After the 2nd shot, about 4-5 hours, he experienced increased seizure activity and it has progressed to today, today he is a little bit better but it has progressed to point he is having a lot of confusion and memory issues. He has several different types of seizures but he has what are called mini seizures, the blank stare, the confusion. Nothing has stopped completely, he isn&#39;t back to his baseline as far as his seizures. He always has seizures, daily so she is calling about the increased activity and when she says his baseline she means he has not returned back to his baseline activity, but he is doing better than yesterday.  Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were horrible. Today he started to get back to his normal self. The events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room or Physician Office. Outcome of the increased seizure activity/mini seizures, confusion and memory issues were recovering. Outcome of fatigue/tired were not recovered.

At further inspection I noticed that he was having a rash . I had a sit for a few more minutes then his mom came up and we noticed that his arm started to swell. We gave him 2 capsules Benadryl 25mg and instructed him to go to urgent care. Called for a follow up later in the evening and found that urgent care send him to the ER. The rash was spread all over and well as the swelling. He swelled all the way to his toes. He also tuned white and became very lightheaded at the ER. They gave him IV Benadryl and dexamethasone and was sent home. It has been recommended by the ER doctors to not get the 2nd dose.

The following morning he felt feverish and achy with malaise. He stayed home, drank fluids and rested and felt well enough to come up to ski this weekend.

All soreness subsided within 3 days.   Sudden sensitivity to light developed about 26 hours after the shot was given. This side effect remained for about 8 days afterwards and still has some very slight residual effect (now 12 days after).

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Apr2021 at 12:45 (Lot Number: Ew0153) at the age of 18 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism spectrum disorder, ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) combined, learning disabilities. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medication taken within two weeks of vaccination included alfetamine aspartate/alfetamine sulfate/dexamphetamine saccharate/dexamphetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for an unspecified indication. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 in left arm, on 02Apr2021, lot # EK5730. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Apr2021 at 21:00 the patient experienced extreme hallucinations, not feeling well, chills, aches and pains, headaches, slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, he did not get much sleep, fever. The clinical course of events was reported as follows: My son reported to me at bedtime last night, the night of his second Pfizer vaccine dose, that he was not feeling well. I told him to take some Advil and go to bed. He had a very bad night with chills and aches and pains but most distressing was his description of having had extreme hallucinations. He said that he was aware they were hallucinations and not real during and after the experience, but it was nonetheless concerning. It is also concerning that he didn&#39;t wake me for help. At any rate, he did not get much sleep and I have to assume his fever went pretty high before morning. He described to me the need to hydrate during the night. He also relayed to me this morning an experience of headaches and slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, but he is now feeling much better. He is dressed, has eaten, and is playing games on the computer. I am keeping a close eye on him today and should we return to that level of concern, we will take him to urgent care.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

                                                A little before bed I was feeling cold (I think it was a little after 10pm). I took a warm shower thinking the house was just cold, but when I went to bed after I started shaking with chills. I didn?t sleep well that night and during the day Thursday (01/21) I felt feverish and a throbbing headache. I tried sleeping throughout the day, still having the chills come and go. I took ibuprofen before heading the bed the next night and slept great other than feeling a little hot and sweaty. I showered the next morning and felt 100% again.

Vaccinator describes 20-30 seconds of full body shaking. Patient then awoke and was Alert and oriented to people, place and time within 2 minutes. He was nauseas and anxious initially. Onsite EMS was alerted immediately and came to access the patient. 911 was also called quickly under the assumption it may have been a seizure. Patient denied any seizure history. Father arrived a few hours later to pick up patients vehicle and dog. Father informed me that patient was doing better at this point and was being prepared for departure.

                                                Side effects manifested after second dose as a migrane in the early morning (~4:30 AM). Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

These spasms lasted until roughly 8am and were strong enough to rattle my 300lb bed frame. The only treatment I could think of at the time was to get as warm as I could so i covered myself in 8 blankets and just waited it out. It is now noon and the chills/spasms seem to be gone.

                                                Extreme Pain in both upper arms (elbow to shoulder) started just a few hours ago. It?s incredibly harsh, I am taking 600-900mg of Ibuprofen. I do not know if it is a possible tension from working at home and at a computer but I have only had that pain in my hands and lower arm and upper arm pain is new to me.

This 20-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number ER8731) on 14Apr2021 16:45 at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number ER8733) on 28Mar2021 12:00 in right arm. The patient had no Known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no COVID tested post vaccination. The patient had not received other vaccine in four weeks. On 15Apr2021 04:00, his body was involuntarily twitching and his teeth was opening and closing as if he was having a seizure. He thought it was because he was cold so he put on 3 layers of clothes and 2 bundles of blankets and turned the heat up, but his body was still shaking and he was still cold. He tried to go back to sleep to see if that would fix it, but it did not until he went to work and around 7:30 a.m., the shivering stopped, but the headaches persisted and he had to ask to go home and he received an occurrence because he did not have a doctor&#39;s note. He clocked out at 8 and he went to sleep for an hour in the car in the parking lot because he was in no condition to drive home. Treatment received for the events included Acetaminophen and rest. The outcome of teeth was opening and closing as if I was having a seizure, body was involuntarily twitching, was cold, shaking, was resolving. The outcome of shivering was resolved. The outcome of headaches was not resolved.

                                                When reviewing forms with patient the patient disclosed a shellfish allergy. He described the symptoms of his skin turning red, shaking, and swelling in his throat as swelling in the past. He indicated that he had needed to use an epi pen in the past for his allergy.  He still wanted the vaccination and knew we had an epi pen handy.  He was given the vaccination in his left arm and was set up next to the staff development employee who was timing and monitoring patient&#39;s for symptoms. An epi pen was given to the monitor so it would be handy.  The patient&#39;s right hand started shaking within a minute and it was hard to tell if it was from being anxious.  Patient continued to communicate verbally and stated he wanted to use the epi pen.  911 was called by the staff and the staff member with the epi pen took it and the patient out of the main area. Paramedics transported him to the hospital with slight tachycardia and never did administer epi pen while in facility. Patient was always conscious and able to verbally communicate.

                                                Symptoms started during bedtime and woke me up. Began with severe full body chills and full body muscle shaking and weakness during the night of 1/5 and early morning of 1/6, around 1000 to 0200. Slight headache began during that time as well.   Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

                                                I started feeling achy around 9:00 pm and felt like I was going to get more ill. I took some Tylenol in hopes it would help but it got worse throughout the night. During the night, I couldn?t hardly sleep due to feeling really hot and achy. I felt like I had a fever but did not have a thermometer to check it. When I woke up this morning, I noticed I had a knot on my clavicle which I believe it to be a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. I was unable to go to my internship today due to feeling ill but I am feeling better now after sleep and medication.

Multiple Hives (about 5)  formed on my arms and upper body. Took 50mg benadryl to manage. Was already on Zyrtec at the time in case of reaction.   Slight congestion and sinus irritation but no feeling of anaphylaxis or much in the throat.   Symtoms stopped worsening and were gone by the next day.

                                                At around 10 pm. I started feeling really cold. By 10:30 I had really bad chills. I tried to lay down and warm up but by chills were extreme by the time I got in bed. They were so bad that I couldn&#39;t even hold my phone or drink water without extra effort. Then as I tried to sleep I started to feel really hot. I eventually went to sleep but woke up about two hours later feeling like I had a fever. I was hot and sweaty. During the night I woke up every two hours feeling this way, hot, and tired. Then at 6 am I woke up still feeling bad, but better. Now I had a headache that wasn&#39;t there before. I drank a lot of water and took advil. After a cold shower I started to feel a lot better.

Patient sat down, had some water, and received ice packs placed on the neck.

Called patient to check in about 3 hours after event with no response.

When the pharmacist went to release him, he was pale, dizzy, and clammy. He stated that he did not feel good. The pharmacist fanned him to cool  him down. She also gave him a wet rag to wipe his forehead. He was given two teaspoonful of Benadryl 12.5mg/ 5ml. The patient stated that he was feeling dizzy and thought he was going to faint. The pharmacy called 911. The patient removed his jacket and mask as he was hot. The EMT arrived and walked him outside* I am not sure what happened after that

While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

                                                My arm felt sore for about a day and a half after receiving the vaccine. It was most comparable to the dull pain that I felt 1-2 weeks after breaking my arm. I had limited mobility due to the pain and the area around the vaccine hurt to touch. The pain gradually faded away after the first day and was completely gone by the end of the second day.

Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

Severity is moderate. Quality dull pain. Currently involves entire left arm (arm, elbow forearm wrist hand).. Did have some swelling and motor loss, NO CP, SOB or sensory loss, no redness, no injury, no fever, chills, ha, depression sore throat, cough, rash, lymphadenopathy, abd pain, GI distress, no trauma or recent illnesses. 2/21: admitted clinic w/rhabdomyolysis: no preceding workouts, increased activity on ship, back sleeper, no alcohol, no trauma,. nsp: skin intact, no erythema. Mild edema to upper arm around triceps. Mild purple discoloration to dorsum of hand. Palp: TTP about triceps. TTP anterior shoulder. TTP biceps. Able to palpate triceps tendon and biceps tendon. NTTP throughout the rest of hand and forearm. Hand is cooler relative to contralateral side. NTTP cervical spine. ROM: Full passive ROM of the shoulder and elbow with pain. No micromotion pain with any joint in the upper extremity. Painless cervical spine ROM. Motor: 3/5 strength to OP/FPL/2nd FDP, EIP/EPL, 1st and 2nd DIO. 3/5 deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors. Sens: Decreased sensation throughout entirety of forearm and hand distal to the elbow. Above the elbow, sensation is intact. Vasc: 2&#43; radial pulse, symmetric to contralateral side. BCR &lt;3 sec. Hand is cooler than contralateral side. Lab: CRP &lt;5, ESR 4, CK 31,924, PT 14, INR 1.1, D-dimer 0.46, AST 610, ALT 186, Cr 0.94, WBC 6.3 Imaging: Radiographs of the chest, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand demonstrate no fracture. The shoulder is well located. CTA starting at the heart demonstrate no vascular abnormalities. Assessment: unlikely that he has compartment syndrome or a cervical spine pathology. His exam does not localize to one specific innervation or muscle group. His paresthesias and diffuse 3/5 weakness on exam may be related to parsonage turner syndrome (post viral neuritis) versus edema. While he does have a cool hand and mild/moderate edema on exam, his CTA is normal and his exam is very reassuring that this is not compartment syndrome. He likely has rhabdomyolysis based on upper arm swelling in the setting of CK of 31924.   Discharge 2/22/2021: He received a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and was encouraged to drink large amounts of water. Repeat CK levels showed to be down trending as were his AST and ALT enzymes. Plain radiographs of his left arm and shoulder were unremarkable as was CT angiography of his chest. Electrolytes and renal lab work was within normal limits throughout the hospitalization.On the day of discharge, he was tolerating a PO diet, ambulating without difficulty, and hemodynamically stable. LUE w/ minimal swelling, no erythema. TTP over L triceps belly, No TTP over the distal LUE. Somewhat decreased sensation to light touch over distal LUE. 2&#43; radial pulses b/l. LUE ROM somewhat limited 2/2 pain, but intact. ---- to f/u with HCP in 2 weeks, sooner if worse (medical officer)   CK 2/22/21 was down to 14653

                                                Got woken up by intense leg pain around 6:00am the day following vaccination. I took 1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen (split between 2 pills each containing 500mg methocarbamol and 200mg ibuprofen), and 1000mg acetaminophen before a hot bath which relieved pain enough to get back to sleep around 7am. I woke up again around 11am with similar extreme pain, took another set of  1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen , and 1000mg acetaminophen along with 5mg of hydrocodone left over from recent dental work. Pain subsided  until approximately 4:00pm when legs started to hurt again before getting to severe levels around 5pm (and so did the back of my neck which was the first neck pain experienced) so I took another set of 1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen , and 1000mg acetaminophen along with 5mg of hydrocodone  (which has helped ease discomfort again).   Leg pain is not sharp but very persistent and painful and is located behind both knees.  Neck pain was sharp and located directly at the back. I have had no arm pain or injection site swelling or pain, just leg pain and neck.   I did not experience any side-effects after my first dose, not even injection site pain.

I hear peoples voices in that buzz noise under their normal voice, almost like robotic. I don&#39;t know if this is related to the vaccine or not but I did notice it start the day after I got vaccinated.

For the next 12 hours, had hot and cold flashes, along with strong headaches. Nausea when standing or moving quickly. Likely fever. Nighttime acetaminophen taken at about 6 am. By 2 pm the next day, able to stand. Nausea gone, and hot and cold flashes not as bad (but still present). Appetite was poor. Regular acetaminophen taken at around 2 pm. By end of Saturday (10 pm), headache and chill/heat, but to a lesser degree. Nighttime acetaminophen taken at 10pm or so. Next day, Sunday, most symptoms were gone, except for join pains. Neck in particular was sore when head was tilted at all. Monday, all symptoms gone. Maybe some minor soreness.

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

                                                On Saturday night (4/10) I had some chest pains that seemed to not go away in my upper left chest and left arm. I tried to sleep it off until the pain was unbearable at around 7:00 am on Monday (4/11). I then admitted myself to the ER and was given an ECG and multiple EKG?s as well. Upon lab results I had high triponin levels (28) leading the doctors to believe I had a heard attack of some sort, eventually they ruled it as acute pericarditis possibly due to my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

A 24-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Jan2021 at 11:30am on left arm, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL0140) at right arm on 20Dec2020 10:30am for COVID-19 immunization. On 08Jan2021 at 12:00pm, the patient experienced facial droop 2 days after taking the 2nd dose of the vaccine. The patient went to the hospital for doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care and were advised to take Valtrex and Prednisone and told its Bell&#39;s palsy. Bell&#39;s palsy onset within 48 hours of second vaccine, R side of face. Wanted to confirm if there will be a problem once they take these drugs since the paient have just received the vaccine recently or wanted to know if the new medications prescribed will affect the vaccine&#39;s effectivity. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Facial droop/ Bell&#39;s palsy occurred 2 days after taking the 2nd dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine, a possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the event onset thus might not be fully excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

I waited for 30 minutes and was perfectly fine.  Around 5 pm I started to feel symptoms.  I got the worst aches in my entire body i&#39;ve ever felt before, along with chills.  I felt extremely hot, I took my temperature and had a fever of 102.3.  I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseas .  My head was throbbing.  I ended up taking 1000mg of tylenol to help reduce the fever, which seemed to really help.  I fell asleep and woke up the next morning drenched in sweat.  My fever was gone, but I still had a horrible headache and threw up from the nausea I was having.  It felt like I had a horrible hangover.

                                                Slight shoulder pain around injection sight; Mild discomfort; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 24-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EK4176; Expiration date was not reported) on 22Jan2021 (10:15) at a single dose, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Jan2021 (12:30), the patient had slight shoulder pain around the injection &#34;sight&#34; (site) and mild discomfort. The pain around the injection site had lasted roughly 48 hours, and then was getting more painful over time, then slowly getting better. The patient did not receive any treatment for the reported events. The outcome of the events, pain around the injection site and discomfort, was recovered in Jan2021. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination, and had not been tested since the vaccination.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

                                                platelets completely crashed; arm got a little sore; felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms; felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (reporting on himself). A 24-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection, lot number: SH1555218 and expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 21Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing 22Q (diagnosed with this condition when he was about 4 years old). Immunodeficiency from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included rituximab (RITUXAN) taken for immunodeficiency, start and stop date were not reported. Patient states he received the 1st dose on 21Mar2021 about 9:00am or a little before that time and had a very bad side effect and was in the hospital for a couple of days. His weight was 162 or 163 pounds. Patient was immunocompromised and has issues regarding that lately and received Rituximab which is like a chemo; states after he had the Pfizer Vaccine on 21Mar2021, his arm that the vaccine was administered into got a little sore relatively soon after the shot and the main thing he was reporting that his platelets completely crashed which was the reason for the hospitalization (from 24Mar2021 to 26Mar2021). Patient states for the Rituximab he gets due to having some issues being immunocompromised, it was his 4th treatment with the Rituximab and states he has no lot numbers, dosages, expiry dates or NDC numbers to provide and states he was on the Rituximab for his immunocompromised status. His arm soreness was in the same arm that he had the Pfizer vaccine administered into and would say the following day after getting the Pfizer vaccine, he felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms that resolved completely like 2 days later and these symptoms went away. Patient was immunocompromised and has fairly serious health issues since he was age 4-5 and was able to get the vaccine with his HCP. Rituxan was the only medication he can think of to include in this report. Patient did not require a visit to the emergency room or the HCP office but was actually just getting the last dose of his treatment with Rituxan and then they drew his labs and the labs stated his platelet count had completely crashed the last time they checked his lab work. His platelet count was 3000 on 26Mar2021 and the platelets went up relatively quickly after that. Patient did not have treatment other than just the steroid of the very high dose Dexamethasone. Patient would like Pfizer&#39;s opinion and was not entirely sure he can get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and was asking what was recommended; patient aware that Pfizer was unable to offer medical advice or treatment recommendations and was referred to his HCP. Patient still on steroids very high dose Dexamethasone and got IVIG in the hospital; states he has no lot numbers, expiry dates, dosages or NDC numbers for the Dexamethasone or IVIG to provide. He has his patient card for the Pfizer Vaccine and states for the lot number, he thinks it was SH1555218 but does not locate other information including other numbers that could be the lot or the expiry date or the NDC number; states the patient card information was not handwritten and he can&#39;t tell what the lot number was and states this information was embedded like a bar code on his patient card. The outcome for the events platelets completely crashed, arm got a little sore was unknown and for events felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms was recovered on 24Mar2021.

I slept for a long time and woke up the following day with the standard arm pain but I also had extreme fatigue and a headache as well as a productive cough. That lasted for over 48 hours. On the third day I had fatigue, cough, body aches and a headache. I received a rapid  covid test on the 31st that was negative and the nurse practitioner said that she believed that I was either having a bad reaction to the vaccine or bronchitis or pneumonia. Last night I had all of the same symptoms as days prior as well as tightness in my chest and a obvious upper respiratory infection.&#34;

                                                I received the 2nd dose of my Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 01/25/2021 at ~7:30am, at around 2:00pm I noticed I had generalized fatigue, a general sense of feeling cold, and the muscles in the back of my neck were sore, which was causing a tension-like headache. The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day of first pfizer vaccine (3/18/21), i woke up from a nap and my back hurt so bad that i couldn&#39;t leave the bed without falling out. My parents came and helped me out and gave me painkillers but really nothing helped. Next day, it started down my right arm (the arm NOT injected with the shot) and it started to hurt in my muscles everywhere and hasn&#39;t stopped to this day (3/25/21). Numbness and pins and needles feeling have occurred in my pinky and ring finger of right arm. Pain has now started in my knees as well after a few days from the shot. No pain killers work and I&#39;m unable to write or type properly, or even work at my job frankly. I can&#39;t hold an object without it falling out of my hand, and when i am able to hold something, after about 2 seconds pain fills my arm. Nothing helps the pain. I saw my primary care physician on 3/25/21 and the PA said there wasn&#39;t anything to do for the intense pain i was having except take tylenol arthritis, melatonin (to help me sleep through the pain), exercise (even though it may cause me even worse pain), and a stress ball for my arm. I don&#39;t know what else to do with this pain and this was only the first round of shots.
