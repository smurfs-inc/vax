His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                seizure like symptoms; Dizziness; lethargy; fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist.  A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of intramuscular BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Mar2021 at 12:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 16-year-old. Lot number was EN6205. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. On 02Mar2021 at 12:00, the patient experienced Dizziness, seizure like symptoms, lethargy, fatigue. It was unknown if the patient was treated due to the events. The patient recovered from the events in Mar2021. It was unknown if the patient had COVID prior vaccination; it was unknown if the patient was tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Seizure cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                Patient received vaccine and went to sit down in front of pharmacy. He then immediately started feeling lightheaded, his eyes rolled into the back of this head and he had a couple of convulsion. He did not lose consciousness and was immediately aware. He was pale, lips were blue tinged, pulse was 60, sweating and blood pressure was 98/50. Paramedics were called but he had recovered by the time they got there. They said he had a fainting episode due to the vaccination and did not have a seizure. The patient had not eaten anything  the whole day and he felt that contributed.

                                                Patient was nervous upon receipt of vaccine.  It was an unscheduled (expiring) dose.  Per parent, he had fallen asleep outside vaccine room and they had to wake him up to get vaccine.   I gave immunization and asked him to stay for 15 minutes afterwards.  His Mom ran to consult window to notify staff patient was passing out.  I was sanitizing vaccine room so I immediately ran to him and his Dad and I caught him as he was slumping over.  He was shaking really hard, weak, and clammy.  He was coherent b/c I asked him his name but did not have clear recollection of timing of vaccine.  He was very pale in color.  His Mom grabbed him a Gatorade and he seemed very thirsty as he was drinking.  He mentioned he felt dizzy and that both arms were hurting and the arm I gave vaccine in felt like he had sweat dripping off it.  (I felt his arm and it did not).  I grabbed an instant cold pack and placed on his neck to help cool him off.  His color returned over the 30 minutes.  I asked parents if they wanted me to call ambulance but they wanted to wait and see how he responded.  He looked at his iPhone data and his heart rate had spiked.  Unclear if right before vaccine or right after but I believe he mentioned it went up to 120 when Mom said his normal resting heart rate was 60.  He ate some gold fish and seemed to perk up and have a few funny conversations showing his personality.  I explained to him very important to let parents know if he experienced any other side effects after leaving.  He was able to stand up and walk out of RX with parents.

                                                Patient felt dizzy, hot and light headed immediately following vaccination. He lied on the floor for about 5 minutes and had some water. He sat up since he was feeling better. He then became nauseated and lied back down. After another 5 minutes he was feeling better. He slowly went from lying to standing to walking. He sat outside for another 5 minutes and felt back to normal.

After mom was vaccinated I had my bad to the patient and his mom throwing away supplies, Pt passed out and was not responsive to mom or to myself the pharmacist. I thought the patient needed an EpiPen and went to get the EpiPen out of the pharmacy and while my back was turned mom stated that the patient convulsed a few times. By the time I returned with the EpiPen pt was not convulsing and had passed out and started to recover and become responsive. Pt was pale but was aware of his name, birthday, date, and current president. A tech called EMS. Pt was talking when EMS arrived and color had started to return to normal. pt was able to walk out to the ambalance to be checked out. Mom stated she wanted to take pt to ER for more evaluation.

His hands were clammy. He said he felt like his body was numb. We had him remove his mask and got him some water. He never actually lost consciousness. Eventually we had him lay down and put his feet up. His father was contacted and came to pick him up. We spoke to his mom later and she said he was feeling much better.

                                                Patient started to feel dizzy for about one minute. His father states that patient was sitting up on a chair and he started to fall backward, so his father caught him and lowered him to the ground. He did not hit his head. He was not responsive for approximately 10 seconds, per the father. Clinical monitors arrived and patient was alert and oriented to name, place, date/time. He was slightly pale and clammy but he denied any dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, changes in his vision/hearing, or nausea.  He was laying on his back on the ground with his legs elevated on a chair and he started to feel better, and his blood pressure and oxygen saturation were stable with mild bradycardia per the vital signs obtained by one RN. He said he was feeling better and he was smiling and joking with staff. He slowly started to sit up and sipped bottled water. Stated that he had not eaten since 11am, and he agreed to a snack.  I left to get him a snack, and RN said that he started to &#34;zone out&#34; and he lost consciousness again for approximately 20 seconds. When I came back, he was sitting up, conscious, and had spit up saliva and water onto his shirt. His breathing was steady.   He again stated that he was feeling better very quickly, again in good spirits, but his father and I agreed that it would be best to call 911 to transport him to the ER just to be safe. He did not hit his head. He denied dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, changes in vision,  and headache. He was alert and oriented to name, place, and time. EMS was requested and they arrived, took his vitals, and he was transported to the Emergency Dept for futher care.   He and his father were confident that he would recover quickly as he had a history of syncopal episodes related to vaccines in the past.

A 16-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 16Apr2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 16-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mental illness and autism from unspecified dates and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2, administered in right arm on Mar2021 (Lot number was unknown), at the age of 16 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no other vaccines in four weeks. Several hours after receiving the second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 16Apr2021 20:00, the individual developed a headache and took ibuprofen (ADVIL) and water. About an hour later, he was disoriented and the parent (who was a nurse practitioner) asked him questions and he was having a hard time answering. Patient&#39;s fever was over 103 in the ambulance. He was tested for everything at the hospital and all was negative. It was determined to be an adverse reaction to the vaccine and what likely happened is his temperature spiked so quickly that he had a seizure. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment for other adverse events was unknown. There was no COVID prior vaccination and patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about lot/batch has been requested.

                                                Patient came into the immunization room for his shot along with his mom. He did state he hated needles, but was in good spirits. He got the shot, I filled out his card, and directed him and his mom to sit in the waiting area for 15 mins in case of dizziness or a reaction. They were walking out of the room to the waiting area and he almost immediately fainted. He fell and possibly hit his head on the chair/ floor when he went down. (This was maybe 2 mins post-injection). He almost looked like he was going to have a seizure (arms were tensed up, his eyes were not focused, was starting to shake) but then he suddenly came-to. He seemed to be pretty coherent after he woke back up but 911 was called since he was bleeding

Still has difficulty focusing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father). A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: ER2613 and expiry: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 31Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccination was taken because he was going back to school. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EN6199, Expiry: Jun2021) on 10Mar2021 at 13:30 in right arm (at the age of 16-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and experienced loss of taste and smell and joint pain, all events started in Mar2021. Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation. Family Medical History included Sarcoidosis with mother. Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm at 17:30, tiredness at 20:30, shortness of breath, headache at 22:30 and muscle pain at 22:30. On 01Apr2021, the patient experienced fever at 00:30, chills at 01:30, redness at 02:30, leg pain at 08:30, fatigue (ongoing) at 02:30, joint pain at 08:30, too sick to get out of bed and passed out and hit the floor, put a big bump on his head at 05:30 (about 15 hours after second dose, patient was at the kitchen table with his head between his knees trying to breathe, passed out, hit the floor and put a big bump on his head). On 02Apr2021, the patient experienced brain fog at 14:30, swelling at 14:30, swollen glands at 02:30, loss of taste and smell to some extent at 14:30 and too sick to get out of bed. On day 2 (02Apr2021) and was still about pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit and on 21Apr2021 (after 21 days) sometimes over sometimes less. On the following Monday (05Apr2021), he struggled back to school after 5 days, but came home early. He has just been trashed, too trashed to train for his sport, further described as too weak to train, he hadn&#39;t trained for 3 weeks. He still has a fever. His local doctor did not have any suggestions other than he should take acetaminophen and ibuprofen alternately to get rid of the headache and fever. In 2021, the patient experienced 2-inch diameter raised circle at injection site and disappeared after 10 days and there was a time he could not barely remember his name, tried to study but just wasn&#39;t there, head on desk. Still has difficulty focusing and doing his calculus. It was reported that the time to recover from any exertion seems to be longer by a lot. On 01Apr2021, body temperature reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient tried to do a few things like a week ago just because he couldn&#39;t stand to be in the house anymore he took a bike out for about 15 minutes and was just trashed from that experience and took 3 days to recover. The events did not require emergency room visit nor physician&#39;s office neither hospitalized. The outcome was recovered from loss of consciousness, head injury on 01Apr2021; from illness on 02Apr2021; from headache on 04Apr2021; from chills on 06Apr2021; from pain in arm and fatigue on 07Apr2021; from erythema on 11Apr2021; from ageusia and anosmia on 14Apr2021; from lymphadenopathy on 16Apr2021; from arthralgia on 17Apr2021; from myalgia on 18Apr2021; from leg pain on 21Apr2021; from vaccination site swelling in 2021; then recovered with sequel from dyspnoea on 05Apr2021 and from swelling on 07Apr2021; then recovering from pyrexia, feeling abnormal; then not recovered from asthenia and unknown for the remaining events.

His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted. The fever spike was too fast, and his body couldn&#39;t handle it. His extreme nausea persisted for four hours (but he didn&#39;t vomit). He was completely debilitated. Fever spiked to 103 but stabilized at 102 for the following 24 hrs.

A 16-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: ER8736), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Apr2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 16-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were none. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 23Apr2021 at 09:45 (reported as 13 minutes after the vaccine), the patient said he was lightheaded and then fell out of the chair and hit the floor. He started making a gurgling/growling sound. After the nurses flipped him over, they noted that his right arm was contracted and tight. They were unable to determine if he had passed out or had a seizure. He had no seizure history. He regained consciousness after about 45 seconds to a minute. The patient was not treated for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The clinical outcome of passed out was resolved on 23Apr2021, while of seizure, lightheaded, fell out of chair and hit floor, making a gurgling/growling sound, his right arm was contracted and tight was resolving.

                                                Patient received his 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine on Tuesday 4/27/2021; he had low grade fever (100.3 deg F) on Wed 4/28/2021. On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

                                                Patient was given first dose and was in waiting area for observation.  About ten minutes after his shot our vaccine coordinator alerted me that he was having a reaction. When I went out to the patient his eyes were open but he was staring blankly. His father was shaking him and waving his hand in front of his face and asking him if he was okay and the patient was not responding. I also tried to get the patient to respond and he did not. Since the patient was not responsive to any questions we called 911. While waiting on the paramedics to arrive the patient came around and started to answer some simple questions. He was clammy and sweating and he threw up one time. When the paramedics arrived they took over. They checked all the patients vital signs  and were with him for about 15 or 20 minutes assessing him. The patient walked out of the store on his own and was not taken by ambulance.   I called the patient around 3:10pm to check on him and I spoke with him and he said he was doing fine.

Patient was sitting in the living room around 2030-2045 when he developed midsternal and epigastric region pain. Pain radiated to his upper middle back and down both left and right arms. There were no notable exacerbating or relieving factors. Pain was a 4-7 in severity. He was also nauseated. He was given tums by his mother without significant change in symptoms. After 45 minutes they decided to go to the ER. At ER labs were notable for elevated troponin (2-- &gt;15-- &gt;9). EKG with J-point elevation. Non-contrast CT chest/abd/pelvis was unremarkable. He was given ASA 325 and famotidine in the ED. Pain eventually subsided around 2345. He was transferred to another hospital for further evaluation of troponinemia.

One day prior to admission patient received his second COVID vaccine, Pfizer brand.  On the day of admission Patient woke at 0200 with pain in the left side of the chest, mid-axillary per patient&#39;s description it was cramp-like pain and he was able to go back to sleep.  At 0500 he got up to use the restroom and went into the kitchen.  He told his mom he didn&#39;t feel well and fell forward making a gurgling sound, arms rigid, was unresponsive, and this lasted 1.5minutes according to mom.

                                                Started with sore arm and headache, progressed to high fever (101). Next day had sores on mouth, which spread all over lips and started sore throat. Fever did not go away without medication. Medication would alleviate it but it continued for 6 days, reaching 102.4.  Pediatrician tested for strep and for COVID, both were negative.  Sore throat persisted after fevers subsided.  Had to finally be prescribed magic mouthwash. Doctor said sores on lips were herpes so prescribed viral medications.  My son never has a sore throat and has never had a herpes sore until after the shot.

We put the patient flat on the ground to protect from a fall injury and his seizing stopped. His color was very ashy and he was not responding properly to questions we asked.  In about 2 minutes, he became more coherent and began talking  and responding to our questions. Paramedics were immediately called and they arrived 30 minutes later after 3 phone calls to follow up.  Father was with patient.

                                                Patient was given Pfizer Vaccine on 5/16/21 at 11:00-11:10am.  I read through the patient medical history through the handheld and noticed there was &#34;yes&#34; on seizure history.  I ask the mother what happened and she told me it was from the first incident with the Pfizer vaccine.  At the time of the first incident the mother stated that patient fainted and convulsed upon regaining consciousness.  Patient has had no history of seizures prior to then or had any big injuries that could trigger it.  Patient&#39;s mother states physicians think it&#39;s triggered by anxiety and not a true seizure, so MRI or tests was not needed.  Doctor recommended patient to come back if it happens again.  With the information provided I used professional judgement and was on high alert with the patient.               After administrating the vaccine to the patient, I monitored patient&#39;s vitals carefully. Patient was stable and I walked with him to his seat near the wall and left him with his family.  About a few minutes later the mother told me to come to her aid.  Patient had a 1 time continuous seizure for about 30 seconds-1minute.  After regaining consciousness the patient said he did not remember getting the vaccine. Patient&#39;s mother was very concerned and under control and did not overreact to the situation.  Also, I promptly relayed to (pharmacist) to call 911 and he called a member of management.  While pharmacist was on the phone with 911 the patient regained consciousness.  I monitored patient&#39;s vitals while I waited for a member of store management.  Store management took a little bit longer to respond (5-10 minutes) but arrived to document the whole incident.               About 30 minutes after the incident patient&#39;s vitals were stable and the ambulance was not needed and the family took him to the hospital to get monitored. Patient rode the electric wheelchair was escorted out by store management to the car.

This lasted about a minute or so. He was finally able to say that he felt ok, but asked what happened. This happened a second time about 4minutes after the first time. But didn&#39;t seem to last as long. I gave him some juice and saw that his blood sugar was dropping to 85. Then a few minutes later his blood sugar was at 62. He continued to drink the juice and had 3 4carb glucose tablets. He started to feel better about 15 minutes later. He states that he felt numbness in his hands and feet initially. All feelings returned and color to his face and lips. His blood sugar began to rise again and he was feeling better. No hives or rash was noted on his body and the injection site was normal.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old male presenting to hospital as a transfer for chest pain and elevated Troponin levels concerning for myocarditis. Patient has otherwise been healthy. Two days ago he received his second dose of COVID vaccination. He initially felt fine, but later that day had some body aches. The next day he felt feverish off and on and had dull left upper sternal border chest pain intermittently. Today, he reports sharp 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, lightheadedness, sweating, chills, and intermittent non-productive cough. He presented to original hospital for evaluation. The patient admits to tactile warmth since Sunday with no documented temperatures. He recently received his second dose of Pfizer just before onset of these symptoms. He reports difficulty sleeping since Sunday, but no shortness of breath, rashes, syncope, nausea, or vomiting. He has not had any other recent illness, fevers, or known COVID-19 exposures. He denies any history of prior cardiac disease and there is no known family history of cardiac disease, arrhythmias, or sudden death in the child or adolescent period. He denies illicit or recreational drug use. In the ED, he was well appearing with pain now 1 out of 10. POC troponin was 16.8 ng/mL. He had labs pertinent for ESR 10, CRP 3.0, BNP 24. RP2 PCR was negative. UDS was negative except for opiates (s/p morphine). IV was placed and patient was started on IV fluids. EKG was obtained and showed questionable left atrial enlargement per ED read. Cardiology was consulted and performed Echocardiogram in the ED at bedside and was within normal limits. Cardiology resident team contacted for admission. Past Medical History: No major medical diagnoses Past Surgical History: Orchiopexy, T&amp;A Family History: No cardiac family history Social History: Lives at home with mother. Has two healthy siblings not living at home Immunizations: Up to date Medications: None Allergies: NKDA Etiology of likely myocarditis remains unclear at this time. In his age group, this would most likely represent a viral myocarditis. He would likely benefit from cardiac MRI during this admission for further evaluation of myocarditis. His EKG findings with his age group are unlikely to be secondary to myocardial infarct. No arrhythmias or heart block noted on EKG at time of admission or telemetry in ED. There is no family history of autoimmune disease or cardiac disease to suggest an autoimmune component or genetic etiology.

They presented to urgent care 1 week after the vaccine and was told that it was likely due to the vaccine, he had fluid in his ears and he was prescribed an antihistamine. He went back to urgent care a few days later and saw the same NP who told them to go to their PCP. At their PCPs office he tested &#34;faintly positive for Flu A&#34; and was given tamiflu and zofran which has since completed.   No bruising, bleeding, gum bleeding, nose bleeds. He has been having leg pain/difficulty walking and his friends brought him a cane to use. He has had possible night sweats, mom reports he &#34;burns up constantly.&#34; Decreased appetite, lost 4lbs, hasn&#39;t eaten much since last week.   Labs were performed at the PCPs office on 4/28/2021: WBC 1.7 Hgb 10.3 Hct 30.1 Plts 118K ANC 500   Mono was negative.   A referral was placed to our office on 5/4/2021 and he was brought to our clinic today for evaluation.

He was really weak and extremely tired. These symptoms last thur 06/04/2021 and his fever broke. I thought we was out of the woods. Saturday, Jun 05, 2021 he woke up with severe chest pains. He had an irregular heartbeat and rapid heart beat. He fever was back and it was 100.8.  I called his PCP  and he said to take him to the ER.

                                                Patient had the normal expected symptoms on the 2nd day following his shot ... with sore arm, fever to 101, fatigue &amp; slight headache. He refused to take Tylenol that day, unlike his 14 year sister who had the same symptoms. On Sunday morning (the 3rd day) he woke up &amp; told us he was having chest pain &amp; shortness of breath. His sister was doing fine. So I gave him Tylenol at 10am to try to reduce any inflammation &amp; he still had a fever of 100. About an hour later his fever had reduced to 99 but he was still having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath ... mainly if he walked or moved around. He didn?t want to get it checked out but I called our insurance &amp; they agreed that he should go to the ER for testing so we went there at around 3pm. He had testing done including EKG, chest X-ray &amp; COVID-19 test which all came back negative &amp; other lab tests that also came back negative.  They gave him some meds &amp; about 2 1/2 hours later diagnosed him with pleurisy.  He still was having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath when we left at 5:30pm but throughout the evening was getting better. We gave him Motrin before bed &amp; another Motrin this morning before school, even though he said he was feeling better.

                                                Patient had a sore arm but no fever on the day the vaccine was given. The following day (4/29/2021) patient was on a boat, in the sun, not drinking much water and noticed brown discoloration of urine. He drank more fluids and symptoms resolved. Patient received second COVID vaccine on 5/19/2021 and the following day (5/20/2021) he was again on a boat and in the sun all day long and noticed brown discoloration of his urine which resolved with increasing his fluid intake. On 6/2/2021, he noticed brown discoloration again that progressed to bright red blood in urine. Patient was seen in my clinic and labs showed acute kidney injury, hematuria, proteinuria, possible glomerulonephritis and/or acute tubular necrosis. He is being followed closely by Pediatric Nephrology now to monitor symptoms and will repeat labs to see if kidney function, hematuria, proteinuria has resolved. If it has not resolved, then he may need a renal biopsy to confirm diagnosis.

A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15May2021 (Lot Number: EW0177, at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart murmur. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical Vaccine included 2 vaccines in Mar2021 (Caller said that her son had 2 vaccines in Mar2021 on his annual doctor visit, she did not have the names of the vaccines and then had a booster for the vaccine 4 weeks later. The booster was 14 days prior to receiving the Covid vaccine), and meningococcal vaccine on 01May2021 (at the age of 16-year-old, Caller said that it was a meningococcal vaccine. She thought there were 2 different meningococcal vaccines). Caller was a consumer that was calling on behalf of her son that received his first dose of the Covid-19 Vaccine. She said that she saw on the news recently that Pfizer was looking into reports that teenagers were developing heart issues after receiving the vaccine. The caller said that her son was 16 years old and received his first dose on 15May2021. The caller said that her son had a really small heart murmur. When they got home later that day after he received the vaccine on 15May2021, he said that he had chest pain. She said that he did not have a fever, but was very fatigued and very sluggish for a couple of days. She said that this had been on her mind since she saw it on the news. She was concerned if he should get the second dose on 05Jun2021 with his pediatrician. The caller also said that because he turned 16 in Mar2021, he recently had 2 other vaccines and he had a booster. So he had 3 shots prior to having the Covid-19 Vaccine. The caller said that he received the Covid-19 Vaccine after 14 days of receiving the booster. The caller said that the fatigue and feeling sluggish lasted a couple of days, but stated that he was still tired a lot. The caller said that her son also reported that he had a sore arm. She said that he noticed it a couple of hours after his vaccination and lasted about 3 days. He had completely recovered from the sore arm. The outcome of the event chest pain was unknown, of event fatigue was not recovered, of event sluggish was recovering, of the event sore arm was recovered on 18May2021.

                                                The day following the second Pfizer shot the patient developed a fever to 101.5 that improved with Tylenol and did not recur.  On that same day he felt tingling in the hands and feet and reported a floating sensation.  This too resolved with resolution of fever.  On the third day after the shot he developed chest pain, difficulty taking a deep breath.  He woke up the following morning with nausea which resolved but the chest pain and a feeling that it was hard to take a deep breath worsened.  The pain was significant enough that he went to the ER.  In the ER, he was found to have an ECG consistent with acute pericarditis and his troponin was elevated (2.75, upper limits of normal 0.03).  He was started on IV Toradol and admitted to the hospital.  His troponin kept climbing so he was also given IVIG (80 gm).  The following morning his Troponin started coming down and he no longer was reporting any symptoms.

                                                Pain in the back of patient&#39;s right calf started after a flight on 6/2/2021.  We ended up in the ER on 6/7/2021.  There he was diagnosed per ultrasound with DVT or having a blood clot in a vein in his right calf.  He was prescribed Eliquis and counseled to follow up with his physician at home. Patient met with our family physician on 6/9/2021, the day we arrived home to follow-up.  After receiving the medical records Dr. advised us to file this report.  We understand that blood clots can happen on flights, but Dr. felt that this event was such an anomally for patient that it merited further reporting. Patient is a completely healthy 16 year old male who is an extremely active athlete who participates in basketball, track, cross-country and other physical activities daily.  For him to develop a blood clot after a 4 hour flight is an exceptional, unexpected event.  Dr. long term plan is to keep patient on Eliquis for 6 months, then take him off of the medicine and then run more blood tests after 2 weeks to fully investigate the incident.

Headache, mild aching in the arms and legs, lack of desire to eat, and extreme tiredness also. Inflammation of the lining of the heart was the primary side effect and very concerning. Pain began the day after the immunization.  It was significantly worse in the morning and mid-day.  Pain would lessen during the day, but increase over night again. Most symptoms were gone within 5 days.  Minor aches remain after 1 week.

                                                Exactly seven days after patient second vaccine, he boarded a 9:10AM flight, with his Dad and sister. Approximately 90 minutes into the flight, as patient watched a movie on his phone (which did not have a photosensitivity warning), he blacked out and doesn&#39;t remember anything else until after coming out of a seizure. What others saw, including his father (my husband), was a convulsing 16 year-old (nearly 6&#39; tall and 155 pounds), who was sitting just in front of him, between two strangers. My husband quickly realized what was happening and was totally surprised and struck with some fear, as we have NEVER seen a seizure in our family or in patient before (we have six biological children). The airline called for medical help; a doctor and some other professionals came. My husband had EMT training many years ago, so didn&#39;t hold patient body, but did work a few times to keep his head up (patient was seated), so as not to allow the airway to close. Patient sister (age 18) was across the aisle, alone, watching all of the commotion take place, not knowing what to do or how to help, in tears, but handling it with poise and independence. After about 2-3 minutes, the intense convulsing stopped, and his seizure became quieter but still had movement. His eyes were rolled back and he was foaming a bit at the mouth. He was still not responsive. This went on for about 4-5 minutes. Then he stopped. His dad and the doctor asked him basic questions like, &#34;who are you?&#34; &#34;how old are you?&#34; &#34;where are you?&#34; He couldn&#39;t answer any other those. Another 3-5 minutes past, and finally he was able to answer &#34;where are you?&#34; with &#34;I&#39;m right here.&#34; Slowly, he came back to his &#34;senses&#34; but of course, was very tired and had a horrible headache afterward. The doctor and my husband decided it was best to have the plane divert to another city  to get patient to a hospital as soon as possible. The three of them had to cancel their trip (work trip for my husband, which our 18- and 16-year-old children were accompanying him on for pleasure and travel). The Airlines was awesome about the whole thing. When the plane landed, they quickly escorted the three off the plane (patient walked slowly, then was put in a wheelchair when they got right off the plane). They were then transferred into an Ambulance and emergently sent to the Hospital. After several hours of waiting and testing, and patient not having any more seizure activity, his CT scan, blood tests, and chest x-ray were normal,  so he was discharged with the instruction to get an MRI with and without contrast upon arrival back home, and then to follow up with a Neurologist. He has been home nearly a week now and feels like himself. He has had the MRI, which came back normal (yay!), but we are waiting to see a Neurologist at hospital. The ONLY thing in patient life that had changed for him in the days, weeks, months preceding this super surprising event, was his Covid #2 Pfizer vaccine. That is why we, and our supportive doctor, are suspicious that this may have been the cause. We are a little nervous about whether or not more seizures will take place, or perhaps his body is done dealing with his probably strong reaction to the immunologic/inflammatory variable. Maybe altitude could have played in, along with the vaccine, and been the straws that broke the camel&#39;s back of other things maybe brewing? But we don&#39;t think so. patient has had NO health issues, other than an appendix out 3 years ago! Thanks for listening. We want this variable to you as a data point.

His chin was pinned to his chest, he struggled to breath and was making a sound as if he was loudly snoring but seemed to be struggling to breathe. I was unable to wake him. I&#39;m not sure how long it lasted but maybe 2 minutes or so. He woke up and asked what was going on as we had all been standing over him trying to unsuccessfully wake him.  He shared that he thought he&#39;d been asleep and had been dreaming. He also shared that his throat hurt very much. He had the shakes for about 30 minutes after and was extremely exhausted. He slept for 14 hours as soon as we arrived home.

Provided the patient with a cold pack for the back of his neck and water to drink, and encouraged him to sit with his head lowered. The patient&#39;s father pointed out that he had not had anything to eat that morning, which could have contributed to his response. After a few minutes, most of the symptoms abated, and patient was feeling much better. His father left the store with him at that time. Called the father later that day, and he said patient was feeling better. Had taken nap and was only feeling a little tired. I explained possible side effects from vaccine and father thanked me for our time and concern.

He was with normal mentation, walking on his own, and talking with his stepfather in the waiting room. Within 1-2 minutes in the waiting room, he leaned to the right in his chair, hit the glass (glass did not crack or shatter, no head injury), and was not responsive for about 5 seconds. His father called his name and grabbed his hand but no response. I rushed over and patient became responsive and endorses not remembering what happened.  He does not remember the event. No body shaking, tongue biting, or incontinence.  He was taken back to the vital room, and his first BP was 70/35, pulse in the 60s. He denied any symptoms, and physical exam including neurological exam were normal. He was speaking coherently and with good mentation.  He was given a water to drink. Repeat blood pressure 5 minutes later improved to 96/59 with no medication.  He was moved to a clinic room and was laid supine with his legs elevated.  Orthostatic blood pressures were within normal limits (111/63 supine, 110/72 sitting, 109/69 standing). Patient was able to walk out on his own and was in normal mentation.  No medications were given or interventions wee done.

Then he started to seem like he might pass out.  Then he was shaking for a few moments and his body straightened out on the chair and he seemed like he might be having a seizure.  I had someone call 9-1-1. I stayed with him until the paramedics arrived.  He kept seeming like he was nodding off, but when I spoke to him he was responsive.  By the time the paramedics arrived he said he was feeling better, but they checked him out, BP and HR and blood O2 were normal.  The paramedics offered transport to hospital but patient and his adult family member declined, and patient went home with his family member.

A 17-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Apr2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EW1064) as SINGLE DOSE  (at age of 17 years old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included epilepsy (interactable epilepsy) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications.  Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1 on 25Mar2021 09:00, lot number as ER8733,  in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation(at age of 17 years old). On 17Apr2021, the patient experienced increased seizure activity, fatigue/tired, confusion and memory issues. After the 2nd shot, about 4-5 hours, he experienced increased seizure activity and it has progressed to today, today he is a little bit better but it has progressed to point he is having a lot of confusion and memory issues. He has several different types of seizures but he has what are called mini seizures, the blank stare, the confusion. Nothing has stopped completely, he isn&#39;t back to his baseline as far as his seizures. He always has seizures, daily so she is calling about the increased activity and when she says his baseline she means he has not returned back to his baseline activity, but he is doing better than yesterday.  Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were horrible. Today he started to get back to his normal self. The events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room or Physician Office. Outcome of the increased seizure activity/mini seizures, confusion and memory issues were recovering. Outcome of fatigue/tired were not recovered.

We scheduled an appointment for our primary doctor which we went to on the 5/12/21. The doctor and I &#43; my mom talked and they said we should report this because there was nothing else that could of caused the Bells Palsy.

                                                Pt was seen at ED on5/8 for L sided weakness in the setting of a headache. Pt?s mother reports that these symptoms began 2 days after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in R deltoid. She says that on 5/6, pt complained of L arm weakness during cooking class at school, which was followed by a mild L sided headache later in the day. Symptoms resolved without intervention but recurred on 5/8 with associated L sided facial droop, slurred speech, L arm spasms, and L foot drag.  Pt was seen at  ED for this and had a HA (5/10 in severity) at that time -- workup was unremarkable with a normal head CT, laboratory workup, and resolution of symptoms. Pediatric Neurology evaluated the pt, deemed no further workup necessary, and advised outpatient follow up.   Pt presented again to the ED on 5/10 with concern for full tonic/clonic seizure, witnessed by pt?s mother. Mother reports that she heard pt fall and went upstairs to find pt seizing on his bed -- says that pt had shaking of bilateral upper extremities (in flexed position close to chest) and symmetric lower extremity shaking; eyes were closed without clear focality or eye deviation. Also some drooling, though no incontinence or tongue biting. Episode lasted for approximately 2 minutes; pt was confused and did not recall what happened immediately afterwards but improved within the next 8 minutes. He was taken to the ED by EMS.   By the time he arrived in the ED, he had left sided weakness again. He was given Keppra 1g, placed on EEG, and was admitted. EEG overnight was read &#34;normal&#34; and additional workup was unremarkable. Pt had MRI brain completed showing cortical abnormalities in the R parietal lobe, suspected to be related to recent seizure. MRA showed patent intracranial cerebral vasculature. MRV showed no evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. Weakness resolved by the morning and pt was back to baseline on morning of 5/11/21. However, around 9 AM, L sided weakness (face, arm&gt;leg) with associated headache recurred. Mom says that this event was captured on EEG. He was then transferred to our facility. He was placed on pEEG and had repeat labs, imaging completed. Pt did have L sided facial droop, L arm weakness, and slurred speech on arrival, but this resolved within 24 hours. Pt had one additional episode of &#34;wave&#34; of L sided weakness including L sided facial droop and slurred speech at one other time during the hospitalization, but no additional seizure like activity. He was discharged on 5/14 with a normal neuro exam-- some labs (including labs of Rheum and Id workup were pending at time of discharge.) Primary and consulting teams elected to forgo steroids but reconsider should symptoms worsen or return. Pt was readmitted on 5/16-- had an episode of expressive aphasia &#43; headache while at a social gathering; states that he became overwhelmed by the noise. No additional seizure like activity.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine in the morning, then woke at about midnight. He went to get a drink of water, and was holding a glass of water in his hand. He started to feel as if the room was spinning, became very sweaty, had ringing in both ears, and lost consciousness, striking his head on the counter. The event was unwitnessed. He reports waking approximately 1 hour later with a bad headache. He had a headache and felt disoriented. He denies urinary/bowel incontinence or tongue biting. He was able to walk back to his room without difficulty, took ibuprofen, and went back to sleep. He woke the next morning with nausea and vomited, but this did not impact his headache. He has not had any notable neurologic symptoms since that time, but continues to have a minor headache. He has not had any further vomiting. Headache has not subsequently woken him from sleep and does not worsen with recumbent positioning. He denies visual changes, memory changes, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, ringing in his ears, or dizziness. He says his headache is located mostly around his forehead and at the top of his head that is now mild and feels like pressure ?like a tension type headache.? His mother is a nurse, and evaluated him the next day. The family did not feel that he needed to be seen in the emergency department, or prior to this visit. He has not had any previous episodes that were similar. Patient was evaluated in my clinic. Complete neurologic exam was within normal limits. He has been referred to neurology for further assessment.

When dad came, we registered patient as normal asking if he feels ill or not and he stated no. When I brought him back to the room we were talking about school and activities he is in and he seemed normal and answering normally just tired. I cleaned his arm and talked him through things that can happen with the second dose of Pfizer. He seemed just fine and once I injected and bandaged him he went stiff and I tried to talk to him and he did not respond. I called for help and they got his dad. he finally started coming too and was extremely warm. I sat with him for 10 to 15 minutes and rubbed his back and we got him water to drink. we started an incident report right away while talking to the dad. nothing further happened and he was told to go straight to the clinic to be checked out.

                                                He had normal - tired, kind of sicky feeling when he woke up on Thursday. At 07:00pm, he had pain behind his right knee. I told him to drink more water and I gave him some Tylenol. I told him to keep me posted as to how he felt. The next morning, he said he hadn&#39;t slept all night - he had a dull pain that didn&#39;t go away when he moved. It traveled up his upper leg and up to his right hip. Moving and stretching didn&#39;t make it go away. Constant dull pain. I took him to ER. It took 36 -48 hours before it faded. He didn&#39;t wake up with it on Saturday.

                                                On 4/6 my son noticed changes with his vision which continued to 4/7 at which time we brought him to his pcp. She referred us to his eye doctor. They got him in that afternoon, did an exam, told us to follow up that Friday. At the 4/9 follow up he was diagnosed with sixth nerve palsy on the left eye. We scheduled a MRI and lab work. Lab work came back fine. He went for the MRI on 4/16. The MRI showed several brain lesions pointing towards MS. We went to a medical center on 4/20 where they thought the finding lesion were incidental and not related to MS. We saw a neuro-opthamologist on 4/21, who said he felt my son did have MS with sixth nerve palsy. We saw a neurologist on the afternoon of 4/21 who said patient didn&#39;t meet the criteria of MS and to follow up another MRI in 3 months. That weekend patient started with areas on numbness. He was due for second covid injection which all providers agreed with us getting. He got his second dose on 4/24 during this flare of numbness. We went back the neurologist on 4/26. Patient was given a three day iv steroid infusion, lab work and follow up MRI. The follow up MRI showed more lesions in his brain which lead us to the neurologist in another state. Dr reviewed both MRIs, felt the lesions were incidental, the flare of numbness as well at the sixth nerve palsy of his eye were related to inflammation related to the vaccine he received.

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm, at age 17 years, on 12Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pressure in his eye from an injury, asthma (diagnosed when the patient was about 2) and has family members with asthma and heart conditions. Patient is in perfect health, he works out 6 days a week, and does football conditioning 5 days a week. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Concomitant medication included timolol taken for pressure in his eye from an injury from an unspecified start date to 20May2021. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The patient historically received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number: EP7534) at the left arm at age 17 years on 22Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient got his second dose of the vaccine on 12Apr2021 and shorty after on 19Apr2021, he became very fatigued, very weak, his chest hurt, and he had shortness of breath. On Apr2021, patient had dizziness. The patient used to have bulky arms and now you can see his muscle mass depleting in Apr2021. The patient cannot focus on school online because of the headaches from 19Apr2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure goes up and down from 19Apr2021. For days from 19Apr2021, the patient&#39;s heart rate will be fine in the 60s and it goes up to 120 or 130 with chest pain, it fluctuates depending on the day.  The patient visited the emergency room on 05May2021, but was not admitted and no one knows what was going on with the vaccine. It was also reported that the patient lost 14 pounds on 25Apr2021 since the second dose of the vaccine. They knew the patient has already lost 10 pounds and then yesterday, 25May2021, the patient weighed himself and noticed he has lost another 4 pounds over the weekend. Patient had bloodwork on 20May2021 and it was all negative. The primary care provider was concerned about the weight loss so she ran a bunch of blood work. The patient is negative for COVID test and chest x-ray on 21May2021 and he has had multiple tests done. The patient went to his primary care provider on 25May2021 (yesterday from the time off reporting) and the reporter mentioned that maybe can they look at this as being a side effect from the vaccine. The patient&#39;s doctor laughed and said nothing has been proven yet about this. The reporter felt that this is a reaction to the vaccine. At the time of reporting on 26May2021, the patient was not able to function and sleeps all day. The patient also underwent lab tests and procedures that includes being tested negative for mono twice now (on unspecified dates). Clarified that they have not filed a safety report with Pfizer on the patient&#39;s events. The outcome of the events &#39;dizziness&#39;, &#39;lost 14 pounds since the second dose of the vaccine/lost another 4 pounds over the weekend&#39;, &#39;muscle mass depleting&#39;, &#39;cannot focus on school online&#39;, &#39;not able to function&#39; and &#39;sleeps all day&#39; was unknown; while for the other events, it was not recovered.

                                                Approximately 24 hours  after secondPfizer dose, 17 year old male awoke in the morning and was complaining of intense throat pain radiating into the upper chest  relieved by sitting up.  NSAIDS not helpful, went to narcotic med to relieve, which it did with single tab of medication.  Other symptoms, fatigue, body aches, low fever.  Waxed and waned over 48 hour time period from onset, with another intense episode  of throat/chest pain 24 hours in from onset requiring narcotic pain med to relief.   Again this was in the morning.  One episode of vomiting during second intense period with what looked like water that just hadn&#39;t gone down his throat, and following this he reported some relief from what he described as a radiating burning sensation up under the lower jaw and radiating into the upper chest.  No shortness of breath ever.   Burning sensation in throat and chest resolved by 72 hours with no more episodes of the acute throat and chest pain after the two episodes.  While ED was considered due to the distress being experienced, we decided against since the narcotic med was helping and no shortness of breath was being experienced.  I did try to get on with the CDC to report my concerns when it was happening to see if others were reporting this, then because it was a concerning reaction, but site was difficult to navigate and I was trying to monitor.  I did not call the pediatrician at that time as I am a health care worker and felt I could assess and make decisions based on findings.   Following the recent reports of myocarditis in teens, especially males, I felt obligated to report this experience.   This child has no history of heart ailment.  No tests were done to assess what might have been the cause.  I assumed it was an outside-the-box reaction to the second Pfizer dose.

Patient appeared to have seizure like activity and paramedic called immediately. After 1 to 2 minutes patient started responded well and just stated she felt very faint. Paramedics arrived and waiting for patient to fully recovered. They did state her blood pressure decreased to below baseline but quickly came back up to normal as patient started feeling better. They deemed patient to be stable and didn&#39;t think it was from the vaccine itself versus receiving an injectable vaccine as patient often feels faint after giving blood. They walked patient and grandmother to their personal car so she coudl be taken home.

                                                The pt received the Pfizer vaccine and after 1-2 minutes of sitting the pt fainted and bumped his head on the concrete floor.  The pt was sweating and not responding for about 5 minutes, after the pt was awake and the EMS saw him the pt started feeling much better and did not wan t to go to the  hospital.  The pt only had juice and it was after 1:00pm so this could have been a contributing factor.  The pt stayed 30 more minutes with me after the EMS left and he was completely fine.  I also think the pt since he was a minor was really nervous.

(Unsure of which Tdap or lot#) at 11:30 pm 6/18/2021 he was fine. About 30 mins later he was hit hard with side effects. Said he was very shaky and felt hot and cold at the same time. He did not let me know about this until this morning around 7:50 am 06/19/2021 about how he was feeling and he was still feeling very bad, advised him to take tylenol and he took that and went back to sleep. Around 12:00 PM 06/19/2021 I was finally able to check his temperature and other vitals. His temperature was normal, but his heart rate was 138 bpm. I made him sit down and relax for a bit and heart rate leveled out to normal.  He also reported he is afraid to eat that he feels nauseous. As of this afternoon 06/19/2021 he seems to be feeling better.

They seemed to worsen throughout day &amp; with laying down. Then, increasing pain along left side of body into hip and leg around 5:30pm. He experienced very &#34;bad, cramp-like&#34; pain in left calf area around 6:30pm. Sharp Chest pains intermittent at &#34;10 pain level&#34; &amp; lower left leg at &#34;8 pain level&#34;. Some nausea and vomited once at this point. We called the urgent care line for our doctor&#39;s office and spoke with  nurse who instructed us to go to the ER. They performed ECG and Chest XR. Labs were BMP, CBC, CK, D-dimer (quantitative), &amp; Triponon-I.  They gave 800mg Motrin, IV fluids and keterolac in IV. They said they &#34;did not identify a specific problem&#34; but to rest, take ibuprofen, and follow-up with doctor and cardiologist. They said it was most likely related to the Covid-19 vaccination but could not give causation.  Patient seems fine so far today, but still has medication in system.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, Consumer reported that patient received his first dose. Consumer does not remember the date. On an unspecified date, patient had symptoms (night sweats, different things like that, joints). Patient was sensitive to a lot of things, so consumer is nervous. Consumer heard of healthy people getting the vaccine and dying shortly after. Consumer further wanted to know if he should get the second dose. Consumer indicated he was to have his second dose on Monday but awaiting blood test from HCP, delayed until 14Jun2021. On an unspecified date, the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test with unknown result. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information lot/batch number requested.

At further inspection I noticed that he was having a rash . I had a sit for a few more minutes then his mom came up and we noticed that his arm started to swell. We gave him 2 capsules Benadryl 25mg and instructed him to go to urgent care. Called for a follow up later in the evening and found that urgent care send him to the ER. The rash was spread all over and well as the swelling. He swelled all the way to his toes. He also tuned white and became very lightheaded at the ER. They gave him IV Benadryl and dexamethasone and was sent home. It has been recommended by the ER doctors to not get the 2nd dose.

The following morning he felt feverish and achy with malaise. He stayed home, drank fluids and rested and felt well enough to come up to ski this weekend. During skiing he had some anterior chest pain, it resolved and he went about his day. Tonight at 2245 the pain became sharp and awakened him from sleep. He felt nauseated and clammy as well. Father brought him to the ER for evaluation. His emergency department evaluation showed ST elevations most notably in the inferior and lateral leads as well as in the lateral precordium.

                                                My healthy 18-year old son had his first dose of Pfizer, and within a few minutes he felt dizzy. His heart rate was also rapid. He didn&#39;t think much of it, but the dizziness persisted and so they had him lay down with feet up. After about 20 minutes, he began to vigorously shake (rigors I believe is what it is called.) He felt numb in both arms and also his tongue and mouth. We had 3 nurses attending to him, and after about 30 minutes they decided to send him to the ER for evaluation since the very strong shaking and other symptoms were worsening. The shaking, dizziness, numbness all subsided after about an hour. He was given a Zyrtec upon first symptoms about 15 minutes after dose. The ER doc doesn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction but potentially a strong vasovagal response and immune response. He felt tired after but was completely fine 2 hours later. We were discharged from the ER a few hours later after evaluation. Vitals were in normal range including blood sugar, blood pressure and oxygen. He was fully hydrated prior and had a turkey sandwich and orange prior to coming so was not low on food either. The shaking was very extreme and concerning. It has been almost 24 hours and he is feeling fine other than a sore arm.

                                                Overnight, my (almost 19) son did not wake me, but reported to me in the morning that he had headaches, chills, numbness, thirst, and hallucinations. He was aware that they were not real during and after he had them, but it was a nonetheless disturbing experience.  He described to me having the need to hydrate all night and he drank a lot of water. This morning he was still having a headache and numbness as well as overall malaise, but has taken advil and eaten a light breakfast. He is dressed and up and around and seems to be improving. Should the symptoms return or worsen, we plan to take him for medical care.

I went to sleep and at around 2 or 3 am I woke up freezing cold and sweating, with my left arm (arm I got the shot in) hurting a ton. I didn?t fall asleep for a few hours and couldn?t get out of bed due to coldness, lethargy, and muscle soreness. Next day had a moderate headache throughout the day that Ibuprofen didn?t help with. By 10 pm Friday all symptoms other than arm soreness had disappeared.

                                                I administered first dose of Pfizer covid 19 0.3 ml via intramuscular route to this patient. About 2 minutes after the administration, the patient had syncope for a second. When I arrived to the scene, the patient was conscious. When he passed out, he felt and landed on his head. He had an abrasion. He stated ?he felt hot and dizzy?. He hasn?t had anything to eat all day. Due to the abrasion, he was rushed to the hospital  About 3 hours later, I called to check on the patient. At the time of calling, the patient was discharged from the hospital in good condition. He stated he felt perfectly ok and wasn?t sure what had happened.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Apr2021 at 12:45 (Lot Number: Ew0153) at the age of 18 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism spectrum disorder, ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) combined, learning disabilities. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medication taken within two weeks of vaccination included alfetamine aspartate/alfetamine sulfate/dexamphetamine saccharate/dexamphetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for an unspecified indication. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 in left arm, on 02Apr2021, lot # EK5730. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Apr2021 at 21:00 the patient experienced extreme hallucinations, not feeling well, chills, aches and pains, headaches, slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, he did not get much sleep, fever. The clinical course of events was reported as follows: My son reported to me at bedtime last night, the night of his second Pfizer vaccine dose, that he was not feeling well. I told him to take some Advil and go to bed. He had a very bad night with chills and aches and pains but most distressing was his description of having had extreme hallucinations. He said that he was aware they were hallucinations and not real during and after the experience, but it was nonetheless concerning. It is also concerning that he didn&#39;t wake me for help. At any rate, he did not get much sleep and I have to assume his fever went pretty high before morning. He described to me the need to hydrate during the night. He also relayed to me this morning an experience of headaches and slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, but he is now feeling much better. He is dressed, has eaten, and is playing games on the computer. I am keeping a close eye on him today and should we return to that level of concern, we will take him to urgent care.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

He initially had chest pain the day prior to admission with pain in his back and down his left arm. This improved with Tylenol and resolved prior to bed. On the morning of 5/6 the chest pain returned and was so severe it woke him from sleep. He was difficult for him to characterize, but he said it was all over his chest, sometimes sharp and pressure-like, most severe in mid substernal region and was so substantial that he had difficulty speaking properly. He feels that the pain is most severe when lying flat and is best managed when he is resting at a 45 degree angle. Patient was at ED he was found to have an initial ECG with ST depressions in aVR and elevations in II, aVF, and V2 through V6 raising suspicion for pericarditis/myocarditis. Initial troponin was elevated at 4.35 as well. Cardiology Dr. was contacted by ED physician, case discussed, and EKGs reviewed and felt this was more likely pericarditis, but not STEMI. Of note, he reports a family history significant for his mother having a?hole in her heart.?He was given Toradol with improvement in his pain and upon arrival to hospital his chest pain was markedly improved.  He was noted to have troponins peaking at 39.415 that down trended and an elevated CRP of 4.8 on admission. D-dimer was 0.26. Covid PCR was negative.  He was evaluated by cardiology again here who upon review of his ECG and cardiac enzymes as well as presentation was consistent with pericarditis. Echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function with trace posterior pericardial effusion and telemetry was monitored without any arrhythmias. He was started on low-dose beta-blockers, aspirin 650 mg 3 times a day, and colchicine 0.6 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses followed by 0.6 mg daily. He is planned to continue this for approximately 3 months and will need to follow-up with cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks for repeat monitoring and management with plan to taper off aspirin once his CRP normalizes.  Later that night, he even had a similar episode of sudden onset chest pain for which she received IV Toradol with minimal relief and oral Tylenol with relief of symptoms after that. No telemetry abnormalities were recorded at that time.   ECG the following day showed improving ST changes and troponin of 26.328 with CRP 4.2. He had no further symptoms for over 24 hours and is responding well to treatment.   He is advised to take Tylenol as needed in addition to the above-mentioned medicines should he have any recurrent chest pain.

About 5 minutes later while still being seated in the same seat, Pt started to look like he was going to pass out. His mother tried to keep him engaged and alert by talking to him. I raised his legs to see if it would help. Then, relatively soon after Pt&#39;s upper body and face began to shake and he started to foam from the mouth. We lowered him to the ground and placed him on his side. The &#34;seizure&#34; lasted less than 30 seconds. When Pt became alert and aware he stated he just had a &#34;4 hour dream&#34;. When the paramedics arrived 5  minutes later we had Pt seated in a chair again and he had drank some water. About 5-10 minutes later he began to feel nauseated  and vomited. The paramedics transported Pt to the hospital.

RN lifted his head to open airway and pt started convulsing and turned bright red. RN yelled for help. RN leaned the chair back to lay on the floor, holding patents head so it would not hit hard. Pharmacy worker called 911. Pt stopped convulsions and started coming too then turned very pale. He said he was starting to feel better but wanted to remain laying on the floor. When paramedics arrived they assisted him up in a chair, took his vitals, he was stable. Then checked his blood sugar and pt immediately passed out again. RN again assisted to lay him back in the chair to be flat on the floor. He again became very pale. Paramedics placed him on the gurney and took him to ER to be evaluated.

An 18-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on an unspecified date (at the age of 18 years old) at first dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On an unspecified date on the same day of vaccination, the reporter stated that the patient developed tingling in his right arm mostly the end and then he developed tingling in his right leg. The patient then developed chest pain; because of chest pain, the patient was brought to the emergency room on an unspecified date. The patient underwent electrocardiogram (EKG) that was reportedly normal. The physician brought up the concern that the patient&#39;s mother needed guidance as far as her son should get the second shot or not. The physician stated that patient had extensive treatment for chest pain which is that patient was brought to the emergency room and had an EKG. The outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

I took a warm shower thinking the house was just cold, but when I went to bed after I started shaking with chills. I didn?t sleep well that night and during the day Thursday (01/21) I felt feverish and a throbbing headache. I tried sleeping throughout the day, still having the chills come and go. I took ibuprofen before heading the bed the next night and slept great other than feeling a little hot and sweaty. I showered the next morning and felt 100% again.

Sat down he started to sweat profusely. Told him to take his sweatshirt off. Continues to sweat his forehead his T-shirt was wet his back was wet. Then he tilted his head back his eyes rolled back into his head. I called the nurse. We got him to a wheelchair and behind the curtain. Before we had a chance to put him on the Exam Table he passed out and started to seize for the count of 3 or 4 seconds. Then he woke up. He said he saw white beautiful light. I am not kidding. He does not joke. Then he said he was fine. Insisted he was fine.  His bp was low for the first two readings. Then It came back up to normal. He laid flat for 15 more min. Had some juice. Sat up when It was gone to go. Bp got super high. We waited till It was normal and left.

Basically chills, fever, headache, and just overall body cramps. Overall just felt super dizzy and could barely walk due to the dizziness and fatigue. About an hour later, I had trouble breathing and started hyperventilating. My body started cramping up all over to the point where I couldn?t move any part of my body and my entire body was tingly and it felt like I was having a heart attack but I believe it might have been a panic attack. I have not had many symptoms to vaccines in the past. Only meningitis B

He reports yesterday morning he was woken from sleep at 3-4 am with severe substernal chest pains that radiated to his arm and neck. This was worsened by laying flat and better if he waked around/pacing. He took ibuprofen and it got better so he went back to sleep. The pain returned about 6 hours later and was getting more severe so he went to see his doctor. There an EKG was abnormal so he was referred to the ED where a work up showed ST elevations c/w pericarditis and an elevated trop I of 24.   The night prior, he reported a low grade temperature. He has not had any more fevers for the past 12-18 hours. He denies any other symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, cough syncope. He denies sick contacts but did have a sore throat 4-5 days ago without any other associated symptoms. He has had recent negative COVID tests while at college.    Of note he did receive the 2nd dose of Pfizer on 5/15 about 24-36 hours before onset of symptoms.    Of note, he does boxing at school and has been participating in work outs until about a week ago.   ED course: EKG w/ diffuse ST segment elevation in V3-V6, I, II, II, AVF. Troponin I 24. Creatnine 1.2 with baseline of 0.5 but BUN WNL (11). CBC WNL, CRP mildly elevated to 3.1, Transferred to another ED.   Second ED Course: BP 120/64  | Pulse 83  | Temp 36.7 °C (98.1 °F) (Temporal)  | Resp 18  | Wt 76.3 kg  | SpO2 97% exam non-focal, COVID ab notable for &#43;spike neg nuclear capsid consistent with vax but no infection, D-Dimer, procal, ESR, ferritin, Coags all WNL, Trop T elevated to 1.46,, ECG with consistent diffuse ST seg elevations, seen by ped cards who did echo in ED and notable for EF ~50%, admitted to PCICU for further management and treatment  Admitted to the PCICU in stable condition. Placed on telemetry monitoring for the duration of the admission. Started on IV steroids and given IVIG on hospital day 1. Continued on toradol which was switched to motrin on hospital day 2. Cardiac MRI did not show signs of fibrosis. Troponin downtrended throughout his stay. At the time of DC echo showed normal function, ekg showed T wave inverions, and troponin was down trending to 0.57. Pt to be restricted from physical activity until cleared by cardiology. Infectious workup also sent, most of which was pending at time of discharge.

A 19-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0187, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 22May2021 11:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of historical vaccine, bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0176, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 01May2021 10:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect were none. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations were none. Family medical history relevant to adverse events was none. Relevant tests were unknown. It was reported that her 19-year-old son got the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 22May2021 and 2 days later on 24May2021, he wound up with chest pain and the caller took him to emergency room and the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis and admitted to the hospital. The Reporter clarified the patient&#39;s chest pain started when he woke up around 08:30-09:00. On an unspecified date in May2021 at 23:30, the patient had a fever starting about 12 hours from receiving the second dose and it lasted for 24 hours, and the patient didn&#39;t feel well on an unspecified date in May2021. At one point he didn&#39;t want to wake his parents up around 11:30 p.m. but he was warm on an unspecified date in May2021. At 0600am the next day, the caller took the patient&#39;s temperature, and his fever was 100.9 Fahrenheit. The caller carried the patient to the emergency room on 24May2021 due to his chest pain. It was reported that patient&#39;s EKG was extremely irregular and caller stated that if it was her or her husband&#39;s EKG, they would have been having an MI, but since the patient was only 19, the doctors didn&#39;t think MI was possible. The patient was then diagnosed with myocarditis. It was reported that the patient experienced diarrhea on 24May2021. Chest Pain required a visit to Emergency Room on 24May2021 and the patient was hospitalized from 24May2021 to 26May2021. It was reported that, the patient received treatment with Colchicine 0.6 mg (NDC number and Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: 26may2022) one tablet by mouth twice a day. The patient came home from the hospital with this prescription on 26May2021 and he is still taking this medication. Prescribed to take it twice daily for a month. Famotidine, it is like a Pepcid. 20 mg (NDC number and Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: 26Mayy2021) one tablet by mouth twice a day for 6 days, because of the heavy dose of ibuprofen and diarrhea. The patient had completed this medication. Ibuprofen 600 mg (NDC number, Lot number: unknown and Expiration Date: unknown) 1 tablet by mouth three times a day for six days and this has script had ended. Caller stated that her son was recovered but that he was still taking the treatment medications at this time. Caller stated that her son&#39;s symptoms are improved, he was not complaining of chest pain anymore, she assumes his myocarditis was improved because he was not complaining of the chest pain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 100.9 Fahrenheit on an unspecified date in May2021, EKG (electrocardiogram): extremely irregular on 24May2021, PCR COVID test (sars-cov-2 test): negative on an unspecified date in May2021 while in the hospital. Caller stated the patient had an EKG showing irregular heartbeat.It was reported that the patient had tests but she didn&#39;t have results available and the patient had a PCR COVID test in the ER. Caller stated that all of this was related to the vaccine. Caller also stated that she is wondering if her son would have reacted differently if he had gotten the Moderna, but caller and her husband had gotten Pfizer and didn&#39;t have any problems. Reporter seriousness for Myocarditis, diarrhea and fever was unspecified. The outcome of the events, Myocarditis, chest pain, diarrhea and irregular heartbeat was recovering and for fever was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021 and for other events was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

A 19-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm in muscle on 07May2021 17:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 19-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There was no medical history.   No family medical history relevant to events.  There were no concomitant medications.  No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 07May2021, his vision got all spotty and he could not see, pupils got bigger than normal after the vaccine, had blue lips, white face, blood pressure really dropped, and he lost vision at one time immediately afterwards, and he felt cold. The time of onset of events was around 5pm. Events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. They stated they had given a thousand of this vaccine and this had never happened before. They stated they had never seen what happened to his son before. The patient did not get the second one yet and was told not to get it. All events happened a few minutes after the vaccine during the sitting/waiting period. About after 5 minutes the most after administration this all started and they had to treat him with an ammonia thing to wake him up. It&#39;s the one you break it under the nose and they were ready to do an Epi Pen also if needed. He improved within half an hour to 45 minutes of this. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. Mentioned they all in his family did the Covid vaccine.  The patient improved and they advised him not to get the second one. It was Facility to tell them that. The pharmacist from there just gave them a call wanting to know why the son didn&#39;t return for the second dose and he explained what happened since this pharmacist did not know what happened that day. Patient did not see doctor or go to emergency room since his condition improved dramatically after about 45 minutes or so. Father kept asking patient how he felt or if there was need to see doctor and patient declined. The outcome of events was recovering.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

These spasms lasted until roughly 8am and were strong enough to rattle my 300lb bed frame. The only treatment I could think of at the time was to get as warm as I could so i covered myself in 8 blankets and just waited it out. It is now noon and the chills/spasms seem to be gone.

                                                12 hours after receiving my second Pfizer vaccine, I woke up shaking and unable to stop. It went away after a minute or two but over the course of the next 2 hours, I had muscle spasms and shaking that I could not control. It slowly faded away. I am a healthy 20 year old with no other health issues and this had never happened before. After 30 minutes of off and on shaking, I went to the ER, and they monitored me for a little before telling me it was fine to go home once it subsided.

I walked over to him within 60-120 seconds after the vaccine administration and found him to be in a stiff full body extended position while sitting on a chair. I asked him if he was ok. He did not respond. Called over the nurse and we were about to bring him down to the ground after suspecting a seizure. Patient &#34;came to&#34; after about 90 seconds of no movement. Patient became alert and orientated. When asked about prior seizure history, patient stated they had a traumatic injury to their back within the last month which resulted with spontaneous seizures throughout the past 2 weeks. Patient was asked to follow-up with primary care provider or seek urgent care/emergency care if it happens again. Patient observed for 30&#43; minutes until his girlfriend came to pick him up.

His neurologist had increased Bacolfen and we had scheduled a follow-up for May. He went to the ER, but was not in life threatening danger and additional tests were completed. He has been tired for a month. Then, he had his second shot, and he has begun having muscle spasms/seizures again.

On April 27th morning he started having severe involuntary head shaking like &#34;no&#34; severe along with arms flailing causing shoulder dislocations, with arms flailing also accidentally punched own nose.  The head shaking lasted all day through bed time despite normal doses of clonazepam 1mg given.   At 1:15 a.m.  had a tonic clonic seizure which was different than his &#34;usual&#34; ones.  This morning he just woke up at 0715 and has started with the head/shoulder twitches.  Yesterday his gait was much more unsteady than usual as well.   Our entire family had the vaccine same day and we all only had mild side effects, brother and sister also have complex medical.  Thank you for all you do.

This 20-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number ER8731) on 14Apr2021 16:45 at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number ER8733) on 28Mar2021 12:00 in right arm. The patient had no Known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no COVID tested post vaccination. The patient had not received other vaccine in four weeks. On 15Apr2021 04:00, his body was involuntarily twitching and his teeth was opening and closing as if he was having a seizure. He thought it was because he was cold so he put on 3 layers of clothes and 2 bundles of blankets and turned the heat up, but his body was still shaking and he was still cold. He tried to go back to sleep to see if that would fix it, but it did not until he went to work and around 7:30 a.m., the shivering stopped, but the headaches persisted and he had to ask to go home and he received an occurrence because he did not have a doctor&#39;s note. He clocked out at 8 and he went to sleep for an hour in the car in the parking lot because he was in no condition to drive home. Treatment received for the events included Acetaminophen and rest. The outcome of teeth was opening and closing as if I was having a seizure, body was involuntarily twitching, was cold, shaking, was resolving. The outcome of shivering was resolved. The outcome of headaches was not resolved.

The physician reported similar events for two patients, this is the first of two reports.   A 20-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration at 20 years old on 17Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on an unspecified date for covid-19 immunization. Caller reported that he had a patient who received his Pfizer vaccine, second dose last Saturday (17Apr2021). He reported that on Monday (19Apr2021) he continued to experience arm pain followed by difficulty moving his arm. Now he was requiring a sling, had been prescribed Toradol and Steroids but was not doing any better. He was having continued weakness and pain under his shoulder. Caller was asking for documentation or studies that have been done to determine if the vaccine has any relationship with Parson Turner Syndrome (neuritis) and recommendations for management. He asked to speak with a Pfizer Neurologist. Caller reported that the patient was being seen by an orthopedist, MD. Caller was requesting urgent escalation of his inquiry for further investigation into a relationship between the covid vaccine and Parson Turner Syndrome (neuritis). The outcome of the events was unknown.  No Follow-up attempts are needed.

                                                Patient was very nervous prior to administration.  After receiving the vaccination, pt walked back to his waiting area, then asked for assistance.  He lost consciousness for a few seconds and briefly convulsed/arms contractured up.  This lasted less than 20 seconds in total but he was slow to fully regain awarenesss/consciousness.  This returned over the course of 1-2 minutes.  EMS was called and responded.  They spoke with the patient but by this time he had consumed 8-16oz liquid, eaten a snack, and was fully aware and alert.

When I came upon him his eyes were open and he was able to answer questions. he stated that he did not have any problems breathing, but felt dizzy. He was very clammy so we took his bp and it was 142/65 pulse 64, gave him an ice pack and had him stay laying down. He sat up after awhile and took a few sips of water but started to feel light headed again so we had him lay back down. His bp went down to 105/58 pulse 61, but then came back up to 136/81 pulse 75 as he was starting to feel better. He started to get more color in his face and feel less clammy so I stayed sitting up. We put him in a chair eventually and the EMTs arrived shortly later. They did and evaluation, but as they were talking about whether or not to take him to the hospital he passed out again. The EMTs said he was probably having some anxiety to needles. He then said that he had passed out giving blood once.  They took him to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Approximately three to four minutes after the second dose, he reported feeling dizzy. A few seconds later he lost consciousness with eyes rolled to the back of his head. He was unresponsive to verbal communication or attempts to shake him awake. He then began grunting and struggling for breath. His body began to shake/convulse and he lost control of his bladder. This lasted about five to ten seconds. He regained consciousness and reported that he felt as if he was &#34;dreaming&#34;. He also reported feeling very hot, and had sweat dripping down his face. Paramedics were called to the scene where his vital signs were checked. All signs including temperature were normal. His first dose on /26/21 had an almost exact reaction, minus losing control of bladder, although that time nobody was around to assist him.

Prior to vomiting, school staff reported that he seemed unwell (pt. is severely disabled and has very limited speech).  The first episode of vomiting was followed by multiple (4-5) episodes of vomiting blood.  School staff including the school nurse report observing clots in the blood, bright red blood, and brown coffee ground type blood in the vomit.  The school staff called 911 and pt. was transported to Hospital.  In the ambulance pt. vomited again and the paramedic reported observing blood in the vomit. Pt. was observed in the ER and given Zofran and liquids.  Blood tests and a CT scan with and without contrast were performed.  Neither tests explained the bloody vomiting. Pt has since stopped vomiting and is resting quietly at home and eating normally.  The hospital referred Noah to a Gastroenterologist for follow up.

A 20-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 13May2021 at 11:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient is very strict on his health. The patient is a vegetarian, he is very health conscious. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tenderness at the shot site and was very tired. On the morning of 14May2021, the patient had a small temperature that was one degree higher than before and the patient was wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired. Then the patient started experiencing chest pain within days of the second dose. The patient woke up on 15May2021 with chest pain that was persistent through 18May2021. On 19May2021, the chest pain got worse. The reporter thought the patient had indigestion so she gave the patient Tylenol, Pepcid, and clear soda and the patient felt a little better. On 20May2021, the patient was clutching his chest and had pain in his left arm. The patient couldn&#39;t talk, the pain was so hard. The patient went to the emergency room at 12:00 and the healthcare team said that the patient was experiencing a heart attack (reported time of heart attack was 10:00). The patient was not admitted to the hospital. They said the chemical that the large muscle in the heart makes, it was elevated which was how they determined it was a heart attack. These lab numbers were drawn every three hours and they came down but never went away. The patient had two Troponin draws and they were both elevated. They also did an EKG on the patient which showed a heart attack. The patient was told to see a cardiologist and was sent home. The reporter is watching the patient and the patient is still in a little bit of pain but not as much. The patient went to his primary care provider on the day of the report and the doctor doesn&#39;t see this as a displaced issue. The doctor does not know what would cause this in the heart. The patient is to see the cardiologist on Tuesday, 25May2021. The reporter is unsure if this is related to the vaccine but it was almost a week after the patient&#39;s second dose. The outcome of the event small temperature that was one degree higher than before was recovering and the outcome of the event wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested

In brief, 20-year-old neurologically normal man with history of asthma now presenting with new onset fever, headache and then status epilepticus. On 5/25 the patient received his second dose of COVID vaccine and then started to have intermittent fevers up to 102.5.  This was associated with malaise, nausea, fever, headache, myalgias.  He came to ED on 5/30 and had IVF, analgesics and a cardiac workup that was unremarkable and was discharged with diagnosis of possible pericarditis/myocarditis.  He then had ongoing worsening headaches and increasing fevers and was unable to get out of his bed, and so his wife called 911 and he came to ED on 6/3.  There he had vomiting and transaminitis and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis treated with flagyl. Headaches progressed and were associated with dizziness; he had HCT read as unremarkable but then while awaiting MRI had convulsion.  He was returned to his room and had two more and thus was intubated, placed on propofol/versed, Keppra, dilantin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir before transfer to UCSF. on 6/5/2021 found to have reduced urine output, and serum creatinine found to be 1.72 and climbed &gt;7 in days later normalized spontaneously with fluid support to 4.26 with continued improvement.  LFTs were also found to be elevated.  Was acutely encephalopathic. Seizures resolved on Keppra treatment though had acute agitation for several days. Slowly returning to neurologic baseline. with AKI and LFTs slowly normalizing.

At approximately 3:10pm, I heard a loud bang and peeked my head out of the pharmacy and saw that there was a young man on the floor. He fell into the endcap. I immediately ran out to the customer. Upon talking to him, he did not pass out or hit his head but did severely scratch the left side of his cheek to his neck above is collar bone.  I checked his blood pressure and it was 119/79. He initially said he felt very hot and was sweaty, then we gave the patient orange juice as he stated he hadn&#39;t had much to eat, and felt better after drinking the juice. He denied EMS and called his grandmother to come pick him up.

                                                neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression; neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression; flu like symptoms; fevers; chills; diarrhea; chest pain; shakiness; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable The reporter. This The reporter reported for a 20-year-old male patient (Reporter&#39;s son) via medical information team.  A 20-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 (20-year-old at the time of vaccination) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included illness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. The reporter also stated that there are no mental health issues noted in their family history. The reporter also stated that the patient was overall healthy with no significant medical history in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter reported that patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on Saturday and by Monday was having flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. After receiving the COVID 19 vaccines, the patient has been seen by the doctor 3 times in one week. The patient&#39;s side effects have lasted 3-4 weeks. The reporter would like to know commonly reported side effects of the vaccine and their duration. The reporter would like to know the efficacy of only one dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine as the patient was hesitant to get the 2nd dose due to the side effects noted from the 1st vaccine. The reporter was advised per &#34;attached&#34; dose for efficacy after one dose. The reporter was not satisfied with this data and wanted to know more about what she had been read about online. The reporter was advised caller agent as could do some more research and contact her back with possible additional data which caller agreed to doing. Upon call back on 14Jun2021, advised caller per (website &#34;PRIVACY&#34;) from 10Dec2020. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients began to diverge by 12 days after the first dose, and 52.4% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval: 29.5, 68.4) was observed between dose 1 and dose 2, indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. Two doses of vaccine provide the maximum protection observed. Ten cases of severe COVID-19 were observed with onset after the first dose. Nine cases occurred among placebo recipients and one among BNT162b2 recipients. The reporter would like to know dosing interval between shot one and two. Patient had their 1st dose on 14May2021 and has not received the 2nd dose yet due to side effects from what they felt was caused by the 1st dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The reporter received response as &#34;you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision&#34;. The reporter wanted to know should the patient get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine after the reported side effects of flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. The reporter received response as do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of the events was resolved in 2021  Follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number has been requested

                                                For 2 days he had arm pain and hot flashes. Day 3 he felt better but had some arm cramping. 84 hours after the vaccine he woke with tremors for several hours overnight; he then continue to experience muscle twitching but the tremor resolved the next morning. That day he noticed he felt very fatigued. The twitching and spasms lasted about 3 or 4 days. The legs will still spasm at nighttime and he still feels fatigued with less exercise tolerance. His baseline was 2-3 miles walking without difficulty prior to the vaccine, lately a mile will wipe him out. He also noticed intermittent midline pain around his breastbone that has improved. He hasn&#39;t had any shortness of breath. He had poor circulation to his hands and were cold and white but that resolved. He did not have sensory changes. His symptoms overall have been improving.

                                                When reviewing forms with patient the patient disclosed a shellfish allergy. He described the symptoms of his skin turning red, shaking, and swelling in his throat as swelling in the past. He indicated that he had needed to use an epi pen in the past for his allergy.  He still wanted the vaccination and knew we had an epi pen handy.  He was given the vaccination in his left arm and was set up next to the staff development employee who was timing and monitoring patient&#39;s for symptoms. An epi pen was given to the monitor so it would be handy.  The patient&#39;s right hand started shaking within a minute and it was hard to tell if it was from being anxious.  Patient continued to communicate verbally and stated he wanted to use the epi pen.  911 was called by the staff and the staff member with the epi pen took it and the patient out of the main area. Paramedics transported him to the hospital with slight tachycardia and never did administer epi pen while in facility. Patient was always conscious and able to verbally communicate.

Began with severe full body chills and full body muscle shaking and weakness during the night of 1/5 and early morning of 1/6, around 1000 to 0200. Slight headache began during that time as well.   Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

On Sunday, I got a burning red rash on my anterior arm, but it went away in a hour. By Wednesday, when I visited my doctor, the hives were not red, only a small dot was left.

Symptoms almost completely resolved after that period, occasionally had some very mild joint pain still.*Note after both doses, pain in left arm was more severe than right arm* Starting the night of Jan 22 (fri) started having light leg pain, which carried into the 22nd. Dismissed it as too much walking the next day.Jan 24: leg pain a bit more severe, from a 1-2 to a 2-3. Included joint pain in left knee and ankle. Jan 25: pain in both legs at a 3-4, also mild pain in left arm (1-2) as well as joint pain. Jan 26: pain in left arm more severe, leg pain similar in severe. Very mild pain in right arm starting that evening, though only in upper arm. No joint pain in right arm Jan 27: pain in left arm similar in severity, slight increase in right arm pain, would rate 2-3 in right arm, 3-4 in left arm, 3-4 in legs. Muscle weakness in legs (legs shaking when walking down stairs for example) Jan 28 (Thurs):Symptoms started fading. Arm pain lowered in severity in both arms, as did leg pain. By Saturday all that remained was mild leg pain (1-2 in severity)Since then, leg pain has persisted.  Week of Feb 14, leg pain increased in severity back to a 3-4. Visited the doctor on the 17th and had blood-work done on the 23rd after severity didn&#39;t decrease. Blood-work was normal other than slightly elevated lymphocyte % (50.8%)Visited a specialty medicine doctor on 2/25 and had x-rays done of legs. Results normal. Thought to have developed Achilles tendinitis. Possibly attributed to inflammation in legs, doctor wasn&#39;t sure. Rough quote &#34;could it be from the vaccine, possibly, we just don&#39;t know.&#34; Have been doing stretches since which has helped the leg pain. Starting on March 12, I began to have pain in my left arm again, and ended up getting vertigo that evening. The arm pain persisted on and off from then on out, as well as occasional dizziness, which I treated with Dramamine. I did get an appointment scheduled with a neurologist in May that I still have. On March 25, I began to feel unwell, with a fever, dizziness, and a headache. That worsened into the evening, and I woke up at around 3 am with a high fever, that ended up going to about 103 F, and began vomiting around 4:30am on Friday, which persisted into the evening. On Saturday evening I began to feel better. With that recovery, the constant leg pain and frequent arm pain seemed to be gone, and has yet to return to the degree that it had been prior to that bout of sickness.  I do still occasionally get arm or leg pain, but it&#39;s minor and only lasts about 20-30 minutes at a time.

                                                Patient received vaccine in left arm (deltoid). Was in post vaccination observation area. About 5 minutes after the injection, while sitting in the observation chairs, the patient fainted and hit his head on the floor. Pharmacist and patient&#39;s father got him back up into the chair. Patient quickly regained consciousness, but felt nauseous and warm. Patient was given a little water. But could carry-on a conversation.  Patient vomited a little into a trash can. About 10 additional minutes went by. Patient was able to get up out of the chair and walk out of the facility with the help of his family. Patient had a little bit of bump on head where he had struck the floor, no bleeding occurred. No additional medical assistance was contacted at that time by the facility, family, or the pharmacist. Pharmacist called the patient several hours to after to see how he was doing, but did not get a response. The pharmacist left a voicemail. It is unknown to the pharmacist whether or not the family decided it was necessary to get medical follow-up or not after the incident.

Attempted to stop the chills by wrapping in several blankets, but only continued to feel colder and colder. Despite the chills starting around 11pm, fever did not present itself until around 1am, hitting 99.8°F by 1:30am. It was around this time that I took an ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which did not kick in until around 2:30am. Once the chills stopped, my hands and feet only got hotter, keeping me awake for an additional 2 1/2 hours.

When he stood up, he did feel like he needed to hold onto something to steady himself, had some tunnel vision, improved with sitting down and closing his yes and taking deep breaths. He felt warm at the time, not cold or clammy. His friend said he looked ghostly white, no flushing, no hives, no angioedema. No sense of impending doom. He did take Zyrtec the day that he received the vaccine.   He waited the 15 minutes after vaccine without symptoms, and had walked back to class by the time it started. Between the vaccine and symptoms onset, he denies eating anything, being stung by anything.   He told a friend about his symptoms, and he returned to the hospital via base taxi arrived at ER. Symptoms were still occurring about 60 minutes after vaccination when he arrived at the ER. In the ER, he underwent exam, was given oral Benadryl.  His symptoms of scratchy throat lasted for 2 days afterwards with some associated fatigue, post-nasal drip.  He denies other symptoms. No fevers or chills. Small amount of pain and a ?knot? at the injection site the next day, but minimal according to the paitent.   Denies hives, angioedema, SOB, wheezing, nausea/vomiting, no diarrhea, abdominal pain, nasal pruritus/congestion, ocuarl itching/redness, no syncope.   No h/o vaccine reactions before. No h/o passing out before at all, specifically not to needles, blood draws, or vaccines before.   No h/o venom or drug allergy. He does report a history of apple allergic reaction 1 year previous when eating a raw apple, felt his throat close within 15-30 minutes, no hives or other systemic symptoms. He took oral Benadryl and went to ER. He was given oral Benadryl, no Epipen. He followed up with his PCM regarding possible apple allergy and was told to avoid apples, but was never tested for apple allergy.

Patient appeared to understand where he was and what happened. He was given orange juice and remained sitting for another 15-30 minutes. Afterwards patient ambulated to pharmacy counter, received his vaccine card and was able to leave on their own.

After 20 minutes he was able to go to sleep but then it woke him up in the middle of the night and but after a day it was pretty much gone. Reporter is wondering if he should receive the second vaccine which is due on the Friday 18Jun2021. Reporter has a friend who had the exact same thing happen after the moderna shot. She went to the urgent care and was given ibuprofen. She wanted to know if her son really needs that second shot, he does not want him to get the second dose, if her son was in the age group that is immune after the second dose or not. Reporter requested to speak to team studying myocardia because son&#39;s health care. reporter don&#39;t think he needs the second shot for immunity because of his age and his lung linings something being inflamed his organs that scares him about his heart. He got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine about 2 weeks ago. reporter want to say 5 foot 9 and he&#39;s probably 160 maybe a 160 pounds I think so yeah it&#39;s either 155 or 160 he is not sure. he was thinking of taking him to get an antibody test, just to find out that he can get the second shot. Patient received treatment of Advil for Had a real severe sharp pain about few inches below his clavicle, reporter think he just took one pill. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included weigh was he&#39;s probably 160, weight was it&#39;s either 155 or 160 on an unspecified date, weight was maybe a 160 pounds lbs on.

Chest pain, squeezing in chest. Unusual but manageable and didn?t feel terrible otherwise,maybe slightly tired.  Tried leaning forward to make feel better.  Day 3 and 4 chest pain/heart squeezing continued and was bothersome and, went to Urgent Care this day  April 13th. EKG was a little abnormal and told to follow up with a cardiologist and take Advil.  The heart squeezing feeling continued.  Early morning hours April 14th very sick, excessive shaking (no fever), extreme nausea, faint feeling, dry cough (laying on bathroom floor).  Not much, if any chest pain at the time.  Went to ER.  Not much chest pain during ER visit but nauseous and shaking etc. Test were run.   Told that the symptoms were a delayed reaction to the vaccine and to follow up with a cardiologist because possible abnormal EKG and to take Advil as needed.  Overnight at home, no chest pain but an hour of the shaking and nausea returned but not as bad as before.  Over next couple days the chest pain/squeezing, slightly shakes and  light headedness would come and go and by 4-16 feeling pretty great.  The heart feeling mildly at most in the background but not debilitating.  Starting week of April 20th maybe 4-5 flare ups with chest pain and no pattern but not debilitating.  Could happen at rest.  April 27th bigger flare up more debilitating, had to lie down, heart squeezing  pain and maybe some wheezing when breathed in but not tightness in throat.  Lasted about 30 minutes.  Was just doing schoolwork with friends at the time so not under any physical or emotional stress at the time.  After this from April 20 to May 3rd feeling heart symptom mildly but not debilitating and could resume normal active life.  Had cardiology appt. May 3rd with nurse practitioner.  According to NP the 12 Lead EKG run that day correlated with abnormal EKG from ER.  Normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia Rightward axis Pulmonary disease pattern.  Incomplete right bundle branch block Abnormal ECG.  Given 4 lead heart monitor to wear for a week.  Also ordered a CV CT angiogram coronaries with calcium scoring.  The test could not be scheduled through them until July.  Also told could go on hiking trip out west and to stop and rest if felt pain.  For parents reassurance about hiking trip, had a second opinion over teleconference call with Dr., myocarditis specialist to confirm would be safe on hiking trip. Dr. said he should be good to go.  He said these heart symptoms related to the second vaccine could fade over time.  Hiking trip May 20th to May 30th.  Did fine with exertion and just a few small episodes of the chest pain, light headedness and maybe a little shaking but these were at rest.  Also, 4 lead heart monitor report was good.  Returned from trip May 30th and no chest pain or symptoms for approximately 3 weeks through June 17th.   June 18th went to urgent care for sore throat and ear.  Prescribed amoxycillin.  Took the amoxycillin and one Advil sinus, that evening had a heart squeezing episode return.  This was the first time in almost 3 weeks.  Did not take any more Advil sinus in case that caused the episode. Had another slight episode that evening.  Hiked next day June 19th and fine.  Then felt it slightly again after eating that afternoon of the 19th, also chest did feel a little tight all day.  Then felt it again that evening.  Still taking Amoxycillin as of today.

Very dizzy, blurry eyesight, not being able to stand up or hold my balance, my heart felt like it was doing weird things.

I took some Tylenol in hopes it would help but it got worse throughout the night. During the night, I couldn?t hardly sleep due to feeling really hot and achy. I felt like I had a fever but did not have a thermometer to check it. When I woke up this morning, I noticed I had a knot on my clavicle which I believe it to be a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. I was unable to go to my internship today due to feeling ill but I am feeling better now after sleep and medication.

I tried to lay down and warm up but by chills were extreme by the time I got in bed. They were so bad that I couldn&#39;t even hold my phone or drink water without extra effort. Then as I tried to sleep I started to feel really hot. I eventually went to sleep but woke up about two hours later feeling like I had a fever. I was hot and sweaty. During the night I woke up every two hours feeling this way, hot, and tired. Then at 6 am I woke up still feeling bad, but better. Now I had a headache that wasn&#39;t there before. I drank a lot of water and took advil. After a cold shower I started to feel a lot better.

When the pharmacist went to release him, he was pale, dizzy, and clammy. He stated that he did not feel good. The pharmacist fanned him to cool  him down. She also gave him a wet rag to wipe his forehead. He was given two teaspoonful of Benadryl 12.5mg/ 5ml. The patient stated that he was feeling dizzy and thought he was going to faint. The pharmacy called 911. The patient removed his jacket and mask as he was hot. The EMT arrived and walked him outside* I am not sure what happened after that

                                                Around 10pm, I was suddenly very tired and could not stop yawning. I typically am up until 12-1 most nights so this was out of the ordinary. While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

The  father wasn&#39;t surprised and said that it has occurred before with other injections/ blood draws. pt recovered within a minute or two and was lucid and reported that he was fine.

I went to check in on him at 10:50a at which point he was eating a candy bar and stated he was already feeling better. He stated he has experienced symptoms of low blood sugar before and this was similar to what he had experienced in the past - even though it was worse. He said he was already feeling better, but he wanted to get something else to eat. I told him to stay put till 11a to make sure he wasn&#39;t still dizzy. At 11a, he was still feeling better and we went to grab him a pack of barbecue chips. He stayed till 11:20a and was still doing ok and left. I called him at 1:30p and has still doing ok.

It was most comparable to the dull pain that I felt 1-2 weeks after breaking my arm. I had limited mobility due to the pain and the area around the vaccine hurt to touch. The pain gradually faded away after the first day and was completely gone by the end of the second day.

He stated that originally his entire left side of his face felt numb and was weak but it&#39;s been improving since that time, now only his lower face. He denies any other acute symptoms including fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or any other acute concerns. VS wnl. PE remarkable for weakness in V2-V3 distribution of face with some sensation loss in the V3 distribution of the left side of the face. While forehead is spared, this appears to be more of a bell&#39;s palsy that&#39;s resolving rather than an acute central process. During evaluation his symptoms completely resolved Will discharge home with return precautions. (released at 1411pm) 04/01/2021 12:13 BP: 115/70. MAP: 85. HR: 61. RR: 12. O2 saturation: 100%.

Around 11am I had pretty bad chills that lasted about an hour, along with minor nausea. Additionally,  throughout most of the day my heart rate was usually between 90-100 bpm, even while lying down and doing nothing.  Going to sleep on Monday night I woke around 3 times during the night with cold sweats. Waking up on Tuesday morning, my heart rate is still elevated, arm is still sore, but the fatigue isn&#39;t as bad. However, at around 9am on Tuesday morning I started to develop itchy hives and a rash on the back of my legs.  After the first dose I only had a sore arm, no symptoms like these, and I do not have any known allergies.

The diagnosis was confirmed by an ER doctor; he received prescriptions for oral prednisone and valacyclovir. He is due for his Covid Vaccine dose #2 this week on 04/21/2021; presented with Bell&#39;s Palsy. vaccine postponed pending review  of the website (Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC) from the CDC.  It clearly states that a history of Bell?s palsy is not a contraindication to Covid vaccination but does not state what to do for a case of Bell?s palsy that is temporally associated with the first Pfizer dose.  Should we give him the second dose, delay the second dose or not give it at all?  Please advise,

Later that day, Pt went into status epilepticus and had to go to the emergency room, which resulted in his being admitted to the neuroscience ICU for observation. He was discharged to home on April 8. Symptoms improved gradually and resolved by April 19 (day 26). Video foolow-up visit with neuro on 4/22.

                                                Chest Pain, Myopericarditis; From EPIC: From cardiologist healthy man who comes to the ER with left anterior chest discomfort for the last 36 hours or so.  Symptoms are made worse by deep inspiration.  Were improved following self administration of 600 mg of ibuprofen earlier today.  2 days ago he received his second COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer).  Following day he experienced arm pain muscular aches and pains severe discomfort of the right arm (injection site) later in the day there was nausea and vomiting on one occasion (nonheme).  By last night he was able to eat dinner but subsequently felt short of breath with worsening chest discomfort morning the left arm continued to ache with musculoskeletal pains.  Developed more discomfort in the left anterior chest radiating to the throat made worse by deep inspiration. Does not describe typical sharp catching pain of pericarditis.  No cough sputum bruising bleeding abdominal pain change in color or character of bowels.  Sign in the emergency room he was hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm with a normal EKG.Torrey work-up notable for an initial troponin of 1.28 and a follow-up troponin of 2.14. Chest x-ray perfectly normal. Elevated d-dimer. CT angiography negative for pulmonary embolism vascular injury, cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion but the radiologist did note thickening of several right posterior and lateral axillary lymph nodes raising a question of recent right-sided vaccination or injury/infection to the right arm. Presently he is perfectly comfortable able to take a deep inspiration with mild chest discomfort, breathing easily.  I met him in July 2018He came to the emergency room with a 3-day viral syndrome manifested as headache nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal discomfort and then developed chest discomfort.  He was found with diffuse mild J-point elevation on EKG consistent with a viral type pericarditis with troponins which rose to a maximum of 10.4.  Work-up for myocarditis was negative.  Echocardiogram perfectly normal.  Symptoms responded to a course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine.  Seen in follow-up of repeat echocardiogram was perfectly healthy.  Our diagnosis was myopericarditis. There is no history of shortness of breath dyspnea on exertion decrement of exercise capacity peripheral edema orthopnea PND palpitations lightheadedness syncope or collapse.  No ill contacts.  He works in a high security position and therefore qualified for early administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  Graph past medical history notable only for the episode of myopericarditis and a remote tonsillectomy. There is no significant family history of sudden cardiac death or unusual heart disease. He takes no medications. Patient was recommended to take 4 weeks of ibuprofen and colchicine if needed for worsening chest pain.  Patient was recommended to follow-up closely with his primary care doctor and check ESR, C-reactive protein as well as renal function.  Needs close follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.

Both of my arms had a very tingly feeling and felt  heavy  and then became completely  numb and I was unable to move to either arm for approximately 45 minutes.  Movement slowly came back  throughout the evening and over the next week. My legs felt tingly and heavy. I continue to have periodic tingly feeling in my joints through out my body. My chest felt heavy.  I felt like I was doing to die.  Large red swollen area where shot was given. I have COVID 19 in Feb, 2021. Health care profession suspects the reaction may have been related to having COVID-19, second dose not recommended. Likely to have antibodies. I have not felt 100 percent since receiving vaccine.

                                                Patient received the 1st dose of the COVID vaccine (Pfizer Lot # ER8735 expiration date 07/05/2021) at 1547. At 1559, EMT noticed the client rubbing his arm in the location where he received the vaccine. EMT asked him how he was doing. The client stated that he was feeling &#34;tingling at the injection site.&#34; PHN  and EMT assisted the client to the zero gravity chair at 1600. The client sated that he was not feeling any other symptoms but he has had similar reactions after receiving the flu vaccine, and stated, &#34;my arm swells up, and gets stiff and it&#39;s hard to move.&#34; Client also stated, &#34;I&#39;m very afraid of needles.&#34; Skin around the injection site was the appropriate color to race and was free from erythema and discoloration. Vital signs were taken at 1601 (blood pressure 112/64, oxygen 96%, heart rate 88). Client stated at 1602, &#34;I&#39;m feeling hot now.&#34; Client removed his hat. PHN encouraged the client to drink his water, which he complied. PHN offered the client Benadryl at 1605, which he refused. At 1605, client stated, &#34;I do not feel hot anymore.&#34; Client has no medical conditions, and is not taking any medications. Client stated that he has no known allergies other than the reaction to the flu vaccine. At 1611, client stated that the &#34;tingling at the injection site was gone.&#34; Vital signs taken at 1611 (blood pressure 110/64, oxygen 97%, heart rate 88). Vital signs taken at 1621 (110/54, oxygen 97%, heart rate 80). Vital signs taken at 1629 (blood pressure 112/58, oxygen 97%, heart rate 75). Client stated at 1629, &#34;I feel fine now.&#34; PHN provided education to the client on when to seek emergency services, and to follow up with his primary care provider and to see an allergist before receiving his second dose. Client left the facility at 1629, unassisted and with a steady gait.

When the roomates didn&#39;t see him Monday morning, April 19, 2021, they went into his room and found him unresponsive. The medical examiner ruled death due to cancer which appears incorrect considering the evidence.

                                                The side effects didn&#39;t all occur simultaneously. Friday evening I noticed severe arm soreness. Later Friday night (about 10 hours after getting the vaccine) I developed gradual onset chills, body aches, and fatigue. Saturday I woke up with a severe headache, body aches, fatigue, and fever. The headache became severe by mid-day, with fatigue also worsening throughout the day.  Sunday was more of the same, though I believe the fever started inching down and the headache lessened. What developed Sunday afternoon/evening took me off guard though. I noticed a sudden drop in heart rate, a feeling of pressure and discomfort in the chest, nausea, and shortness of breath with exertion (consistently - not just once). (I&#39;m a long-distance runner, so this is unusual for me.) At first I debated going to the emergency room, but since I&#39;m so young and in otherwise good condition I thought nothing of it. I had similar symptoms the following day, but I avoided exerting myself until all of my symptoms from the vaccine had ended. I felt groggy and fatigued for several additional days, but by Saturday (8 days after getting the first dose of Pfizer) everything had resolved. I also developed swollen lymph nodes, which returned to normal size within about 3 weeks (before swelling again after the second vaccine).  The second dose of the vaccine caused a more sudden and intense reaction, though I never developed chest pain/slow heart rate with it.  Instead I developed sudden onset severe chills, fatigue, and body aches about 9 hours after getting the shot. A fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and sudden onset fever (temperature jumped nearly five degrees in about 90 minutes) quickly followed. My fever stabilized around 102.2 around 3 a.m. that morning, and slowly crept down throughout the afternoon/evening. Overall, with dizziness, body aches, extreme fatigue, etc., this was the sickest I&#39;ve been since I had a severe case of the Flu in high school. The fatigue, shortness of breath, and fast heart rate continued for about a week - getting slightly better each day.

                                                I had injection site pain about 4 or 5 hours after my injection. Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

The shoulder is well located. CTA starting at the heart demonstrate no vascular abnormalities. Assessment: unlikely that he has compartment syndrome or a cervical spine pathology. His exam does not localize to one specific innervation or muscle group. His paresthesias and diffuse 3/5 weakness on exam may be related to parsonage turner syndrome (post viral neuritis) versus edema. While he does have a cool hand and mild/moderate edema on exam, his CTA is normal and his exam is very reassuring that this is not compartment syndrome. He likely has rhabdomyolysis based on upper arm swelling in the setting of CK of 31924.   Discharge 2/22/2021: He received a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and was encouraged to drink large amounts of water. Repeat CK levels showed to be down trending as were his AST and ALT enzymes. Plain radiographs of his left arm and shoulder were unremarkable as was CT angiography of his chest. Electrolytes and renal lab work was within normal limits throughout the hospitalization.On the day of discharge, he was tolerating a PO diet, ambulating without difficulty, and hemodynamically stable. LUE w/ minimal swelling, no erythema. TTP over L triceps belly, No TTP over the distal LUE. Somewhat decreased sensation to light touch over distal LUE. 2&#43; radial pulses b/l. LUE ROM somewhat limited 2/2 pain, but intact. ---- to f/u with HCP in 2 weeks, sooner if worse (medical officer)   CK 2/22/21 was down to 14653

I just need some sugar like juice.&#34; He denied difficulty breathing or chest pain. He was not nauseous nor did he vomit. I transported him to a private holding room via wheelchair and gave him a 12 oz can of Coca-Cola. He took sips and immediately reported feeling better. The initial vital signs I took were as follows: Temp 98.6 F, HR 67, BP 84/48 mmHg, RR 24/min, and SpO2 97%.  After recheck in 15 min BP improved to 106/62 mmHg, his became more pink and no more diaphoresis. I observed him for 30 minutes total and he was stable to go home. He drove himself home.

                                                Got woken up by intense leg pain around 6:00am the day following vaccination. I took 1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen (split between 2 pills each containing 500mg methocarbamol and 200mg ibuprofen), and 1000mg acetaminophen before a hot bath which relieved pain enough to get back to sleep around 7am. I woke up again around 11am with similar extreme pain, took another set of  1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen , and 1000mg acetaminophen along with 5mg of hydrocodone left over from recent dental work. Pain subsided  until approximately 4:00pm when legs started to hurt again before getting to severe levels around 5pm (and so did the back of my neck which was the first neck pain experienced) so I took another set of 1000mg methocarbamol, 400mg ibuprofen , and 1000mg acetaminophen along with 5mg of hydrocodone  (which has helped ease discomfort again).   Leg pain is not sharp but very persistent and painful and is located behind both knees.  Neck pain was sharp and located directly at the back. I have had no arm pain or injection site swelling or pain, just leg pain and neck.   I did not experience any side-effects after my first dose, not even injection site pain.

I hear peoples voices in that buzz noise under their normal voice, almost like robotic. I don&#39;t know if this is related to the vaccine or not but I did notice it start the day after I got vaccinated.

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                About 6 hours post injection, with only a small amount of muscle soreness in the injected arm, I was suddenly very very dizzy. I ran from my living room to my bedroom and got under the sheets, I was very very cold. My whole body was twitching violently, and I had extreme muscle pain. Joints popped like knuckles cracking that I wouldn&#39;t normally be able to pop. This lasted for about 10 minutes very violently and then calmed down over another 10, and I just felt very very feverish. I felt numb all over but I was shivering a little. Moving was very hard and my whole back was very sore, with the injection arm in a little extra pain. Fell asleep until about 7:30 am, woke up still a little feverish. I have had waves of extreme dizziness and muscle aches continuing even to today a couple days later. I am also experiencing a rather persistent headache in the very center of my head, making it hard to think. I lose track of my thoughts and it feels like I can&#39;t focus, this seems to be improving gradually over time. treatment only included extra fluid intake and over the counter pain killers

It took him 3 days to fully recover from the seizure. He had a hard time thinking of the correct word and many strange thoughts and experiences. We called his doctor and talked to him over the phone. He told us to watch the patient for further problems.

                                                Vasovagal syncope in the 15 minute waiting period. Response by staff was great: laid me down, brought a cot, regularly checked my heart rate, blood oxygen, and blood pressure until it returned to normal and waited to make sure the symptoms did not return.   Later that night, I started experiencing some of the typical COVID vaccine side effects: sore arm, chills, nausea, and fever-like symptoms; in addition to the symptoms I was warned was possible, I also experienced periods of dizziness and an uncomfortable sense of balance. Three days later, the dizziness and other common symptoms have gone away, but my sense of balance still feels off, although I do not know if related to the vaccine. It?s not so bad that I?m at risk of falling over, but I have a semi-regular feeling of unsteadiness which I cannot explain.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

                                                On Saturday night (4/10) I had some chest pains that seemed to not go away in my upper left chest and left arm. I tried to sleep it off until the pain was unbearable at around 7:00 am on Monday (4/11). I then admitted myself to the ER and was given an ECG and multiple EKG?s as well. Upon lab results I had high triponin levels (28) leading the doctors to believe I had a heard attack of some sort, eventually they ruled it as acute pericarditis possibly due to my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

A 23-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 27Mar2021 (between 11:55AM and 12:00PM) (Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 via Intramuscular, at the age of 23-year-old, administered in right arm on 06Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6206, Expiry: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. He felt really terrible yesterday (07Apr2021). On Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well, and he could barely sleep last night (07Apr2021). His head felt heavy on Tuesday night (06Apr2021), and his head felt super heavy last night (07Apr2021). On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fatigue, on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow/throat pain, really bad headache, sensation of pressure in ear, sensation of pressure in eye, dizzy on standing, a little bit of nausea with the dizziness, really weak, he didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite, chills/teeth chattering, shaking, hot feeling generalized, sweating, feeling hot and cold. The patient experienced not feeling well on an unspecified date. Patient started developing symptoms that were very bad, he thought he had COVID. Patient had a PCR test that was negative. Patient would like to know if a delayed response after second dose is normal. Reported he had received his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose about 2 weeks ago (27Mar2021). He said he felt really terrible yesterday. He said he felt so bad that he thought he had the COVID-19 Virus, and went to get tested. He clarified he had a real time COVID-19 Virus PCR test yesterday (07Apr2021), and received a negative result today (08Apr2021), less than 24 hours after having the test performed. He said it could be something else that was making him feel terrible. He said he had a (telehealth) appointment with a doctor tomorrow (09Apr2021). Caller asked if Pfizer had any data with the second COVID-19 Vaccine for people that had a really delayed immune response with their immune system. He said he had no symptoms after his second COVID-19 Vaccine, and was wondering if what he was experiencing now was a delayed immune response. Reported last night was the worst for his symptoms, saying it was awful. He said he felt better this morning. He clarified that on Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well. He said his head felt heavy, but when he woke up, he did not feel too bad. He said he had fatigue, and on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow. He said last night (07Apr2021), he had a really bad headache, and his head felt super heavy. He said he had ear and eye pressure.

He said he was really weak, and didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite. He said he took his temperature at around 8:00PM-9:00PM last night, and had no fever. He said he still had his sense of taste and smell. He said he had chills, he was shaking, and his teeth were chattering. He said he was also hot and sweating at times, like he was alternating between hot and cold. He said he tried to drink water yesterday, and would take a few sips of water when he turned over in bed. He said he could barely sleep. Treatment: Reported he took Ibuprofen 200mg tablets, off and on, to treat his headache because his headache was preventing him from sleeping.

He said he took his first Ibuprofen dose in the middle of the night on Tuesday, and then took 2 more doses of 2 Ibuprofen 200mg tablets last night. He said he did not have the Ibuprofen 200mg tablet NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date because he had taken Ibuprofen from a different Ibuprofen 200mg bottle and put it in the Ibuprofen 200mg he was taking from. Reported he felt he had gained strength back today (08Apr2021) because he had showered this morning, and didn&#39;t fall over. He said he was so weak yesterday, even trying to text for his work was bad. He said his headache was a little worse today, and his left-sided throat pain was persisting, but everything else had subsided for now. Caller said he was wondering if what he had experienced was a delayed immune response, or a false negative COVID-19 Virus test, or something else, like Mono. Patient was not feeling well. Did test negative covid. The outcome of the event headache, Swallowing painful and Throat pain was not recovered, other events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Still felt a little cold. Head was hurting a lot. Slept better the second night. Awoke on Sunday with mainly head hurting and body aching a little less.

A 23-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient started doing this shaking, almost like a tardive dyskinesia effect or something. The reporter wanted to know if this was part of the side effects that people have reported. She has never seen him doing this before. The caller clarified that she was not sure if the tardive dyskinesia was new because he has been kept from her for a year due to COVID, so she doesn&#39;t know. She saw her 2 weeks ago and she noticed this behavior. She has never seen this before. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

But from that day until now I still get a weird feeling in my left chest. I feel like my heart is twitching sometimes. Sometimes I felt that my heart was pounding. Sometimes it feels like it&#39;s going to hurt my heart. It happened continuously about 5-6 times a day. Sometimes I was paranoid about it.

About 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine, patient complained of dizziness and some shortness of breath.   I did not see any swelling or noticeable difficulty in breathing.   Patient also complained of numbness and tingling on this hands.  Patient was told to be very relaxed on the chair in order to recover.  Patient then complained of losing sensation on his hands.  Also, patient said that he was going to pass out at any time.  Girlfriend was present with patient.  I told patient that I can call 911 immediately if they like.  We called 911 and within 5 minutes EMT ARRIVED.  EMT arrived and ran some tests on patient.  They said that patient &#39;s respiration was getting back to normal capacity and confirmed that patient was having an anxiety attack.  EMT asked if he has been taking medication for his anxiety.  Patient said that he isn&#39;t on any medication for his anxiety.  Patient  was then taken to the ER.

                                                My first dose of the pfizer vaccine was relatively asymptomatic. Received at local hospital. Sore arm that lasted a few hours, nothing too concerning.  This adverse event describes my second dose however, received Jan 23, 2020, approximately 3 weeks after the first. Again, this was received at local hospital. The next day, I felt the expected side effects of terrible chills, whole-body myalgia, and a slight fever. Again, I was not too worried as this was expected. I could not sleep that night, but otherwise, I felt significantly better in the morning.   Unfortunately, on Jan 25, 2 days after the second dose, I began to feel a strange tingling sensation in my forearms, and a pain in my lower back. This paresthesia felt as if the insides of my arms were vibrating, and rather than a &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensation, I felt electric shocks through my forearms and extremely discomforting tingles. I could not bend forward without terrible shocks through my arms, and my back pain can only be described as aching. I immediately scheduled an appointment with my doctor for Monday afternoon, That entire Sunday, it felt as if the tingling sensation, rated at 7/10 discomfort, grew to 10/10. I physically was wincing and turning, unable to find any position where my arms were not experiencing electric vibrations. My back pain, which was tender to touch, and if I pressed hard enough on it or laid on my back, caused the same electric sensation not just in the forearms but the entirety of my upper torso and my arm. Taking deep breaths was painful, as it elicited the same discomforting paresthesia. At the time, I was one of the first groups taking the pfizer shots, and it was still unclear if taking NSAIDs was a good idea to alleviate pains and the suppress the immune response. I agonized that entire Sunday and through Monday morning, the shocking expanding from just the forearms to the shoulders around the deltoid, and the back pain soon covered my entire upper torso. For whatever reason, waist-down I was completely fine. Even bending forward only elicited the pain upwards, nothing ever went down my legs. I had slight neck stiffness, a throbbing headache, intense back aches, bilateral upper extremity paresthesia, and pain on deep inspiration at the height of my pain on Monday morning. By this point, the pain had kept me awake for almost 30 hours.  When I finally could see my doctor via telehealth appointment, he prescribed me 800 mg ibuprofen to be taken every 6-8 hours I believe. After taking the ibuprofen, the pain lessened significantly, going from 10/10 to 2/10. I was finally able to go to sleep sitting up straight on a sofa chair. The paresthesia was gone, the pain on deep inspiration was gone, but the tenderness and dull ache in the lower back seemed to stay even on the ibuprofen. I noticed that if I laid down on my back to try and sleep, even with the medicine in full effect, the electric shooting and paresthesia would immediately return. If I quickly removed pressure from that area, it went away.  The ibuprofen&#39;s effect lasted only about 5 hours. I would take another as it slowly crawled back up to 4/10 pain or if the paresthesia was returning. Over the course of an entire week, I constantly needed to be on ibuprofen. By Friday, so almost 6 days after the shot, the paresthesia and back pain could be completely suppressed by the ibuprofen and I was able to lay on my back with no problems. Without medicine, I was sitting at a dull 3-10 back pain, but the paresthesia was gone. The back pain finally vanished on Sunday, 8 days after the shot, and I no longer needed ibuprofen. No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, radiation of electrical pain down the leg, vision change, or loss of bowel/urinary control throughout the course of these symptoms.  My experience reported to my primary care doctor, via our health messages. I did not return any contact to hospital or my vaccination site.

                                                Had a night fever at 3am on June 19. Felt hot, dehydrated, and weak. Took 200mg ibuprofen pill with water and slept again but was uncomfortable. Also felt dizzy and fatigue at night. My heart was also beating fast. When I woke up at 10am the symptoms seem to be less intense and better. I didn&#39;t feel hot. However, I still felt weak in my body. At 1pm when I started earing lunch I felt hot, tired and dizzy again, I was really sleepy, didn&#39;t feel like eating, and felt like vomiting. I drank coke soda instead and slept until 4pm and I took another 200mg ibuprofen pill with water, after which I felt better.

The symptoms were very noticeable at the onset, and around noon by the next day it was much more tolerable (though I had taken two ibupofen in the morning as I had a headache as well). The day after and two days after the shot, there was noticeable fatigue, though that could have been due to not getting much sleep the first night because of body temperature changes.

Confirmed diagnosis of Bell&#39;s palsy.  Started on Prednisone.  Only significant history was COVID-19 vaccination a few weeks prior (06/04).  He had some malaise and low grade fevers for several days after vaccination but then felt fine leading up to 06/19.  Unclear if any correlation but felt should be reported given there were cases of Bell&#39;s palsy in the clinical trials for mRNA vaccines.  Currently given Prednisone dosing for 7 days delaying 2nd vaccine.  Rescheduled from this Saturday to 3 weeks later.

A 24-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Jan2021 at 11:30am on left arm, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL0140) at right arm on 20Dec2020 10:30am for COVID-19 immunization. On 08Jan2021 at 12:00pm, the patient experienced facial droop 2 days after taking the 2nd dose of the vaccine. The patient went to the hospital for doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care and were advised to take Valtrex and Prednisone and told its Bell&#39;s palsy. Bell&#39;s palsy onset within 48 hours of second vaccine, R side of face. Wanted to confirm if there will be a problem once they take these drugs since the paient have just received the vaccine recently or wanted to know if the new medications prescribed will affect the vaccine&#39;s effectivity. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Facial droop/ Bell&#39;s palsy occurred 2 days after taking the 2nd dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine, a possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the event onset thus might not be fully excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

I waited for 30 minutes and was perfectly fine.  Around 5 pm I started to feel symptoms.  I got the worst aches in my entire body i&#39;ve ever felt before, along with chills.  I felt extremely hot, I took my temperature and had a fever of 102.3.  I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseas .  My head was throbbing.  I ended up taking 1000mg of tylenol to help reduce the fever, which seemed to really help.  I fell asleep and woke up the next morning drenched in sweat.  My fever was gone, but I still had a horrible headache and threw up from the nausea I was having.  It felt like I had a horrible hangover.

                                                Slight shoulder pain around injection sight; Mild discomfort; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 24-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EK4176; Expiration date was not reported) on 22Jan2021 (10:15) at a single dose, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Jan2021 (12:30), the patient had slight shoulder pain around the injection &#34;sight&#34; (site) and mild discomfort. The pain around the injection site had lasted roughly 48 hours, and then was getting more painful over time, then slowly getting better. The patient did not receive any treatment for the reported events. The outcome of the events, pain around the injection site and discomfort, was recovered in Jan2021. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination, and had not been tested since the vaccination.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

Around 6am I measured my axillary temperature to be 100.9 F and took 650 Tylenol once which broke the fever. I was unable to go in to work that day. Now, two days after the vaccine, my other symptoms have resolved aside from a painful, and visibly noticable, lymph adenopathy in my left arm pit the same side as the vaccine.

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

                                                got up about 5:15AM to use the restroom, parents heard a huge crash and we came running - he had collapsed and fainted in the bathroom, against the toilet, (with shelves and glass crashing down him - he grabbed the shelves and had a few cuts and bruises), was unresponsive, no color in his face, could not stand or move, could barely speak - slumped against the toilet.  Parents called 911 and tried to get him to respond, he was listless but opened his eyes - we lifted him and moved him to recliner in living room.  Fire Dept./EMT&#39;s arrived within a few minutes, blood pressure was 87/43, glucose was normal.  EMT&#39;s determined it was a reaction to the vaccine and asked if he wanted an ambulance or if parents should drive him for further care - he opted for us to drive him (his Mom called the Dr. on staff first - Dr. said it was a reaction to the vaccine and he should not get a 2nd dose).  Patient&#39;s Dad took him to Urgent Care - they ran an EKG (normal), and stayed there until his blood pressure showed (although still low)  normal/acceptable again.  I looked at the CDC website for covid anaphylaxis and it appears it was an allergic reaction (cardiovascular), on the site, he had these symptoms:  &#34;Cardiovascular: fainting; hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure); pallor.  ... Symptoms of anaphylaxis often occur within 15-30 minutes of vaccination, though it can sometimes take several hours for symptoms to appear.&#34;

A 24-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection, lot number: SH1555218 and expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 21Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing 22Q (diagnosed with this condition when he was about 4 years old). Immunodeficiency from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included rituximab (RITUXAN) taken for immunodeficiency, start and stop date were not reported. Patient states he received the 1st dose on 21Mar2021 about 9:00am or a little before that time and had a very bad side effect and was in the hospital for a couple of days. His weight was 162 or 163 pounds. Patient was immunocompromised and has issues regarding that lately and received Rituximab which is like a chemo; states after he had the Pfizer Vaccine on 21Mar2021, his arm that the vaccine was administered into got a little sore relatively soon after the shot and the main thing he was reporting that his platelets completely crashed which was the reason for the hospitalization (from 24Mar2021 to 26Mar2021). Patient states for the Rituximab he gets due to having some issues being immunocompromised, it was his 4th treatment with the Rituximab and states he has no lot numbers, dosages, expiry dates or NDC numbers to provide and states he was on the Rituximab for his immunocompromised status. His arm soreness was in the same arm that he had the Pfizer vaccine administered into and would say the following day after getting the Pfizer vaccine, he felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms that resolved completely like 2 days later and these symptoms went away. Patient was immunocompromised and has fairly serious health issues since he was age 4-5 and was able to get the vaccine with his HCP. Rituxan was the only medication he can think of to include in this report. Patient did not require a visit to the emergency room or the HCP office but was actually just getting the last dose of his treatment with Rituxan and then they drew his labs and the labs stated his platelet count had completely crashed the last time they checked his lab work. His platelet count was 3000 on 26Mar2021 and the platelets went up relatively quickly after that. Patient did not have treatment other than just the steroid of the very high dose Dexamethasone. Patient would like Pfizer&#39;s opinion and was not entirely sure he can get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and was asking what was recommended; patient aware that Pfizer was unable to offer medical advice or treatment recommendations and was referred to his HCP. Patient still on steroids very high dose Dexamethasone and got IVIG in the hospital; states he has no lot numbers, expiry dates, dosages or NDC numbers for the Dexamethasone or IVIG to provide. He has his patient card for the Pfizer Vaccine and states for the lot number, he thinks it was SH1555218 but does not locate other information including other numbers that could be the lot or the expiry date or the NDC number; states the patient card information was not handwritten and he can&#39;t tell what the lot number was and states this information was embedded like a bar code on his patient card. The outcome for the events platelets completely crashed, arm got a little sore was unknown and for events felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms was recovered on 24Mar2021.

                                                The first few days it was extreme muscle pain in my shoulder and arm. My arm was swollen for about 3 days, I couldn?t move my arm for almost a whole week. My muscles were very weak in the arm and hurt to put pressure on it and couldn?t lift my arm. It has gotten better but it has now been 3 weeks and I am still experiencing some muscle pain and weakness in my left shoulder. The shit was administered in my left arm  directly below my shoulder bone.  I still can?t move my arm to shoulder height or higher with feeling pain and weakness in the muscle.

                                                I experienced chills, which intensified in the evening into full body shudders before finally calming. Alongside this, I felt extremely sore, especially in the joints and feet, like they had or were being pressed or squeezed. This made it hard to move around or get out of bed. I also experienced a headache, and likely a fever.  I had similar symptoms after my first shot, but while those symptoms were still noticeable and took me out of work, I had a much stronger reaction this time around. I have been experiencing a sore neck and shoulders due to tension even until today.

Woke up at 11:30PM extremely cold and shaking, no fever. Was awake for about 45 minutes then slept for about an hour. Woke up again insanely hot and sweaty. Then I kept waking up every 30-60 minutes. Woke up for the day at 6:05AM. Had a headache, very bad body aches, brain fog, dizzy, fever, no energy. Spent the whole day feeling like this. Woke up the next morning at 6:05AM, still had a lot of body aches and a low fever. Also now had chest pains. It is now 11:30 PM and I do not have a fever but still have body aches and chest pains.

                                                Normal reaction the following day, strong fatigue, headache, nausea, arm soreness. Disappeared 36 hours later. 3 days later experienced heavy nausea, anxiety, gastrointestinal discomfort. Heavy bloating, inability to pass gas, loose stool/diarrhea all week. 7 days post vaccination symptoms came back, feeling of wanting to vomit, strong nausea, loss of appetite. 7-14 days later lost majority of appetite, eating aversion, heavy bloating, nausea and continuing diarrhea. Weakness, fatigue and shaking. Received Stool sample and blood test April 13. Elevated levels of albumin and red blood cell count. Doctor said it was most likely from dehydration. Zofran prescribed April 13 and only taken 2 days. Nausea subsided and ability to eat came back slowly. Since April 15th have been eating more food, but still have to force myself to eat. Hunger pangs rarely felt, only know when hungry when stomach churns and fatigue sets in. Today, April 28, still experiencing slight anxiety, loose stools once every other day, brain fog and depression. Lack of emotion, irritability and  periodic upset stomach still persist, along with appetite loss. Am able to eat filling meals again, but no appetite makes food less appealing. Failure to thrive still evident and feeling like I won&#39;t get better evident. Treatment during illness was minimal, urgent care did nothing other than prescribe zofran. Gastroenterologist and GP cannot see me for another 2 weeks.

A 24-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158; Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eye allergy. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AMOXICILINA CLAV) taken for eye allergy from 12Apr2021. On 14Apr2021, he received the first dose of the vaccine about an hour ago and waited five minutes and went to the bathroom. He had a severe reaction while patient was in the bathroom, he started to feel dizzy, had a terrible headache and chills. He walked out of the bathroom at the store and fell out completely in front of the pharmacists. The patient also experienced weak with shilling (as reported) and started sweating. The pharmacists called 911 and the responders checked his vitals and blood pressure and all of that and everything was fine. Patient clarified he passed out completely for almost 5 minutes. Patient stayed there with everyone until, they were waiting to see how he was doing. He reported he was feeling much better now, still feel a bit dizzy, not 100% but not as bad as when it happened. It has improved and he definitely felt terrible at the time. He was monitoring himself at home to see if he notices something weird going on. He does not have a headache right now and was feeling much better. When he was having the effect, he was mentally sharp, and knew what was going on. He thought about letting himself walk outside the bathroom so he could be seen. He didn&#39;t lose track of what was going on and body reacted adversely. He remembered stuff and everything and he felt good. Patient stated the chills went away; however, would not say they went away completely, he was recovering. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office and the paramedic said it was not necessary right now because all the vitals and everything else seemed fine. There was no therapy received for the events. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the vaccine and no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events feeling dizzy, terrible headache, chills was recovering; still feeling very sick was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

He said that he did not handle blood well. About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient stated that he was feeling like he needed to lay down. I laid him down in the booth area and obtained a BP 102/48, HR 43 normal cuff, supine position, left arm. Technician and I then elevated the patient&#39;s feet on a chair as the patient was appearing pale. Technician and I placed a ice pack on the back of the patient&#39;s neck as he was feeling hot/clammy. After about 15 minutes the patient was feeling much better and his blood pressure returned to normal - 108/55 HR 53, normal cuff, supine position, left arm.

We came out to assist and at that point the patient was already sitting up, but on the floor.  We were able to speak to him and gave him some water to drink.  We called 911, when we were aware he had fainted.  I was the pharmacist on duty, but not the one that vaccinated him.  So I stayed with him.  There was a moment when he took his sweater off saying he was hot, and I saw sweat bullets on his forehead.  So I got some paper towels for him and took his temperature, which read around 98 degrees.  A few seconds later he turned pale and fell over, hitting his head on one of the shelves.  I quickly got him off the shelf and held his head in my arms .  He opened his eyes and started talking and wanting to sit up, but we kept him laying down and continued to ask him questions to keep him alert.  He was able to answer the questions, knew where he was, who he was, who he was with .  The paramedics then arrived and he was taken out of the store on a stretcher.  We provided a copy of the report he filled out to the paramedics .

                                                About three minutes after the shot was injected, I started getting cold sweats.  About two minutes after that I started to hear a ringing in my ears.  This ringing got louder over the course of a minute and eventually my hearing was completely gone and I could only hear the ringing loudly.  As the ringing was at it&#39;s loudest, My peripheral vision started to go black and I nearly feinted.  Over about two minutes, I slowly had my normal hearing and vision return and the ringing in my ears got quiet.

His breathing rate remained normal so a decision was made to call the patient&#39;s wife, who is a nurse, instead of calling EMS.  The patient slowly regained consciousness approximately 10 minutes later.  His color improved somewhat, but he mentioned being tired and cold.  The patient went home under the care of his wife at approximately 3:50pm.

                                                Patient stated he felt nauseated and dizzy. When he attempted to stand up to move to the cot, he was unable to steady himself and he said he felt shaky, so RN, brought cot to him, and a few Admin staff surrounded him with drapes dividers. He laid on the cot to rest, legs elevated, and he stayed approx 30minutes. He said he was cold and he just felt &#34;off.&#34; Today&#39;s dose was his second, and he said he had no reaction to the first dose. He said he ate today. He drank an 8oz bottle of water. Cool pack applied to back of his neck. He said he felt nausous,and was unable to sit up after several minutes of laying down on the cot. After some deep breathing exercises, and resting, he began to feel a little better. RN brought his wife into the area from the car where she was waiting. Eventually, he said he was feeling steady enough to sit in a chair. RN&#39;s, B and D helped him out of cot and into a folding chair. After a few minutes, he said he still felt &#34;not like himself&#34; and the decision was made to go to the urgent care. RN D and worker assisted patient to the passenger side of the car. 1500: 124/90 P99  T98.3 R16  1515: 120/70 P67 T98.3 POx99% 1530: 120/78 P80 POx 99% R1

                                                Since my second shot of the vaccine, I have been experiencing chest pain. My chest feels tight and hurts a little bit. Any psychical  exertion causes the tightness and pain to increase a lot, like i&#39;m being stabbed by a knife.  If I go on a walk, it gets really bad and I start to feel it in my throat and back. It subsides if I lay down or sit still for a while. It seems to be caused by movement and exertion. Also, my left toe is now partially numb. It is not fully numb, but feels like pins and needles when I touch it. This has been happening since I got the second shot I think.

                                                I felt the typical symptoms after dose #2 the following day (Saturday, April 3rd, 2021) These symptoms included fever, feeling weak and having chills at night. However, those symptoms subsided by Sunday, April 4th, 2021. Instead, I began to have very odd chest pains that I have never had before. I went to the ER and they believed it was due to me taking too much ibuprofen for my fever symptoms which would give me heart burn and said it could be a symptom from the vaccine. The night thereafter I woke up due to an earthquake and felt the chest pain only much worse. I immediately went to the ER again.

I slept for a long time and woke up the following day with the standard arm pain but I also had extreme fatigue and a headache as well as a productive cough. That lasted for over 48 hours. On the third day I had fatigue, cough, body aches and a headache. I received a rapid  covid test on the 31st that was negative and the nurse practitioner said that she believed that I was either having a bad reaction to the vaccine or bronchitis or pneumonia. Last night I had all of the same symptoms as days prior as well as tightness in my chest and a obvious upper respiratory infection.&#34;

The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.

                                                I, the patient am reporting this after speaking with my neurologist today, after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine I starting experiencing excruciating migraines, migraines that felt like when I was NOT treated for my chronic migraines. Prior to the vaccine I had been stable on topiramate and was only experiencing about 1-2 migraines a month and was fine with sumatriptan. However, after the first dose of the vaccine I experienced muscle pain across my arms/shoulder/shoulder blades/neck that attributed to my head hurting. This pain has not subsided since the second dose but has decreased in its severity. Basically, the pain is still there, but it is not as excruciating. I am able to still go about my day, and I no longer have the arm/shoulder pain, but the migraines have not gone away. After speaking to my neurologist, he feels that the vaccine most likely triggered the muscle pain as that is a very common reaction which spiked the migraines to resurface, which is why I wanted to report this AE, especially because it has caused my prophylactic treatment (topiramate) and acute treatment (sumatriptan) to BOTH fail and I am needing to have my medications readjusted in order to deal with these migraines that have not subsided over the 3 weeks since the first vaccine. My neurologist feels that these migraines MAY subside, but he cannot rule out that they may never and I may need new/stronger therapy for them.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day of first pfizer vaccine (3/18/21), i woke up from a nap and my back hurt so bad that i couldn&#39;t leave the bed without falling out. My parents came and helped me out and gave me painkillers but really nothing helped. Next day, it started down my right arm (the arm NOT injected with the shot) and it started to hurt in my muscles everywhere and hasn&#39;t stopped to this day (3/25/21). Numbness and pins and needles feeling have occurred in my pinky and ring finger of right arm. Pain has now started in my knees as well after a few days from the shot. No pain killers work and I&#39;m unable to write or type properly, or even work at my job frankly. I can&#39;t hold an object without it falling out of my hand, and when i am able to hold something, after about 2 seconds pain fills my arm. Nothing helps the pain. I saw my primary care physician on 3/25/21 and the PA said there wasn&#39;t anything to do for the intense pain i was having except take tylenol arthritis, melatonin (to help me sleep through the pain), exercise (even though it may cause me even worse pain), and a stress ball for my arm. I don&#39;t know what else to do with this pain and this was only the first round of shots.

                                                Patient had just finished recieving his covid-19 vaccination from vaccinator. At the time of patients fainting I was mixing up covid-19 vaccinations when the technicians said we need you to come out here because a patient is having a seizure, When arriving on the scene I found patient unconsious on the floor face down, while assessing the scene I noticed some blood on floor. I tried to look for any trauma, patient was breathing and I tried to awaken him. I told someone to call 911 and contact a store manager. Then all of a sudden he popped up and sat up like nothing happened. I then noticed the brusing on his nose and asked for an ice pack and a bottle of water. Patient knew his name, was coherent, and seemed to be fine. I stayed with patient until paramedics arrived. Paramedics did a thorough examination and everything checked out. Patient waited for parents to arrive instead of going with paramedics. Vaccinator stayed with patient till his parents arrived.

My manager rushed to catch him from falling and I assisted in steadying him. He was breathing erratically, excessively diaphoretic, and his muscles were twitching frequently. His eyes were dilated and he became unresponsive. Fearing a seizure, we lowered him to the floor and turned him on his side. He became responsive and coherent again approximately one minute later and was speaking to us normally. Paramedics arrived several minutes later and took over care. He was taken to the hospital due to abnormal vital signs.

                                                On Wednesday April 14th I got my second vaccination shot. The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.

                                                I had some of the expected side effects described on the fact sheet (for my first dose 3 weeks prior I didn&#39;t have any side effects besides some slight arm soreness). I didn&#39;t notice any significant symptoms for about 11 hours following my 8:45am 2nd dose on the 26th. Then in the evening I started getting a fever, chills, soreness in the legs in addition to existing arm soreness. The fever got up to about 102 F I believe around 10-11pm, at which point I took 200 mg ibuprofen. I slept for most of the next day when possible, and the fever dropped to a bit above 100 F before rising slightly in the evening. Still had chills (shivering, teeth chattering). I took another 200 mg ibuprofen that evening. As of today (28th) the fever is gone and, besides a mild headache, I feel much better.

                                                25yo male patient fainted about 5min after receiving the vaccine while sitting in an observation chair. He fell to the side off his chair and hit head on the concrete floor, with his body still on the chair. Patient had convulsion-like movements. It was unclear if it was seizure-type activity or if his body was struggling to sit up from the supine position laying on the chair. Patient was attended to immediately by pharmacist  - he responded immediately to my talking to him and touching his shoulders. Patient was guided to an upright seated position, then helped to floor and asked to lie on floor with legs elevated. 911 was called and Seattle Fire Dept arrived about 5min later. Patient was fully aware of surroundings, his name, etc. Evaluated him and took multiple blood pressure readings with him laying on floor and eventually sitting up. His pressure was initially low but recovered to normal over 15-30 minutes. Ambulance was called but patient declined as his parents were on their way. Patient&#39;s blood pressure recovered to normal and he was able to sit and stand, was fully conversational throughout the episode. Patient left building of his own accord with his family to seek medical follow-up.

                                                The arm that I received the vaccine in (Right Arm) Has been falling asleep if I hold it still, in as little as 10 minutes.  This hasn?t been too big of an issue while awake, But in my sleep last night I woke up around eight times with my arm completely dead limp and getting no blood circulation.  I had to move it around with my left hand for a while to force blood circulation before I could move my right arm again. I would then do little blood circulating exercises with my right hand and arm until it felt normal again, Then I would go back to sleep. I was sleeping on the opposite side (on left arm or back) So there was nothing else that could?ve been cutting off circulation. This is not something that?s normal for me. I spoke to a nurse at the site that administered the dose, and she advised me to call back and get an appointment with a nurse if the problem continues in my sleep tonight.

                                                9 hours after the shot I started to feel really groggy and sore with my left arm hurting. 12 hours in I started to feel like I had a fever so i checked it and it was 102 degree F, I was also unable to pick my left arm up due to the pain and my whole body hurt a lot. 13 hours in at about 10 pm that night I started full-body shaking violently and needed help from my parents into my room because I could not walk because my legs were wobbling so much. I felt lightheaded and the shaking continued for about 20 minutes. During this time I checked my temp again and it was 105 degrees F. Once the shaking stopped the fever and intense pain continued until 2 am when it dropped down to 102 degrees F and I was able to fall asleep. The next morning I woke at 8am with a temp of 100 degree F with the same all-over-body pain that lasted all day but the fever dropped until that night. That night it came back at 100 degrees F.  This cycle lasted from when I got my shot on the 1st until 4th when the fever stopped. The pain has subsided around the 6th. But I am currently still having pain in my left shoulder where I got my shot today on the 8th.

                                                I got shingles about a week after my second Pfizer COVID shot. It first presented as aching/pain in my right leg for about a week, and then several rashes/blistery areas appeared down the back of that leg which hurt in a burning &#43; sharp pins way. I called my insurance&#39;s virtual urgent care line and the doctor diagnosed me with shingles and put me on a course of valacyclovir. We discussed possible triggers, but I had no major stressors or illness or anything else that would have caused shingles - so the doctor and I agreed that it was likely triggered by the COVID vaccine. I had chickenpox as a child and have never had shingles before. I&#39;m a couple days into the antivirals but expect it will take a while for this to run its course.

Stopped taking notes since. Doctor had me take a blood test (see below) as well as referred to a neurologist for an EMG.  5/4-5/26: I&#39;ve since been on some extra vitamins (b12 and d, as my b12 was on the low side but not outside the recommended range and d was also low) and have not seen any decrease or increase in symptoms. Some days are better than others. My right eye has stopped twitching, but I continue to have it throughout my body in my arms, back, legs, feet, left eye. I&#39;ve been on an average diet since the beginning of march.

I hope you stop misleading the public and communicate that myocarditis and severe inflammation IS 100% A SIDE EFFECT THAT IS CAUSED BY THE VACCINE RESPONSE. I know because I am experiencing it, and you&#39;ve ruined the last 24 days of my life. Thank you.

                                                Pt is a 25M with PMH of GERD, ADHD, obesity who presented to the ED on 5/11 for chest pain. That morning he had noticed increased substernal chest pressure associated with palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis, and left arm tingling. He notes that early last year he was very sick and though he had COVID but confirmatory testing was not available at that time. After recovering from the illness he noted that he had occasionally episodes of chest pressure and palpitations. However yesterday was the worst his symptoms have ever been. He did receive his 2nd COVID vaccine this past Saturday and experienced fatigue, nausea, weakness.  In the ED patient has HD stable, afebrile, saturating well on RA. Labs were notable for troponin of 5.2 which trend down to 3.1. ESR WNL, CRP elevated 2.4. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with signs suggestive of possible pericarditis. CXR negative. CTA showed no pulmonary embolism, enlarged and prominent left axillary lymph nodes, nonspecific, cholelithiasis. Patient admitted for NSTEMI. Enlarged axillary lymph nodes likely reactive in the setting of recent COVID vaccine.    Cardiology consulted. Patient underwent cardiac cath which was unremarkable. Cardiology recommends short course NSAIDs for possible pericarditis, however EKG changes unimpressive per cardiology. Discharged home on ibuprofen 400 mg TID for 5 days. Advise follow up with PCP within 1 week.

It is currently 6 weeks later and I have fatigue, shortness of breath, head pressure, double vision, cannot concentrate for any length of time and dizziness/unsteadiness.  I have not been able to go to work since the vaccination and have people helping take care of me.  I cannot take a shower without being short of breath after.  I have been put on 2 different rounds of steroids ? the 2nd more aggressive, which did not make a difference.  I have been to my general doctor several times, an allergist and a neurologist.  I have had extensive bloodwork, an MRI, and an EKG ? all were normal.  My symptoms have not improved at all in the past 3-4 weeks.

                                                Over a month after receiving my second dose of Pfizer, I had an episode of lightheadedness, dizziness, shakiness, and fatigue. I attributed it to dehydration and laid down and ate a snack, I began to feel better after 1-2 hours. A week later I had another lightheadedness incident that sent me back to bed (this one being slightly worse). I experience slight chest pain in my upper right chest muscle. It took me a day to recover from this spell. I constantly felt weak and as if I was about to faint. I went to the doctor two days later and got blood work done and measured my blood pressure. Everything came back normal. On Saturday June 19th, I had another near-fainting experience in a public setting. My hearing changed, I couldn&#39;t think straight, I was very shaky and weak, and I tried to drink a lot of water. Nothing helped so I went home and once I got in bed I was aggressively shaking. Since then I have been bed-ridden for the week, and unable to do normal activities such as go for walks, exercise, or go to work. I am going to visit a cardiologist tomorrow.
