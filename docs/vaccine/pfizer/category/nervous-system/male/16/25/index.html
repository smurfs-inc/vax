                                                seizure like symptoms; Dizziness; lethargy; fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist.  A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of intramuscular BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Mar2021 at 12:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 16-year-old. Lot number was EN6205. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. On 02Mar2021 at 12:00, the patient experienced Dizziness, seizure like symptoms, lethargy, fatigue. It was unknown if the patient was treated due to the events. The patient recovered from the events in Mar2021. It was unknown if the patient had COVID prior vaccination; it was unknown if the patient was tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Seizure cannot be excluded.

A 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: E13249), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 15Feb2021 11:00 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was Adult Residential Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included developmentally disabled, seizures, malaria at birth.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

I took a warm shower thinking the house was just cold, but when I went to bed after I started shaking with chills. I didn?t sleep well that night and during the day Thursday (01/21) I felt feverish and a throbbing headache. I tried sleeping throughout the day, still having the chills come and go. I took ibuprofen before heading the bed the next night and slept great other than feeling a little hot and sweaty. I showered the next morning and felt 100% again.

                                                Side effects manifested after second dose as a migrane in the early morning (~4:30 AM). Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

These spasms lasted until roughly 8am and were strong enough to rattle my 300lb bed frame. The only treatment I could think of at the time was to get as warm as I could so i covered myself in 8 blankets and just waited it out. It is now noon and the chills/spasms seem to be gone.

He described the symptoms of his skin turning red, shaking, and swelling in his throat as swelling in the past. He indicated that he had needed to use an epi pen in the past for his allergy.  He still wanted the vaccination and knew we had an epi pen handy.  He was given the vaccination in his left arm and was set up next to the staff development employee who was timing and monitoring patient&#39;s for symptoms. An epi pen was given to the monitor so it would be handy.  The patient&#39;s right hand started shaking within a minute and it was hard to tell if it was from being anxious.  Patient continued to communicate verbally and stated he wanted to use the epi pen.  911 was called by the staff and the staff member with the epi pen took it and the patient out of the main area. Paramedics transported him to the hospital with slight tachycardia and never did administer epi pen while in facility. Patient was always conscious and able to verbally communicate.

                                                Symptoms started during bedtime and woke me up. Began with severe full body chills and full body muscle shaking and weakness during the night of 1/5 and early morning of 1/6, around 1000 to 0200. Slight headache began during that time as well.   Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

I took some Tylenol in hopes it would help but it got worse throughout the night. During the night, I couldn?t hardly sleep due to feeling really hot and achy. I felt like I had a fever but did not have a thermometer to check it. When I woke up this morning, I noticed I had a knot on my clavicle which I believe it to be a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. I was unable to go to my internship today due to feeling ill but I am feeling better now after sleep and medication.

                                                I had injection site pain about 4 or 5 hours after my injection. Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

                                                About 12 hours after the vaccination, I felt the &#34;headrush&#34; of a fever in my face behind my nose and eyes. My body was not warm like a fever so I did not take my temperature. However, I had a lot of difficulty sleeping that night because it felt like my body and immune system was revved up. It was impossible for me to get comfortable.

The shoulder is well located. CTA starting at the heart demonstrate no vascular abnormalities. Assessment: unlikely that he has compartment syndrome or a cervical spine pathology. His exam does not localize to one specific innervation or muscle group. His paresthesias and diffuse 3/5 weakness on exam may be related to parsonage turner syndrome (post viral neuritis) versus edema. While he does have a cool hand and mild/moderate edema on exam, his CTA is normal and his exam is very reassuring that this is not compartment syndrome. He likely has rhabdomyolysis based on upper arm swelling in the setting of CK of 31924.   Discharge 2/22/2021: He received a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and was encouraged to drink large amounts of water. Repeat CK levels showed to be down trending as were his AST and ALT enzymes. Plain radiographs of his left arm and shoulder were unremarkable as was CT angiography of his chest. Electrolytes and renal lab work was within normal limits throughout the hospitalization.On the day of discharge, he was tolerating a PO diet, ambulating without difficulty, and hemodynamically stable. LUE w/ minimal swelling, no erythema. TTP over L triceps belly, No TTP over the distal LUE. Somewhat decreased sensation to light touch over distal LUE. 2&#43; radial pulses b/l. LUE ROM somewhat limited 2/2 pain, but intact. ---- to f/u with HCP in 2 weeks, sooner if worse (medical officer)   CK 2/22/21 was down to 14653

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

                                                On Saturday night (4/10) I had some chest pains that seemed to not go away in my upper left chest and left arm. I tried to sleep it off until the pain was unbearable at around 7:00 am on Monday (4/11). I then admitted myself to the ER and was given an ECG and multiple EKG?s as well. Upon lab results I had high triponin levels (28) leading the doctors to believe I had a heard attack of some sort, eventually they ruled it as acute pericarditis possibly due to my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

A 24-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Jan2021 at 11:30am on left arm, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL0140) at right arm on 20Dec2020 10:30am for COVID-19 immunization. On 08Jan2021 at 12:00pm, the patient experienced facial droop 2 days after taking the 2nd dose of the vaccine. The patient went to the hospital for doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care and were advised to take Valtrex and Prednisone and told its Bell&#39;s palsy. Bell&#39;s palsy onset within 48 hours of second vaccine, R side of face. Wanted to confirm if there will be a problem once they take these drugs since the paient have just received the vaccine recently or wanted to know if the new medications prescribed will affect the vaccine&#39;s effectivity. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Facial droop/ Bell&#39;s palsy occurred 2 days after taking the 2nd dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine, a possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the event onset thus might not be fully excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

                                                platelets completely crashed; arm got a little sore; felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms; felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (reporting on himself). A 24-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection, lot number: SH1555218 and expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 21Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing 22Q (diagnosed with this condition when he was about 4 years old). Immunodeficiency from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included rituximab (RITUXAN) taken for immunodeficiency, start and stop date were not reported. Patient states he received the 1st dose on 21Mar2021 about 9:00am or a little before that time and had a very bad side effect and was in the hospital for a couple of days. His weight was 162 or 163 pounds. Patient was immunocompromised and has issues regarding that lately and received Rituximab which is like a chemo; states after he had the Pfizer Vaccine on 21Mar2021, his arm that the vaccine was administered into got a little sore relatively soon after the shot and the main thing he was reporting that his platelets completely crashed which was the reason for the hospitalization (from 24Mar2021 to 26Mar2021). Patient states for the Rituximab he gets due to having some issues being immunocompromised, it was his 4th treatment with the Rituximab and states he has no lot numbers, dosages, expiry dates or NDC numbers to provide and states he was on the Rituximab for his immunocompromised status. His arm soreness was in the same arm that he had the Pfizer vaccine administered into and would say the following day after getting the Pfizer vaccine, he felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms that resolved completely like 2 days later and these symptoms went away. Patient was immunocompromised and has fairly serious health issues since he was age 4-5 and was able to get the vaccine with his HCP. Rituxan was the only medication he can think of to include in this report. Patient did not require a visit to the emergency room or the HCP office but was actually just getting the last dose of his treatment with Rituxan and then they drew his labs and the labs stated his platelet count had completely crashed the last time they checked his lab work. His platelet count was 3000 on 26Mar2021 and the platelets went up relatively quickly after that. Patient did not have treatment other than just the steroid of the very high dose Dexamethasone. Patient would like Pfizer&#39;s opinion and was not entirely sure he can get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and was asking what was recommended; patient aware that Pfizer was unable to offer medical advice or treatment recommendations and was referred to his HCP. Patient still on steroids very high dose Dexamethasone and got IVIG in the hospital; states he has no lot numbers, expiry dates, dosages or NDC numbers for the Dexamethasone or IVIG to provide. He has his patient card for the Pfizer Vaccine and states for the lot number, he thinks it was SH1555218 but does not locate other information including other numbers that could be the lot or the expiry date or the NDC number; states the patient card information was not handwritten and he can&#39;t tell what the lot number was and states this information was embedded like a bar code on his patient card. The outcome for the events platelets completely crashed, arm got a little sore was unknown and for events felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms was recovered on 24Mar2021.

The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.

It has been 3 days and this headache had not resolved. I have been on tylenol  Q6-8 hrs and ibuprofen in the AM.  In addition, I experienced on and off chills, fatigue, and malaise. This headache has been very concerning and i hope it will eventually subside
