                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The vaccine was administered to the writer at 0800 on 1/5/2021. No immediate reactions were noticed for the 30 minutes observation period immediately after. The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

He described the symptoms of his skin turning red, shaking, and swelling in his throat as swelling in the past. He indicated that he had needed to use an epi pen in the past for his allergy.  He still wanted the vaccination and knew we had an epi pen handy.  He was given the vaccination in his left arm and was set up next to the staff development employee who was timing and monitoring patient&#39;s for symptoms. An epi pen was given to the monitor so it would be handy.  The patient&#39;s right hand started shaking within a minute and it was hard to tell if it was from being anxious.  Patient continued to communicate verbally and stated he wanted to use the epi pen.  911 was called by the staff and the staff member with the epi pen took it and the patient out of the main area. Paramedics transported him to the hospital with slight tachycardia and never did administer epi pen while in facility. Patient was always conscious and able to verbally communicate.

                                                Symptoms started during bedtime and woke me up. Began with severe full body chills and full body muscle shaking and weakness during the night of 1/5 and early morning of 1/6, around 1000 to 0200. Slight headache began during that time as well.   Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

                                                I started feeling achy around 9:00 pm and felt like I was going to get more ill. I took some Tylenol in hopes it would help but it got worse throughout the night. During the night, I couldn?t hardly sleep due to feeling really hot and achy. I felt like I had a fever but did not have a thermometer to check it. When I woke up this morning, I noticed I had a knot on my clavicle which I believe it to be a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. I was unable to go to my internship today due to feeling ill but I am feeling better now after sleep and medication.

By 8:00am I had developed a severe headache, severe nausea, muscle fatigue and overall felt bad. When I got home I had become extremely nauseous and developed severe muscle fatigue and severe arthralgia and my headache had increased and became sweaty and dizzy. I slept from 9:00am to 2:00pm where the symptoms had gotten no better and the headache had gotten worse. I slept from 3:00pm to around 6:00pm with the same symptoms but managed to eat some soup and kept it down. I slept from 10pm to 12pm the next day 12/10/20. My fatigue and joint pain had somewhat dissipated but I was still experiencing severe nausea and a severe headache. By the end of 12/10/20 around 8pm my joint pain and muscle fatigue had gotten better but the nausea and headache were still there. 12/11/20 I was well enough to drive and receive a covid test. My nausea and headache did not go away until the end of day 12/11/20

Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

My body was not warm like a fever so I did not take my temperature. However, I had a lot of difficulty sleeping that night because it felt like my body and immune system was revved up.

Around hour 10, a fever of 100° F set in and quickly rose to 102° before hour 12. Fever reached 103° by hour 12.5 and broke by hour 13. After fever broke, vomiting/dry heaving occurred for roughly 2 hours. Lethargy/ LOC set in around hour 16 and the former remained until around hour 48. After the course, I began to feel fine, I just wanted to report how adverse my side effects were compared to those of my coworkers.

Severity is moderate. Quality dull pain. Currently involves entire left arm (arm, elbow forearm wrist hand).. Did have some swelling and motor loss, NO CP, SOB or sensory loss, no redness, no injury, no fever, chills, ha, depression sore throat, cough, rash, lymphadenopathy, abd pain, GI distress, no trauma or recent illnesses. 2/21: admitted clinic w/rhabdomyolysis: no preceding workouts, increased activity on ship, back sleeper, no alcohol, no trauma,. nsp: skin intact, no erythema. Mild edema to upper arm around triceps. Mild purple discoloration to dorsum of hand. Palp: TTP about triceps. TTP anterior shoulder. TTP biceps. Able to palpate triceps tendon and biceps tendon. NTTP throughout the rest of hand and forearm. Hand is cooler relative to contralateral side. NTTP cervical spine. ROM: Full passive ROM of the shoulder and elbow with pain. No micromotion pain with any joint in the upper extremity. Painless cervical spine ROM. Motor: 3/5 strength to OP/FPL/2nd FDP, EIP/EPL, 1st and 2nd DIO. 3/5 deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors. Sens: Decreased sensation throughout entirety of forearm and hand distal to the elbow. Above the elbow, sensation is intact. Vasc: 2&#43; radial pulse, symmetric to contralateral side. BCR &lt;3 sec. Hand is cooler than contralateral side. Lab: CRP &lt;5, ESR 4, CK 31,924, PT 14, INR 1.1, D-dimer 0.46, AST 610, ALT 186, Cr 0.94, WBC 6.3 Imaging: Radiographs of the chest, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand demonstrate no fracture. The shoulder is well located. CTA starting at the heart demonstrate no vascular abnormalities. Assessment: unlikely that he has compartment syndrome or a cervical spine pathology. His exam does not localize to one specific innervation or muscle group. His paresthesias and diffuse 3/5 weakness on exam may be related to parsonage turner syndrome (post viral neuritis) versus edema. While he does have a cool hand and mild/moderate edema on exam, his CTA is normal and his exam is very reassuring that this is not compartment syndrome. He likely has rhabdomyolysis based on upper arm swelling in the setting of CK of 31924.   Discharge 2/22/2021: He received a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and was encouraged to drink large amounts of water. Repeat CK levels showed to be down trending as were his AST and ALT enzymes. Plain radiographs of his left arm and shoulder were unremarkable as was CT angiography of his chest. Electrolytes and renal lab work was within normal limits throughout the hospitalization.On the day of discharge, he was tolerating a PO diet, ambulating without difficulty, and hemodynamically stable. LUE w/ minimal swelling, no erythema. TTP over L triceps belly, No TTP over the distal LUE. Somewhat decreased sensation to light touch over distal LUE. 2&#43; radial pulses b/l. LUE ROM somewhat limited 2/2 pain, but intact. ---- to f/u with HCP in 2 weeks, sooner if worse (medical officer)   CK 2/22/21 was down to 14653

The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.
