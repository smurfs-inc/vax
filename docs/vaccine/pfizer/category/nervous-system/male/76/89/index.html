A 76-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history reported as none. Family history included wife who passed away 2.5 years before, on an unspecified date and his daughter and her (daughter) son, who lives with the patient, tested positive for COVID virus. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced little bit of fever, allergies, and feeling unwell, but described as not horribly bad. Patient stated he is ok and doesn&#39;t think it has anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. He stated that he thinks it is just allergies due to the pollen. Patient was taking two to three Ibuprofen once or twice a day when he goes to sleep. He has been perspiring quite a bit at night, which he stated was ok. Aside from that he was pretty much ok. He doesn&#39;t get second dose until 15Feb2021. Stated we have come a long way from beginnings of time where people would just die. He asked if he should get tested. Patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician. He stated his symptoms began in the evening of 16Jan2021 at 8pm. He started getting a little feverish and sluggish. He took three Ibuprofen. He thought he lost some weight with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Weight was between 169-170lbs on 16Jan2021. The patient operates a daycare center with children. He was not taking any medication except for the Ibuprofen. He is very active and runs a business. Only thing is, he is sad because he does not have his wife with him. He stated everything was fine. He wanted to know if it was possible one can get the COVID virus even with the injection. He asked about the second COVID-19 Vaccine and what does the first dose do. Treatment included ibuprofen for little bit of fever, sluggish, and Feeling unwell. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of fever, sluggish, weight decreased, night sweats and feeling unwell  due to temporal relationship  Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject drug contributed to the event of pollen allergy, which likely represent intercurrent medical condition.  There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician reported for self. This 76-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 04Jan2021 10:50 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EK5730) for covid-19 immunisation. None additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included ongoing Cardiac disorder from Jun1990, Type 1 diabetes mellitus from 2000, Heart Attack from Jun1990. Concomitant drugs were none. He said he has a question. He stated he got his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on 04Jan2021 and woke up 9 days later on 13Jan2021 with Bell&#39;s Palsy, which was medically significant. He said he was not sure if he should get his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot that was scheduled for Monday, 25Jan2021. He asked if Bell&#39;s Palsy has been a reported side effect of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he refuses to take steroids for the Bell&#39;s Palsy. He said he had an incident in 2019 where he was prescribed steroids for an arthritic condition, and he ended up septic. No treatments were received. Outcome of the event was resolving. Drug result by physician was related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported Bell&#39;s Palsy cannot be excluded.

                                                On Saturday 2/6/21 in the morning on the left side under  armpit felt like he had a pulled muscle or something. It eventually radiated over up into the left quadrant of his chest where he could not push down on it.  It was extremely painful by Monday.  He has a history of esophageal spasms and exacerbated them to where he thought he was having a heart attack.  He called his Cardiologist and told him to go to the ER.  He went to the hospital Monday evening, he had two EKG&#39;s, had blood drawn 3 times, did sonograms looking for blood clots.  He did inform them that he had the vaccine on Friday and they told him it was due to that.  He went to nuclear medicine to get his lung checked for blood clots as well.  All tests were negative.  He saw his PCP today who told him that the lymph nodes were affected due to the vaccine.  He has improved greatly, still has some slight discomfort which his PCP said would go away in time.

                                                I developed stomach, intestinal pain, cramps. A continuous aching with a sharp pain about every 20 - 35 minutes. Lasting  36 hours. This was in my lower abdomen below belly button on the left side. Really quiet frightening, in that this was not in any material regarding side affects. I considered the emergency room  Saturday night but didn&#39;t t go. Began to subside Sunday afternoon, leaving me sore to the touch. Only a little tenderness remains in the area. I have seen no physicians. I cannot speak to any permanent damage.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 18Jan2021 at 14:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization; and ibuprofen (ADVIL; Strength: 200 mg, Lot Number: DC5474, Expiration Date: May2022), via an unspecified route of administration,  on 18Jan2021, at 400 mg, single, as premedication. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s wife was told by a nurse to give ibuprofen before the patient&#39;s first shot. So, the patient&#39;s wife told the patient to take ibuprofen before the COVID-19 vaccine shot and he took two 200 mg ibuprofen before the vaccine. The patient&#39;s wife feels guilty because she doesn&#39;t know if the patient is protected or not. The patient&#39;s wife gave the patient two ibuprofen before the COVID-19 shot. On 18Jan2021, the patient felt a bit tired and his arm hurt a bit, but he was fine the next morning (19Jan2021). He only felt a little tired that day and the next day, he felt great. It was further reported that the patient&#39;s wife gets allergy shots from a nurse, and the nurse told her to take ibuprofen before the COVID-19 vaccine shot. The patient never takes ibuprofen and the patient&#39;s wife can&#39;t believe she told him to take it. She had a friend who said ibuprofen could minimize the effectiveness of the shot. So, she was asking if the patient should have another shot since he took ibuprofen before his vaccine. It was a very bad advice because the patient&#39;s wife just learnt she shouldn&#39;t have. The patient&#39;s wife wanted him to have a little reaction as she thinks the vaccine is not going to be effective; asked if the patient should take an additional shot.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL9262, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Jan2021 15:30 at a single dose for protection from the virus at the Physician Office. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2011 and ongoing. The patient also thought he had a Covid respiratory infection in Feb2020. He had a prolonged moderate to severe respiratory infection. He thought at first that he had the flu, but he had a flu shot. He thinks he had Covid. He had antibody studies in May2020 (last spring) that were negative. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient previously had influenza vaccine (flu shot). The patient reported hypothermia after getting the first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. On the same day of vaccination (26Jan2021), he had injection site tenderness. The next day, (27Jan2021), his arm was suddenly painful; he began to have chills 29 hours after receiving the vaccine (27Jan2021) and was shaking. He also had a temperature of 93.7 orally, confirmed with two different digital thermometers. He took his temperature with a new electronic thermometer that he purchased at a pharmacy. His temperature was 92.7 on 27Jan2021. He repeated it with another electronic thermometer. The first evening (27Jan2021), his temperature went to 96.5 to 98 degrees. Then it went down to 93.2 degrees. He covered up with blankets and his temperature increased and the chills stopped. He stated that this was hypothermia. He had low temperatures the following day (28Jan2021) as well, his temperature was 93-94 degrees. His temperature was 93.7 degrees. Other times he checked his temperature and it was 96.5 degrees. When his temperature was low the first time, it only lasted for about three hours. The second time it happened he went to bed and covered up. It lasted for an hour or two. He noticed it again two days ago. The patient also stated the arm he received the injection in was tender however progressed to mild to moderately painful when he experienced the chills and low temperatures. The arm tenderness after getting the vaccine was very mild. He noticed it when he rolled over on his arm. He took some Tylenol for it. His son is an internist. He said the hypothermia was medically significant. His son also said hypothermia is equivalent to a fever in the elderly. The patient wanted to know if there have been any reports of hypothermia after the administration of the vaccine. He has concerns about this occurring after the second dose. He is scheduled to receive the second dose on 15Feb2021 or 16Feb2021. The outcome of the event hypothermia was recovered on 30Jan2021 and pain in arm recovered on 27Jan2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown. The events hypothermia, arm pain and injections site tenderness were assessed as related to BNT16B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported hypothermia and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.

                                                Following Dose 1,  Right Arm became sore at injection site for 4 days, at which time Right armpit became very tender touch and was swollen about size of silver dollar, approx. 1/2 inch thick.  Soreness at injection site subsided over the next 17 days, but tenderness in armpit only diminished slightly.  Following Dose 2, Right Arm was once again sore at injection site for about 4 days, but tenderness to the right armpit became more pronounced, with swelling increasing to the size of a hockey puck.  Size of swelling was easily visible to the eye.  Armpit became more tender to the touch, and has diminished only slightly in size,, as of this reporting.  Mass remains soft to the feel, but easily defined in size and location.  I have taken OTC pain killers to help with the discomfort.  Will continue to monitor its progress, unless notified otherwise.  Do not anticipate seeing my physician at this point.  Have consulted the Web, and have noted that this is a lesser side effect of this vaccine, if swelling remains localized to the injection site.  Thought I should report this side effect only because of the size of the swelling that occured.

By mid-afternoon had to go to bed and slept for hours. Got up at 9PM and went back to bed at 11PM. Sunday was better, but this AM (Monday) awakened with itchy skin, pins and needles on hands and feet (gone now) and total exhaustion. Had difficulty breathing (better now), can barely lift arms and had to miss work and went back to bed. I am reporting this because I am scheduled for a 2nd shot on the 26th and not certain it&#39;s a good idea.

                                                Almost immediately felt swelling at the injection site, which I felt as being normal.  Next day when I woke up felt a slight headache , abnormal vision issues that included sparkles, blurred vision and a general tiredness. Did not feel refreshed as I normally do when I wake up in the morning. As the day went on sparkles and vision issues remained and headache got worse. Went to bed earlier than normal and next day when woke up the symptoms got worse, I felt like I had a migraine. Vision issues persisted. Laid down around 11AM and took a nap and when I woke up I noticed a blotch in my left eye reminiscent of the shape of a fish (looked like a shark) and it had different colors. Bright yellow and black almost kind of an iridescent green and orange. The shape was still just the colors were different.  I panicked and called the optometrist and explained what happened. They wanted to see me right away. I was able to be seen in the afternoon. They looked at it, did two tests and came with the diagnosis of a branch retinal artery occlusion.  I visited my neuro- ophthalmologist on 01/28 and he confirmed the diagnosis had previously given.  He then ordered fedrate and a couple of other tests. They also did a visual acuity in the left eye (20/30) and color vision (8/8 normal) and color plates and intraocular pressure (16 OS)

                                                Awakening  on Saturday, March 13, I saw blood on my pillow and a pee spot on the bed (my first time for either).  I could barely get out of bed (an awkward rollover did it).  My tongue was numb (still is) and raw from the presumed chewing on it.  Walking was slow and painful as all muscles hurt.  If I sneezed or coughed, my back would hurt.  Those last problems are still true. I periodically cough up phlegm and lacking a good place to spit it out, I just swallow it.  I have for the first time in my life been using a walker for stability. Right arm is almost useless due to pain.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

A 77-years-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3246), via an intramuscular route of administration in the left arm on 28Jan2021 at 9:30 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included low iron from unspecified date to ongoing (diagnosed about two years ago). Concomitant medication included iron infusion taking for about 2 years, they cannot seem to straighten it out, states it is uncurable. He had too many red blood cells due to bone marrow, he got on iron infusions, and if his red blood cells gets to high, then they will perform phlebotomy to have them taken out. This was his second year receiving the infusions. He goes in once a week and they test him and sometimes he was able to get the infusion and sometimes he had to wait till the next week. Stated they took a pint of blood out of him about a week and a half ago. He goes every Thursday and his red blood cell count was 15.7. The weight of the patient was 205-206. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 28Jan2021, the patient had no problem with his arm, not really too many problems at all, except after he got home, the back of his left leg above the knee and back of his calf feels a little weird, tender. Stated he had a crazy feeling on the bottom of his heel, it was killing him, he can barely walk, he did not have this prior to getting the vaccine. He was worried about getting the second dose. Advised to contact hcp. Him and his wife have their second shot scheduled for 28Feb2021. He was told that it can be given up to 4 days ahead or anytime after. He read that Pfizer recommends 21 days between doses The feeling in his heel has stayed the same. States he slept ok. He does had a bad back. When he woke up and tried to put the weight on his left leg he can walk a couple of steps and his heel was killing him. Pain shooted up his leg. It was hard for him to walk. The back of his knee and calf are not really that bad, but he can feel it, he can barely walk. Caller asked have there been any reports of this and how long does it take for the pain to disappear. Caller stated the clinic where they received the vaccine told them the second dose can be scheduled 4 days before 21 days or a week or so after 21 days. Caller also asked if that was going to cause a problem if the second dose is scheduled 28 days after dose 1? they responded saying that &#34;The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination series was 2 doses given 3 weeks apart. This was how Pfizer-BioNTech studied the vaccine. Provided disclaimers that Pfizer was unable to speak outside of the EUA fact sheet and Pfizer was independent of a company guidelines and recommendations. He hoped the heel pain was going to go away and it was something from the vaccine, not something else. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

A 77-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 77-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 26Jan2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EL9263) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included penicillin allergy. It&#39;s been 25-30 years ago and he can&#39;t take it. He gets swollen and hives and sick. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received a shingles shot about 5-6 years ago and flu shot Nov2020. The patient experienced soreness in the arm on 26Jan2021, back pain on 30Jan2021, so he thought it was just a pulled muscle on Feb2021, shingles on 15Feb2021. The patient received the first COVID shot on 26Jan2021 and didn&#39;t really have a reaction, but soreness in the arm a couple of days. He then started having back pain and he is a very active person so he didn&#39;t think anything of it. Spouse told him that he needs to see the doctor because she thought he had shingles. They do not know if it&#39;s associated to the COVID shot or not. They need to also cancel his appointment for tomorrow because the doctor does not want him to get his second COVID shot since he is on medication for the shingles. Mentions again, his arm was a little sore, but then 4 days after that he had back pain. He is an exceptionally active person, and excavation construction worker and still works and so he thought it was just a pulled muscle. Then a few days later, pain was awful and area was sensitive to touch and it looked a little swollen and he had nothing else. A couple days later he kept saying it bothered him and it was all the way around to his side. It was fine at first it started with a little rash and so he went to the doctor today and diagnosed with shingles. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of shingles which included valacyclovir (Was given Valacyclovir 1 gram tablet to take three times daily to help the shingles). Adverse events required a visit to Physician Office. The outcome of the event &#34;soreness in the arm&#34; was recovered on 28Jan2021, for Back pain and shingles was not recovered, for &#34;so he thought it was just a pulled muscle&#34; was unknown. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problem with vaccines in past.   Follow-up attempts are completed.

                                                I had no reaction for approximately 4 hours after my vaccination. Then I got the shakes and all the muscles in my body seemed to be vibrating. I could still walk but found a comfortable chair. The shakes would rise and fall in amplitude causing my hands and legs to oscillate then recede after about 30 seconds.   This lasted for about 20-25 minutes and simply went away and has not recurred. I have had no other symptoms.  As chills were a listed side effect, I assumed at first  that it was chills or some variant but I was not cold. It was the chills without an apparent temperature effect although I did not measure my temperature.

                                                perfuse sweating; mild tenderness of arm; Muscle pain; Chills; Weakness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).   A 78-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) intramuscular at single dose at left deltoid on 11Jan2021 around 13:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history was none, he was basically healthy. There were no concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks), but the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose exactly 3 weeks before 1st dose on 21Dec2020 for covid-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. The patient began to have muscle pain, chills, and weakness about 8 hours or so after the 2nd vaccine on 11Jan2021. He states these symptoms have maybe gotten a little better, but have been continuing on for 2-3 days now. He is also experiencing perfuse sweating during 13Jan2021night. Right now, he was not experiencing this. Maybe a little bit, but not much. The caller experienced mild tenderness of arm on 12Jan2021: he explained when you press his arm, it hurts a little bit. No events required a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of muscle pain was and perfuse sweating was unknown, of chills, weakness was recovering, of mild tenderness of arm was not recovered. The patient was his own primary doctor. The reporter considered all events as medically significant and he believed these symptoms are related to receiving the vaccine because he stated he was okay before that.   No further information expected. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event muscle pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.

(His 2nd is scheduled for 3/3) He started with sx ~13 hrs later - He started drifting out of consciousness, then had labored breathing through night rendering him unable to sleep. After getting up in the morning, his breathing was better but he felt lightheaded/weak through the day. By the next morning (Friday 2/12), he was so bad next morning that wife called 911 - He reports that he was there and then not there and was losing track of train of thought. He was taken to ER via EMS, where his HR was initially 15 - He was admitted to hospital - initially a temporary pacer was placed, then a permanent one on Monday, 2/22. He has had other episodes like this in past 13 mos. PCP referred him to neurologist and EENT. Neurology work-up, including MRI and 72 hr EEG were unremarkable, although he learned retrospectively that there was a time during EEG where HR was only 35. EENT found no auditory or other issues . *MD in ER told him that if issues were not neuro in nature, they were probably cardiac.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EM9809/expiration date: not provided), via intramuscular route of administration, on 04-FEB-2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 78 years old) 0.3mL as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included patient was diabetic since an unknown date and has psoriatic arthritis. Concomitant medication included infliximab (REMICADE) infusion every 8 weeks for psoriatic arthritis and cetirizine hydrochloride (EQUATE ALLERGY RELIEF). The patient had infliximab infusion the morning of 04Feb2021, prior to receiving the vaccination and was told that infliximab would not be a problem with receiving the vaccination on the same day. On 07Feb2021, the patient went to the emergency room due to Bell&#39;s palsy, which was described as swelling of lips, nose, mouth, and side of face and stated that he can&#39;t talk very good because his lips are swelled up/hard to talk and his eyes have been bothering him and he is blinking. The patient stated, &#34;I went to the emergency room at a hospital and what they said is totally unrelated to the COVID shot I got. In the meantime, few days after I had the shot, I had somehow got Bell&#39;s palsy caused the side of my face to swell up and droop on one side. I just wanted to get back to you so you knew that was not some reaction to the COVID shot, it was something else.&#34; Treatment for the event Bell&#39;s palsy included took Allergy Relief Equate 25mg ultra tablet and another allergy pill and it did not help swelling of lips, nose, mouth, and side of face. Relevant tests included blood work on an unspecified date in 2021 &#34;two weeks ago&#34; that was all good. The outcome of the events Bell&#39;s palsy, eyes have been bothering him and he is blinking and hard to talk was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                He received his vaccine, and immediately he could taste it in his mouth.  About 5-6 days later his normal routine was to work outside and noticed that he had lost his energy issue, and had this issue in the past when his pacemaker was out of wack.  As the month went on it got worse and worse.  In March he was out cleaning up the yard and as he worked it got worse and worse.  He would have to work for 5 and sit down for a minute.  He has hyperventilation syndrome and diagnosed back in 1980 and has been under control, this is one thing that always happens, which seems to be an ongoing problem that he&#39;s having.  His settings on his pacemaker seem to be OK.  He was sitting on his couch and watching a race on 3/8/21 and got a shock coming up from the bottom part of his head, through his chest and out through his right eye, this was less than 2 seconds.  This was an event, but not a hard &#34;mule&#34; kick event.  He wasn&#39;t doing anything to get the shock.  The defibrillator is connected to the bottom part of his heart.  He has a logic system and had an episode of 190-200 BPM which was at the top part of his heart.  He had all of his equipment checked out yesterday, but they could not give him an answer why he got a shock.  He now has to set up an appointment with his cardiologist to see tomorrow.   He has had the pacemaker for 6-7 years now and the device goes into the device clinic and he gets reports regarding this information.   They device people said there was no registration that he had any event.

                                                3 days after second Pfizer shot right foot swelled up with pain. Two days later pain shot up right leg and to hip.  Intense pain for about 5 days similar to when I had back surgery about 27 years ago.  Since then leg and hip pain subsided but my right foot still feels swollen and painful at night and in the morning.  Gets better temporarily walking on it during day but feel like there is a stiff pad below the skin on my foot .  Had a similar reaction with second pneumonia shot in October where I got spasms in lower back and then right leg started to collapse but only lasted then for about 5 minutes with no long term effects/

A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 intramuscular, administered on right arm on 03Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9261) at single dose (at the age of 78 years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history included had vascular problems in his legs, and his legs were very clogged. The doctors couldn&#39;t do anything and tried to do a catheterization. Thyroid was not okay, and now his doctor increased his thyroid medication. The reporter blamed the hospital for doing something wrong when her husband was there the last time. She said the hospital made a mistake and gave her husband the wrong medication. She said the first time her husband was at the hospital, the hospital didn&#39;t give her husband his thyroid medicine. She said the second time, the hospital gave her husband the wrong dose of medication. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) dose 1 on 10Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient previously took flu vaccines in Sep2020. On Mar2021, the reporter&#39;s husband was okay at first. She said now her husband had diarrhea and pooped in his clothes. She said her husband was very weak and lost his appetite. She clarified her husband&#39;s symptoms started probably 2 weeks ago, and her husband was worse, and like a different person now. She said her husband used to eat at the table, and now he just sits in his chair, and after 5:00PM he wants to go to bed. She said she was not sure if her husband&#39;s symptoms were related to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her husband was supposed to have heart bypass surgery on Monday (22Mar2021), and his surgeon called on Saturday night (20Mar2021) and called off her husband&#39;s surgery. She said the surgeon said her husband had a collapsed lung. She said her husband had a chest x-ray in late Feb2021 and his lungs were clear. She said everything that happened to her husband, happened after he had his second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was not sure if her husband&#39;s collapsed lung (19Mar2021) was related to his second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said before getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, her husband did not have a problem with his lungs. She said her husband&#39;s surgeon can&#39;t figure out why her husband&#39;s lung collapsed. She said she can&#39;t prove his collapsed lung was a side effect of the COVID-19 Vaccine, but her husband never had sick lungs in his life. She said she knows her husband doesn&#39;t have the COVID-19 Virus because he had to be tested on Saturday (20Mar2021) for the COVID-19 Virus before he could have his surgery on Monday (22Mar2021). She said her husband&#39;s COVID-19 Virus test was negative Saturday, but he has all these problems. The patient&#39;s wife was afraid to give her husband Pepto Bismol, so she didn&#39;t give her husband anything. She said her husband has an appointment on Thursday (25Mar2021) with his primary care doctor to talk about his symptoms. The outcome of collapsed lung was unknown and other events were not recovered.

                                                Patient had second dose of Pfizer vaccine in morning. That afternoon began complaining of abdominal pain with subsequent vomiting (x2) and possible diarrhea. Patient could not sleep that evening . Awoke next morning with continued abdominal pain throughout the day and ultimately was found unresponsive in bed. Transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Subsequently autopsy was performed which revealed significant pre-existing hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with evidence of acute myocardial infarction. There is no clear evidence that this is related to the vaccination, however it is being reported due to potential public health interest and temporal proximity to vaccination.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). I couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately. put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination. He died at 5:30 a.m. on April 1, 2021.

On third day after second vaccination,  should symptoms gone but I started to develop diffuse myalgias.  By 4th day, began having problems with my memory. I could not figure out some instructions on a computer program. I had some trouble recognizing a common object in my hand.  Then mild ataxia.  Excessive sleepiness in 2-3 hour intervals.  On 8th day, developed  abdominal pain similar to diverticulitis. And became very constipated. I had forgotten to take the Parnate and missed two doses. I had forgotten to take Metamucil and Miralax. these led to the constipation and abdominal pain.  On advice of psychopharmacologist, I resumed Parnate  and started to feel better.  I resumed laxatives and good effect. Abdominal symptoms abated in two additional days.  I had gone to ER  but seen only informally by my medical friends. After 3 hour, and getting better, I left.   Blood tests were normal.  No exam.   Since 02/27/2021, I have felt perfectly normal.   Recovered.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports, reporting for self. This 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) via unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID virus in Aug2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM and got a reaction around 9 PM. The patient stated a lot of the same symptoms from the COVID virus came back after the vaccine. The first thing was chills, patient took a couple of paracetamol (TYLENOL), and they went away after about a half hour. The patient had a low grade fever 101.9 at 29Jan2021 night to 30Jan2021, and took paracetamol then as well. The patient reported the biggest thing was everything hurt including muscles and head. Patient felt weak, more or less tired with no energy following the vaccination. The symptoms were from 29Jan2021 night until probably 31Jan2021 morning noon, then he started to feel little bit better. The patient hardly miss work, but missed work on 30Jan2021. The patient stated feeling pretty good and pretty much back to normal on 01Feb2021, it did not affect breathing or cough, just fever and feeling lousy. The patient commented that he can relate to COVID because he had had the COVID and for 2 weeks he was like that. He also had the breathing problem with the virus in Aug2020, and he think he had every symptom but did not lose taste or smell. The patient asked if he should take his second dose of vaccine. The outcome of event chills was resolved on 29Jan2021. The outcome of event fever was resolved on 30Jan2021. The outcome of other events was resolving.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. ; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021148753 same reporter/drug/events, different patients

A 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 19Jan2021, at single dose, to prevent COVID, at a hospital. Medical history included lung cancer (19-year lung cancer survivor), mild heart attack in 2011, aortic valve replacement in 2013 and a heart issue. Concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included influenza vaccine received on 06Nov2020 for immunization. The patient reported that on he had the first vaccine shot on 19Jan2021 (10 days ago) and on 20Jan2021, when he raised his left arm where the vaccine was given, he felt a twinge of pain where that was, and a kind of numbness, it was nothing that restricts him in any way, but when he exercised in the morning and lifted his arm over his head he felt the twinge of pain, which was something he never experienced with the flu vaccine or any other vaccines. He wondered if it had something to do with this vaccine. He has not treated it, it has not bothered him much. He stated he feels it when he exercises it and swings his left arm, then he feels a bit tightness or a twinge of pain. He says it does not restrict him or cause him to cry out or anything. The patient also reported that he is scheduled for the second dose on 09Feb2021 and stated that he needs to get a dental procedure done on 04Feb2021 and needs to take amoxicillin for it due to past heart issue. The patient wanted to know if it is okay to take amoxicillin and was wondering if this medication will interfere with the second dose. He also asked if he should cancel the dental procedure. The patient mentioned that he had his annual wellness visit on an unspecified date and they did a lipid profile (unknown results) but it was not relevant in his opinion. The outcome of the events was unknown.

There is another number here, I think it D-6152061100.&#34; Medical history included a heart disease (A-Fib) (Intent: History) for which the patient takes Eliquis, losartan ,metoprolol and pravastatin and a heart condition. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS), losartan, metoprolol, pravastatin; all for A-Fib. Caller (patient) stated &#34;I receive my first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. I felt really tired (in Jan2021) for a week after receiving the vaccine. I have a heart disease (A-Fib) for which I take Eliquis, losartan, metoprolol and pravastatin.&#34; He noticed a slight increase in his blood pressure and heart rate post vaccination. He had the tendency to monitor his blood pressure and heart rate on regular basis but had been monitoring closely post vaccination. His normal vital signs were around Blood pressure:120/70 to 80 and Heart Rate: 50 -60. However he noticed his BP was high as 139/95 (in 2021) and heart rate 95-103 (in 2021) which is not his normal. His blood pressure is steady now but pulse is always elevated. On 11Feb2021 patient stated &#34;Started to feel very weak. My blood pressure had gone up; Blood pressure was 139 over 95. Heart rate almost doubled: 97 heart rate. Patient stated, &#34;I took the COVID first shot and my age is 79. I took the first shot of the COVID Vaccine on 28Jan2021, around 1 pm in the afternoon at the vaccination facility (a 2 year college, they were doing it outside of the college). I think I had a reaction to it (in 2021). Normally my blood pressure is 110 to 125 on top and I don&#39;t know 65 up to 80 on the bottom and my heart is normally between 50 to 65. That&#39;s my normal heart rate. I am pretty healthy and I do a lot exercise and lot of power walking, so my heart rate is &#39;not so&#39; low. That afternoon (28Jan2021) I walk, my power walk training miles. I started to feel very weak and at night I took my blood pressure it wasn&#39;t too bad. It was 139 over 78 with a 61 heart rate and then next morning I woke up and my blood pressure had gone up to medically and heart rate almost doubled. Next morning (29Jan2021) at 10 am my blood pressure was 139 over 95 and a 97 heart rate. It kind of continued, I have been writing this all down and monitoring it and blood pressure has come down to some degree but my heart rate continue to be elevated but my blood pressure like this morning, I do in January because I have heart condition and I have Afib (Intent: History). I took the Pfizer vaccine.&#34; I am scheduled to get the second dose on the 18th and I am concern about the elevation of my heart rate and elevation of my blood pressure.&#34; Outcome of event &#39;tired&#39; was recovered in 2021; &#39;Blood pressure raised&#39; was unknown; &#39;Heart rate increased&#39; was not recovered; &#39;feel very weak&#39; was unknown; &#39;I think I had a reaction to it&#39; was unknown.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, dose 2, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostate cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and major radial prostatectomy from 04Feb2021 to an unknown date. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced chills, low grade fever and fatigue. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of BNT162B2. The patient was fine, had no problems until 15Mar20201 (4 days afterwards), the patient stated, &#34;I started getting chills, shaking uncontrollably , nausea, fatigue, a little bit of everything. I wouldn&#39;t be calling you but this has not subsided. It&#39;s been 3 weeks now and I&#39;m not feeling well. It ebbs and tides. I&#39;ve been taking a diary. I went to the ER last Monday because I was wheezing in the morning and had shortness of breathe in between all the other symptoms. They did all kind of blood tests, covid test which was negative, chest x-ray showed bronchitis. Blood work and ultrasound of my bladder with unknown results. They sent me home with a inhaler, steroid and an antibiotic and every day since then it seems like at night 9, or 10 o&#39;clock I start feeling better and sleep through the night. My fever is 97.7 degrees fahrenheit but about 2, 3 or 4 o&#39;clock my fever ticks up a little and I start to feel lousy, my stomach feels. I feel like I have hot flashes; a feeling of warmth with achiness and lack of appetite. So I take my Tylenol 7 or 8 o&#39;clock at night my temperature is 97.7F. I haven&#39;t had 1 good day since. I&#39;ve been to my doctor, ER, I&#39;ve talked with the CDC. What information do you have for people who have had long term symptoms/side effects? What am I supposed to do? Someone from Pfizer needs to give me advice. If not I&#39;ll go to  the news network. I don&#39;t feel well. It&#39;s directly related. No one has given me relief or help. It&#39;s impacting my life. I&#39;ve been sick every day.  Is there someone above you who can tell me what to do? I took their (Pfizer&#39;s) vaccine that was recommended. It was your vaccine. Not mine. Someone has to have an answer for me. Unless you want to go and have lawsuit and the news. Just think about it, if you had to go through the symptoms of having the flu everyday. Please relay this to someone. If I don&#39;t heard back within a week, then I&#39;m going ballistic. It&#39;s not going to be pretty. Someone has to get back to me to help. I want someone to tell me that I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m not the only experiencing this. There has to be an answer. I took your vaccine. You are responsible. I want to know. I can&#39;t be the only one in the whole world who is feeling like this. I&#39;ve been to the ER and the doctors. I&#39;ve had every side effects but theirs go away in a few days, but mine hasn&#39;t. I need advice, that I&#39;m not nuts, something that will help me get better. I want to feel better. It&#39;s effecting my family my life. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd? I can&#39;t be the only one? Someone has to know something. They (drug companies) like to hide the facts. I am sick because I took BNT162B2 vaccine. I need someone to get back to me.&#34; After the second dose of BNT162B2, the patient has been experiencing an achy feeling, heat throughout the body, shivering, shaking, trouble walking, and some fever.

Half of his face went numb and they feared the patient had a stroke. They rushed the patient to urgent care where it was determined it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and NOT a stroke. The patient is back home and recovering well.

The patient received bnt162b2 yesterday, with no problems. However today (18Jan2021), in 15 minutes after waking up at 11, he had the chills really bad, that went away, then he went to sleep again and woke up and he had all the symptoms on the paperwork, he had dizziness, headache, he&#39;s hardly ever had a headache ever. He had aches and pain. Caller states that he was just asking right now about another company, and their vaccine in started with an M, and her daughter is at a girls home, because she has a epileptic type thing, and this particular shot, that started with M, the nurse called over, and the problems that he is having he explained to the nurse is like when he had the virus previously about in Jul2020, when he had the virus he was in hospital for a week, because he had to get rid of the virus, and they got him out of that. Now he took this shot yesterday and the next day is when he got all these symptoms, he&#39;s tired, cant walk, muscle pain, had chills not any more, pain in the knees, everywhere really, he couldn&#39;t get any position to go back to sleep, his back knees elbow joint pain. Since he had these things, the nurse at the girls home, told his wife if having these problems he can take 300 mg of Zinc, 1000mg of Vitamin C, and 2000IU or Vitamin D, the same thing, that amount, he asks will it over come the symptoms. Another person felt good after getting those, it helped him he does state however that is what the person took when he actually had the Covid 19 Virus. Caller states that he received paperwork after the vaccine from the (State), it has a bunch of blocks asking if he has this or that symptom.

The product they gave me at the (State) was the Pfizer-biontech vaccine. I had all the symptoms except vomiting/throwing up. I got all the other symptoms. no matter which way I turned it was hurting, knees, everything was hurting really bad. I was dizzy and weak so I don&#39;t want to walk around too much. I had muscle pain, joint pain, fever, headaches, chills, never went away. I hurt everywhere. I am really weak. My eyes are hurting. My daughter is in a girls home (paralysis problem). They had the vaccine from the another company and they have heard so many negative stuff so they decided they did not want to, when my wife told her I was having these problems. I had the virus 4 months, the nurse told me to take 300mg of zinc, 1000mg vitamin C and 2000mg vitamin D (the person took that when he had the disease). Should I take this stuff? Is there any information on that? what&#39;s in this? protein? my wife got the disease. They said she had enough antibodies. How long is the immunity? When does it start?&#34; The outcome of the event chills was resolved, of other events was unknown.

                                                Patient received 2nd dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine, was observed in office x 15&#43; minutes, and released home. Pt and his son exited the building and when they got to the car, the pt shouted out &#34;oh no!&#34; and collapsed to the ground. The patient was unconscious experiencing agonal respirations, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. There is an Emergency Room at the same location. Their staff came out and helped to transfer the pt to the ED for further evaluation. It was found that the patient had a known  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm (7/28/2017) that seemed to have ruptured. The patient was stabilized and transported to our local hospital and upon arrival, he was effectively comatose with a GCS 3. CT Head notated an extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage most probably related to a bleeding anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Neuro-Interventional Radiologist dictation reads &#34;Hunt Hess 5 Fisher grade 4 extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage and early hydrocephalus secondary to rupture of a known anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Initial ICP after EVD placement noted to be in the 120s now 68 treatment complicated by aneurysm rerupture after admission and increased volume of blood although large volume of hemorrhage was seen on initial scan and no change in the patient&#39;s clinical exam on her scale was noted due to this rerupture.  Patient&#39;s exam and prognosis are poor giving extensor posturing lack of extraocular movements to doll&#39;s maneuver and weak pupillary reflex as well as cough and gag.  Follows no commands or instructions at this time with no spontaneous movement on ventilator set at 12 overbreathing at 14-16 at this time without any sedation.&#34; The family opted to discontinue any further treatment to include surgical intervention given the findings. The patient was given comfort care with son and daughter at the bedside. The patient was extubated and expired at 1545h on 2/13/2021.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

By 3/1, I also had thigh and buttock ache with effort and left TMJ pain. On 3/2, I saw Dr. My sed rate was 24. She made a diagnosis of probable PMR and prescribed prednisone. After I single dose, my symptoms almost magically abated and I was almost normal. On 3/11, the only residual symptom with soreness with with extreme neck rotation. On clinical grounds, this confirms the diagnosis of PMR. I assume treatment will continue for several weeks.

An 80-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3242), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 06Feb2021 (at the age of 80 years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Ongoing relevant medical history included myopathy, neuropathy, neurological issues, and chronic pain. Additional medical history included the patient also had spinal cord surgery several years ago and sensation issues for a lot of years. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unknown date the patient experienced muscle ache, muscle spasms, injection site hurt bit, walking difficulty and walking painful.  On 10Feb2021 the patient experienced both legs are hurting. The patient reported that they had the first vaccine on the 06Feb2021 and the injection site hurt a little bit and a couple of days went by and then the patient had the muscle aches and all of a sudden it was severe with muscle cramps and spasms from the buttocks down the leg on the left side.  The patient stated that now both legs are hurting a lot from about 10Feb2021. The patient stated that he could barely walk and it was very painful to walk. The patient stated he was using a walker, cane, and holding onto objects when walking. The patient said it is a little better, but the patient still has to take baby steps and the patient is currently having a buttock spasms.  The patient stated they have the second appointment 27Feb2021 and the patient is leery of taking the second dose as the patient has not been able to function for the last 2.5 weeks and is not sure about getting the second dose. The clinical outcome of the muscle ache, injection site hurt, walking difficulty, walking painful and both legs are hurting was unknown. The outcome of the event muscle spasms/buttock spasms/ muscle cramps was not recovered.

The next day my husband complained about pain in his entire body and weakness, and I had the same.  In the evening he collapsed falling out of his wheelchair.  He tried for an hour to sit down back in his wheelchair with my help, but he couldn&#39;t.   He agreed that I call 911.  Two nurses took him to Emergency Room at Hospital and didn&#39;t allow me to go with him.  In the morning on Saturday, he was transferred to Room at Hospital and the next day to the Intensive Care Room, where he sadly passed away on Tuesday April 13 at 4:22 am.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 08:45 at single dose in right arm because of his age group /mass senior vaccination order. Medical history included blood pressure abnormal from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included blood pressure medicine since recent years. The patient previously had a flu shot (INFLUENZA VACCINE) but had that in early Nov2020. He kept saying it was the shot, but that he was fine. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient got vaccinated with the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 14Jan2021. He was feeling great with no problems. He sat and waited 15 minutes, and felt fine. When they were driving home after breakfast, her mother said she was talking asking him a question, and he wouldn&#39;t respond. Her father could hear her mother asking the question, but he said he could not think of what he wanted to say. He told her he couldn&#39;t think of what he was thinking on 14Jan2021. It probably started 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes after vaccination, and lasted 15-20 minutes. He kept trying to think of stuff. He kept repeating this for a little bit. His wife thought he was just trying to think of something, but couldn&#39;t remember. He was 81. He was very healthy and in shape. He still rides his bike every day. He walks in the morning to play golf too. When they got home and woke up from the nap, and he felt fine. He did say it was the weirdest thing, and that it had to have come from the shot. Since then, he has felt perfectly fine. He had nothing more going on that would indicate any side effect. Her concern was that it sounded like possibly a mini stroke. Upon checking with an HCP (Healthcare professional), the doctor was concerned that it might be a mini stroke and scheduled him for a CAT (Computerised axial tomography) scan. He kept saying it had to be the shot because he has been fine ever since. He had no issues with soreness at site or anything. He didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. He was driving when it happened. He didn&#39;t have a slur or anything. His second appointment is on the 04Feb2021. The event did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but required a visit to Physician Office in the morning of 18Jan2021. The outcome of the event couldn&#39;t think of what he wanted to say was recovered, and of the other event was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 81 years old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247 or EL3427), via an unspecified route of administration at Arm Left on 21Jan2021 09:33 at the 81 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   The medical history was none. The family medical history was none. The concomitant medications included warfarin from Mar2012 for Atrial fibrillation( AFib) and standard medications . The patient was not feeling well. All occurred on 21Jan2021 18:00, the patient developed symptoms, such as aches all over his body, aches all over with muscles pains with muscle pains, headache, joint pain, chills, injection site pain on left arm, body slightly warm, felt slightly warm, feeling unwell. He had chills all night and could not get warm. The reporter had not taken the patient&#39;s temperature yet. The patient takes regular medications. The patient was on warfarin and standard medications. The reporter stated the vaccine cards were mixed up because they did not write their names on them and the vaccine lot numbers looks like they were mixed up. Someone probably made a mistake because one says EL3247 and the other says EL3427, so she is not sure which it is. The handwriting is different on the cards. There was no Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was not Emergency Room Visit or physician&#39;s office required Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

A 81-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL9261, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 21Jan2021at 12:50 as a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included back pain and arthritis. Concomitant medications include propafenone taking for more 5 year still ongoing for indication atrial fibrillation and dutasteride taking for a year and half still ongoing for indication prostate. No history of all previous immunization with Pfizer vaccine and no prior vaccination in four weeks. On 21Jan2021, received first dose of the vaccine about 2 and a half weeks ago. He stated, it went fine but the day after, on 22jan2021 had some muscle tenderness (local light pain) and stiff neck and shoulder developed that was pretty mild but it was still going. It&#39;s about 2 and a half weeks now. In the morning it was maybe a tad more stiff mostly on left arm, it improved some when walking around and with exercising so he doesn&#39;t have to take medication. He stated, when you don&#39;t move it doesn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s when you move the neck muscle that it was sore but not much at all. At his age you have back pain and a little arthritis. It was strange that it started the day of or day after. He stated he did report just a bit of local pain but only when you touch the area and a very mild muscle pain, but it has continued and he doesn&#39;t know if it was related. He asked if this was related to the vaccine and how long this typically lasts. Mentioned he has had this pain before but he feels that he has avoided exercise or yoga or anything that would cause it now. he does have arthritis in his back. He was scheduled to receive the second dose of the vaccine on 11Feb2021. He didn&#39;t receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of the events was still unsure if he had this before vaccine or not and its persisting.The outcome of all events were not recovered.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right shoulder on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, stage 3 renal failure (was not bad, was in stage 5 couple of years ago, was a month or so away from full failure, was in the hospital and had dialysis, was able to get reversed with medication and diet), high blood pressure, and blood cholesterol increased/high cholesterol. The reporter stated that with regards to patient&#39;s height, he shrunk a little. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, didn&#39;t get flu shots. Concomitant medications include about 12 other unspecified drugs, takes statins, has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Patient started experiencing pain behind his left knee about 6 or 7 days later in Mar2021 (also reported as 04 or 05Apr2021, pending clarification). By that Sunday, it had gotten worse. The leg swelled and was also having foot swelling because blood flow wasn&#39;t there. There was no TIA&#39;s no stroke, no heart racing, no sweating, was all pain. Got leg up and kept elevated until they could get to the doctor and get imaging. Patient went Monday 08Mar2021 to see the doctor. Patient was brought to the doctor and was then sent to the imaging place. Radiology read the imaging around 5:15pm on the Monday, 08Mar2021. The radiologist said there was 2.5&#34; blood clot behind the left knee. He had never had a blood clot before. Patient was then sent to the Emergency Room at (Name) Hospital, in (Name) where they live. Was kept there several hours. Did a lot more blood tests. He was immediately put on 10mg ELIQUIS 10mg, once in the morning, and once at night. He is now taking 5mg Eliquis in the morning, and 5mg at night. He has not had any of these problems before the Pfizer shot. The reporter knew that not a lot had been reported. It seemed it should be safe. The correlation and timing having the shot on 23Feb2021 and all of a sudden a week and a half later this happened. It was 10 days later. There was nothing they can do about it. Just continuing with the ELIQUIS, trying to dissolve the blood clot, will be staying on it for 4 to 6 months. It was a pretty big blood clot and were worried about it breaking up and traveling. The patient had no other symptoms, had a sore arm, that was it. Patient going back to (Name) 01Jun2021 and he will have another CT scan or ultra sound when they get back. The reporter did not want to need to get the leg amputated. Patient was only in the ER, was not admitted to the hospital. Patient was concerned because of his age. If it doesn&#39;t dissolve, they know there will be a lot more trouble. The event of pain left knee, blood clot and sore arm required a visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 01Apr2021 (lot number: ER8730) in the right arm. The outcome of events was unknown.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) first dose on 30Dec2020 10:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that I had the vaccine back a week and half ago on 30Dec2020 and was due to get the booster this month and wanted to report severe pain arm for two days. The patient stated that he had many vaccine (Unspecified Vaccine) over the years and have never had anything that hurts so bad after about six hours. The patient just wanted to know that was that normal. Consumer further stated, &#34;I took the vaccine about 10:30 in the morning and about four hours later, it started getting sore but that thing was normal you know some vaccines (Unspecified Vaccine) do that but along with that it started hurting about four hours after the vaccine and it continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad. The patient even have thoughts about getting up and go in to the emergency room. It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm. I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side and all I did was take Tylenol as prescribed and that helped a little bit but not much but I did not go to the emergency room, I am not going to do that but I felt like it because it hurts so bad but I made it through the night and next day it continued to hurt really bad. I just keep taking Tylenol every four hours and that continued for two days and then finally I was able to raise my arm up above my head without little pain, it was discomfort, but it was not hurting so bad.&#34; The patient stated that the event started about two hours later it started, it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe, that is the reason why I am calling that it was severe. I wanted a shot or morphine to relieve myself that how bad it was.&#34; (no clarified further). The patient stated that the vaccine was given in my left arm only about one inch below the top of my shoulder which I think that might have been the problem, I don&#39;t know if you can answer that or not but I have never received the vaccine or shot anywhere near that area, it is always three or four inches down in my muscle, on my arm either on left or right, this was given in my left arm but this was given almost in my joint I am wondering if that would cause pain.&#34; The patient stated it was given only one inch below the tip above shoulder may be that is causing so much pain.&#34; The patient just wanted to report the severe pain, that was for two whole days and then it was subsided and it lasted for four days and I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm. I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 82-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient also started to receive mirtazapine (MIRTAZAPINE, 50 mg, Capsule, soft), via an unspecified route of administration, from an unspecified date at 50 mg, once a day for sleep. Medical history included sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], calcium, escitalopram, finasteride, lamotrigine, simvastatin, tamsulosin. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported receiving the Pfizer vaccine in his right arm on 06Feb2021. That evening he took his nightly medication and went to bed at 11:30 pm. He stated he wasn&#39;t able to sleep because he felt like he was in a refrigerator and he was shaking. He had lower back pain, right arm/shoulder pain, and went to the bathroom 5 times (all on an unspecified date in Feb2021), which was not normal for him. The patient added that it was the second dosage of the Pfizer (Covid-19 Vaccine) her received on 06Feb2021. And he had some negative response: a little pain in his shoulder but the worst thing that happened, he went to bed 11:30 did not sleep at all. At 11:30 night, he took his medication (Mirtazapine) and went to bed. He was shaking and he had to put another blanket on himself. Eventually, it was okay, but the problem is he was not able to sleep all night, from 11:30 to 9&#39; O clock this morning (07Feb2021). Consumer stated, &#34;Yesterday my wife and I had the second dose of the Pfizer and I had really strange reaction and I will tell you what it was. Last night at about 11:30 I took my night medicine (later clarified as Mirtazapine), I went to bedroom, I started shaking all over. And the worst part is from 11:30 to 10 o&#39; clock this morning, I was not able to sleep. There is slight pain in my shoulder&#34;. When confirmed if the consumer wanted to report the same or have any questions, consumer stated, &#34;No, we have no problem with temperature is fine, the oxygen is fine. Just I don&#39;t understand why in fact the medication (mirtazapine) is to induce sleeping, use to for sleep within half hour but it didn&#39;t help. I wanted to know what happened. So, this will eventually go away?&#34; The action taken in response to the events for mirtazapine was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on batch number has been requested.

Problem lasted for about a half hour. But a certain amount of weakness persisted and is still with me. Had one other wooziness episode on 1/24 at about the same time. This is new to me and may not be a reaction to the vaccination.

                                                bronchitis; Arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 83-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: A3246/H3246, via an unspecified route of administration from 12Jan2021 08:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and ongoing cough. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had a minor cough and was spitting up phlegm but had no temperature before he got the vaccine. The patient had bronchitis but no virus currently. He still has a bit of cough. He wanted to know if it gets worse was, he allowed to take an antibiotic and if taking antibiotics or prednisone will interfere with the vaccine as he already received the first dose. He was asking if it got worse, should he wait five more days and then go to the doctor. He wanted to know if prednisone affects the vaccine. The only side effect of COVID-19 Vaccine was his arm was hurting for about four to five hours on 12Jan2021, but that was it. The patient took two Tylenol. Arm soreness went away maybe five to seven hours later. The outcome of the event arm soreness was recovered while bronchitis was unknown.    Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction.

An 83-year-old male (also age at vaccination) patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right (reported as Right upper arm) on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported that &#34;I have had one stent and one angioplasty done. Stent was done last year in 2020 and angioplasty was done in &#39;1990&#39; (not confirmed).&#34; The patient also added &#34;I gained a bunch of weight when I had my thyroid removed.&#34; The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date for Covid-19 immunization.

Yesterday (02Mar2021), I ended up in the emergency room because I was having some problems with chest pain. So, I presume this is all connected to the second shot I got.&#34; It was added by the patient, &#34;I am asking question. About an hour or less than an hour ago I woke up, and my whole body felt like it was itching. I mean my whole body was just feeling funny. I was itching all over, that went away, I took a pill a while ago for that. &#39;Lorazepam&#39; (not confirmed over the call), it&#39;s a nerve, anxiety pill and it kind of helped. But right now, my feet are numb and cold.&#34; For the laboratory test the patient stated that, &#34;Yes they did a lab test on me yesterday (02Mar2021) as I went to the emergency room with some heart problems. They did blood work, that&#39;s all they did.&#34; The patient reported for the results, &#34;They said everything was fine.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient explained that &#34;No, I didn&#39;t take any medication for that.&#34; However treatment was received for Whole body felt like itching, whole body was just feeling funny.

An 84-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (he has had it for years. He says he uses a machine when he goes to bed, a mask).

He was squirting and had loose stool Wednesday morning and then that continued until today, he was not squirting, was having very loose stool, that was better, since he was not squirting. He still has some loose stools but was no longer &#34;squirting&#34; and still had a feeling in the bottom of his stomach like he needs to go to the bathroom. The headache gradually improved after the initial injection and he only has a little headache left currently. Patient had a headache the first couple of days, it was real light until now, he was still kind of not back to normal. He wanted to know if this will go away, since he is due for next virus shot in a week or so and was kind of dubious about taking it.

A 84-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. After vaccination, the patient park the car and all of a sudden he started to get like pins and needles they used to call in old days in his feet, in his toes. Last time he had this something like this years ago, he sat in the car too long. So, he loosen up his snickers and all and sat there, everything else was all right, a lady came over 15 minutes later and she said okay they can go. So the patient said he got some pins and needles in his feet, before he said the lady said &#34;huh, are you having trouble breathing or anything&#34;, the patient said no he felt fine. So let they go home, and then the patient went home it&#39;s at night when he was laying down he didn&#39;t get much reaction and all. So he went up to the doctor she looked at up a few things and opened few things and the patient didn&#39;t think the doctor really had an answer for it. It was scheduled to go Monday again for the second it was still there. The patient didn&#39;t know it was probably kind of nerve reaction and all and his wife said it could be psoriasis, he never had this, it was not aggravating it&#39;s only when he walked he forgot he even had it . It&#39;s just uncomfortable and the bottom of his feet. He never had any reaction to any shot whether it was shingles or pneumonia, flu shots or whatever. The outcome of events was unknown.

The following Friday, exactly a week later, on 22Jan2021 at 930am he got violently sick as far as throwing up and dysentery. He was asking if it could be from the shot. He got sick and was heaving for 7 hours, then he was dry heaving after throwing up so much, it was green bile. He knew he was getting dehydrated and drank a bottle of Pedialyte at 7pm that night. He had to stay a half hour after getting the vaccine since they wanted to monitor him a little longer since he takes blood thinners an other crap. He did not specify the other medications that he takes. On Saturday he felt fine but he felt weak. The patient recovered from dysentery and throwing up on 23Jan2021, while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

My grandfather then presented to the ED for further evaluation. Work-up included a CT scan of the head (negative for acute CVA or acute hemorrhage), UA (negative for infection) and BMP/CBC (unremarkable). Physician ruled out acute causes of symptoms, diagnosed patient with acute choreo vs dystonia, and advised follow-up with PCP.  My grandfather followed up with PCP the day after presenting to the ED day 3 after second covid-19 shot) and felt symptoms might be related to the second covid shot.

The intensity varies but is always there. My doctor could find no serious problem and suggested a possible B12 connection and ordered a blood test.

Now, I can sleep under oxygen and it doesn&#39;t bother me anymore and when I get up I don&#39;t need oxygen anymore and I can breathe freely.&#34; Wanted to know how long will his symptoms last. He was as weak as a rag, has a little fever that comes and goes, does not go over 101, stated he was taking Eliquis does not know if that was important or not, slept with oxygen but has not had any trouble breathing.

                                                Heart stopped; Could not swallow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s wife). An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

I am an avid bike rider and suddenly cannot stand on my feet due to extreme pain.

                                                85 year old male who presents with 2 episodes loose black stools, weakness, decreased appetite, increased lethargy and subjective fever today, 02/22.  Again admitted and had further rheumatological and infectious work up with negative results  He was initially admitted to Hospital on 02/12 with fatigue, atypical chest pain, melena. He had received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02/10. He was hospitalized from 02/12-02/15 and  thought to have viral pericarditis.  Diagnosis at discharge: SIRS DUE TO NONINFECTIOUS PROCESS W ACUTE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION.   He was started on celebrex in addition to the the colchicine as an anti-inflammatory.  After initiation of the anti inflammatory medications, patient&#39;s fever resolved, he started feeling better and his inflammatory markers decreased.  He was monitored for another days and was feeling better.  He is therefore being discharged home.  In view of the negative work up, there is suspicion that these may be a hyper inflammatory response to the COVID vaccine since his symptoms were temporally related.

I could not sleep much on March 8 evening. The pain persisted all day Tuesday March 9, 2021.  I called my ortho doctor and made a morning appointment for March 10, 2021 at 8:15am. I did not sleep much on evening of March 9. On Wednesday March 10 I went to the doctor. On this morning, the upper back muscles were OK, and the pain and spasms wer now in the neck. I could hardly move my head up or down and left and right. Dr. perscribed Methylprednazolone (4mg, 6-5-4-3-2-1 doses) and cyclobenzaprine 5mg (3x daily).  after 1 day and 1 dose, I feel I can movemy head a little farther without the stabbing pain.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

The patient was vaccinated, and appeared fine. Once he got to the waiting area, he stated, &#34;I feel hot.&#34; His coat was removed, the manager was notified,. We gave the patient something to drink, a snack, and a cold icepack. Once the patient&#39;s condition continued to decline, vital signs were assessed. Blood pressure was 140/110, pulse oximetry was 87% on room air, and patient was placed on oxygen. I notified the manager to go grab the doctor as I was helping the patient. The doctor brought a glucometer to make sure the patient was not hypoglycemic, and the result was 117 mg/dL. At this point the patient was diaphoretic, and complaining of pain in his abdomen. He also complained of nausea. The squad was alerted, and came to get the patient. At this point the patient&#39;s pulse ox was 53% on 6L of oxygen. Patient&#39;s family was present with the patient, and the patient was then transported to the hospital via EMS.

An 85-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 09Feb2021 (Lot Number: EM9810) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2, at the age of 85-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 20Jan2021 (lot number: EL3302) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and experienced Vertigo, felt peculiar, nausea, dizziness/swimmy headed. The patient previously received the flu shot for immunization and experienced Sore arm. He is 85 and not familiar with all the goings on today but heard a report the other day and did not know there was such a thing as Vertigo. He thought that was just a movie. When he took the shot at (place name) in (county name) on 20Jan2021, soon thereafter, not that day but maybe next, he felt peculiar. It was just uneasiness and he did not feel right. That went on and on 09Feb2021, he got second shot and he got swimmy headed, but it has continued on since then and probably gotten worse, especially when he gets up in the morning. He has to hold on until he gets balanced or coordinated. It just doesn&#39;t seem right After he gets up and gets going, it is not as prevalent. But then sometimes it strikes him and he is just completely out of it. He later stated the peculiar feeling and swimmy headedness started the same day as the first injection, but he just did not really pay attention to it and thought it was just one of those things that you accept with getting older. Wife and he both went and he thought his feelings were merely from excitement or depletion or exhaustion. He felt like he had weakness and he just felt different. He got it at noon and waited for 15 minutes. Because of the events around him at the time, it did not register with him because it was the stress of driving 30 miles through expressway. Old people aren&#39;t used to driving that far. It got worse after the second shot and then he really knew something was wrong. When you are old, you have these feelings and pains and aches and all that stuff, and you just accept it as being old. It did not register with him until a couple of weeks ago when he heard it on TV about Vertigo and he said that is what he has. The swimmy headedness was really more noticeable after second shot, it brought it on stronger. He does not complain about things and thought it may just be getting old. He said it just kept on and getting a little worse and worse. Then he said something is not right and one day he bent over to look up and almost blacked out because of sensation in equilibrium or vision or whatever. He got scared and that was a couple of weeks ago. (name) was not cognizant of what was going on until he heard on television about Vertigo. One of the news channel mentioned or somebody mentioned it. It was just general things. He confirmed it was regarding someone who had gotten Vertigo after getting the vaccine but did not have a particular person to report on. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required. The outcome of the event dizziness aggravated and Weakness was not recovered, other events was unknown.

                                                Vaccine was administered on 1/12/21 at Memory Care. On 1/15/21 at 12:30 he developed slurred speech at his facility and slumped to his left side. Out of concern for stroke he was sent by ambulance to Hospital. There he was found to have no evidence of stroke on MRI or CT angiogram. He was admitted to the hospital due to fever and  elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, CRP) and transaminases. He was found to have a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG. His symptoms resolved the following morning and may have represented a TIA. He had many markers consistent with COVID-19 and his CT pulmonary angiogram did show ground glass opacities but no pulmonary embolism. It was difficult to assess if this was a reinfection with COVID-19, persistent PCR positivity from November, or an adverse event to the vaccine.

                                                right hand swelling, right knee swelling, right ankle swelling, facial swelling of left cheek Narrative:  Following 1st COVID-19 vaccine dose on 12/17/20, patient seen at Emergency Department on 12/21/20- 12/22/20 for eval of new left cheek swelling and right hand/ankle swelling. Hand x-ray did not show signs of fracture, head CT did not show any signs of new strokes, and labs showed mild BNP elevation. Per ED note, &#34;Based on the patient history, physical, and initial vital signs - the patient&#39;s initial presentation is concerning for heart failure/volume overload-&gt;pulmonary edema and bilateral pedal edema.&#34; He received ipratropium neb x1 and returned to facility. Neurology consulted (12/22/20), &#34;It is difficult to determine whether the patient has a new facial palsy or whether this is recrudescence of his previous stroke deficits. Given the swelling of his left face it is quite possible that there is inflammation causing some partial left facial nerve dysfunction that would not include the forehead. The pattern of weakness is, however, also consistent with what would be expected from his documented right MCA stroke. At this point it is appropriate to consider this a possible complication of his vaccination (Bell&#39;s palsy has been reported in some after Covid19 vaccination). However, I would not recommend any specific treatment for the facial weakness as the etiology is still somewhat unclear.&#34; Patient admitted to hospital 1/2/21-1/8/21 for mild hypothermia with possible AMS and found to have adenovirus. Head CT negative for CVA. Sepsis/toxic/metabolic w/u was unrevealing. Given IVF for diarrhea; C diff negative. Discharged to facility. Patient received 2nd COVID-19 pfizer vaccine on 1/13/21 in Right Deltoid w/o complications (lot#: EK9231, exp. 04/30/2021)

He was using a cane instead. He used a cane to walk with before this, but not for this reason. He never had any real serious aching. He had a little soreness in his arm on an unspecified date in Jan2021, but nothing out of the ordinary. He didn&#39;t know his arm was sore until he rubbed it. He though it might have been on Sunday when he noticed it. He was not sure. Prior to this, he had redness on the toe of his left foot on an unspecified date in Jan2021. He was prescribed an antibiotic that he was still taking. He was unable to provide the name of the antibiotic.

                                                I thought I was having a heart attack; I had severe left arm pain; I didn&#39;t get much sleep that night; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 86-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 08Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib) and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient was taking loads of medications. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and reported that he had no problems with the first dose. The patient experienced severe left arm pain at the arm where the shot was given on 08Mar2021, the night after he received his second COVID vaccine dose. He almost called a number because he thought he was having a heart attack. What he did was he got up to walk around and the pain went away and when he sat down on his recliner, the pain came back so he didn&#39;t get much sleep that night. He was fine the next day. The patient took an ASPIRIN 325 mg coated pill because he thought he might be having a heart attack. If he had known, he would have taken the vaccine on his right arm. His arm hurt the night of 08Mar2021 until 6:00 AM the following day. The patient then stated that his recommendation was to tell the people who are administering the shot that a left arm pain may possibly occur because anybody who has the left arm hurting is afraid and can think they have a heart attack. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 09Mar2021 at 06:00 AM, and recovered on 09Mar2021 for all other events.

An 87-years-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL3249, intramuscular on left arm on 13Jan2021 (Time the vaccination was given: 13:00-13:15) at the age of  87-years-old at single dose for prevention because of age group.  Medical history included covid-19 in Jun2020, forgetful from an unknown date, he got a little forgetful sometimes, so he may have forgotten to tell her.  This occurred prior to getting the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Family medical history was none. The patient got the Pfizer COVID vaccine last week on 13Jan2021, he was really sick in Jan2021. The patient had weak legs anyway, but he got so weak.  Weakness in legs started at night on 13Jan2021, around 20:00. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office required. He never complained of any symptoms and did not know if there were other symptoms, because he did not complain.  He fell on Thursday night on 14Jan2021. He got the vaccine around 1:00-1:15pm, and got so weak, that he went to the bathroom and he fell in the floor.  His legs just continued to get worse.  It started on Wednesday night on 13Jan2021.  He could not walk in Jan2021.  Thursday was the worst. By Friday, it started to get better.  He did not get hospitalized.  He could not get up without help. The patient had Covid 19 in Jun2020. He had a lot of symptoms after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The reporter reported her father fell in the bathroom while brushing his teeth and her brother had to come over to get him up. The reporter was starting to wonder if he should take the second dose. The outcome of the events Weakness in legs and fell was resolving and of the other events was unknown. The reporter considered event Weakness in legs was serious due to medically significant and disabling; considered event fall was serious due to medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of the events muscular weakness, fall and gait disturbance cannot be excluded. The events are confounded by the elderly patient&#39;s underlying conditions.

An 88-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, diabetic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he had started no new medications and not had any other recent vaccinations. He took a lot of medications for a lot of things. He was diabetic, had high blood pressure, COPD, a variety of things get over the years, he took medication for these things. He was affected by medications more than most people. No further details provided about his medications. He reacted to medications in general and that because of that he usually took lower dosages. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After 2 weeks from the vaccine. Have weakness and stomach pains and diarrhea. The patient had been artificially sick like 4-5 days since 21Jan2021, and had a test done and it didn&#39;t show up. He said he hadn&#39;t been anywhere to get the virus. He said he didn&#39;t have any fever, his oxygen level hadn&#39;t changed, he had a testing kit with thermometers, so he knew he never had a fever, but he got chills. He got all the symptoms, the stomach problems, diarrhea, back problems, overall weakness and low energy. He was fine two weeks before this, this started almost two weeks to the day and minute from when he went and got the shot. When he got the shot he had nothing, he waited 15-20 minutes with no problems, his arm was hurting for a couple days, but there was nothing else. Two weeks later he got basically an artificial case and the corona virus test said no, clarified to being negative, but he said it didn&#39;t go away, it had been from Thursday to Monday, so 5 days. The big problem was he was supposed to get his second shot Friday, and he had an appointment Wednesday, he would like to ask them too, but he would like to know was it dangerous for him to get the second shot. He didn&#39;t think he can get any sicker. He did not do a report online, he tried to get onto the website but nothing told him how to do it or whatever, so he stayed on the line waiting to talk to someone. Height: he was five feet and nine and three quarters inches tall, he had shrunk with age, everyone got smaller. His arm was not sore for very much, he didn&#39;t remember how long, he got sick two weeks later, and now he was really not well, though he was better than he was on Thursday or Friday, though he was not 100% yet. He would like to know if he should get the second shot, because he was too old to die from a corona virus shot. Investigations: He didn&#39;t know which COVID test they used, they did an instant test with results in an hour. The patient inquiry if he should get the second shot since he had had this artificial sickness for 5-7 days, two weeks after getting the vaccine. He had &#34;sore arm for a couple of days&#34; after the 1st injection, but &#34;nothing more&#34;. However, in the last 4-5 days, he&#39;s been feeling &#34;miserable&#34;. He didn&#39;t have fever. But he&#39;s been experiencing aching, diarrhea, upset stomach, lost weights and nasal drip. He tested negative to the COVID virus. He has a doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled this Wednesday. The outcome of events was unknown.

Medical history included Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago, Quadruple Bypass surgery in 2003, High blood pressure. He was Diabetic, was a heart patient. Before he had his ostomy, he had colitis that causes the patient to bleed when pooping and his guts were ravaged. His stomach might be weakened from having it for years and years in his 30&#39;s, 40&#39;s to early 50&#39;s.  Family medical history included Grandfather died at 42 of bleeding ulcer in his stomach. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. He has allergies to pills but was not taking any.  He does not have a fever.

On 02Feb2021, that is when his ostomy shot out blood like a faucet when he was taking a shower.  He was changing the bandage that day, he was changing his right sided ileostomy bag and he told her that blood shot out of it &#34;like a faucet.&#34; On 3Feb2021 was nerve wracking, but there was no blood.  He was changing his ostomy pad again on 04Feb2021 and it started bleeding so much that he went to the hospital. He was discharged within a few hours because &#34;they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.&#34; He has had colitis for years and has an ileostomy, where they take out a bunch of his colon.  This week he has had some funny bleeding in his ileostomy.  It was spurting out blood.  He had to go to the ER on 4Feb2021 night because it was bleeding and then it stops. People in ER did not know what the bleeding was from.  He was bleeding in the ileostomy on 04Feb2021 and 05Feb2021.  On 05Feb2021 his ostomy bled a little bit more but it has not bled again since 06Feb2021. She also reports that he feels, &#34; icky, tired, no appetite and achy.&#34; The feeling unwell began on 7Feb2021. That worsened since loss of blood made him weaker and worried.  When he got back from the hospital/ER, he said they were rude.  There was a blizzard.  He checked in around 8pm and they discharged him around 11pm that same night.  ER visit at the institution on 04Feb2021, 8pm to 11pm and released. They performed CT scan abdomen and Pelvis and IV. Results are unknown. Now he was good. The achiness and tiredness was between persistent and worsened. He was worrying now. She took his forehead temperature and it was good on 7Feb2021.  She took everybody&#39;s and they were all good.  He just feels icky and the blood thing is nerve wracking. He is convinced it is coming back. He was not on a blood thinner or anything listed on the vaccine fact sheet. The patient experienced Feeling unwell on 6Feb2021 with outcome of Not Recovered (Feeling unwell was reported as worsened), achy and tired on 5Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, No appetite on 7Feb202108:30  with outcome of Not Recovered, Bleeding out of ileostomy on 2Feb2021 09:45 with outcome of Recovering, Did not sleep on 7Feb2021 21:30  with outcome of Not Recovered. He has a lot of the risk factors; He is Diabetic, is a heart patient, and has high blood pressure, but he really wanted to get the shot. The patient&#39;s primary care provider&#39;s nurse do not believe the bleeding had anything to do with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                My father was given his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 13, 2021.  He went downhill the following week.  He fell 9 times and was very confused.  He was taken to the hospital on Feb. 20 and admitted that day.  He spent a week there.  His condition continued to deteriorate.  He was totally bedridden for a week.  His mental status deteriorated.  By Feb. 22, he was unable to talk, he drooled, and had to be fed.  He made  slow improvement later in the week.  We were never given any reason for his condition.  There was no infection, no stroke, etc.  He was discharged and sent to rehab on Feb. 27.  He remained there until April 8.   He is currently doing fairly well.  He uses a walker and gait belt in the house and is receiving home therapy.  He is not as independent as he was before.  His short term memory seems to be more impaired than it was previously.

                                                having a sore arm; headaches; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Consumer (patient). This 89-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246, expiration date: 30Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 12:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hearing issue from 10 years ago and wearing hearing aids, surgery for dislocated vertebrae in neck two years ago, currently having 6 screws in his neck, ongoing Spinal stenosis, ongoing allergic to penicillin and sulfa. Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL) from an unspecified date and ongoing for pain from spinal stenosis. The patient went on a 0.5 mile walk everyday in his neighborhood. He got his pain in his back and shoulders after he finished the walk so he took Tylenol. He didn&#39;t take it on a regular basis though. He just took a couple of tablets. The patient got his first injection of the COVID 19 vaccine at 12:15 on 12Jan2021. After he got home , he went online to find out more information on the vaccine. He was originally concerned about having a sore arm, headaches, and all this on Jan2021. He asked about the medication online. It said you can take Tylenol after the vaccine, but do not take it before the vaccine, and that was exactly what he did. He took 2 Tylenol an hour before the vaccine. The doctor was concerned about his age because of his immune system being borderline. That was why he got the vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.

An 89-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3249, expiry date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration (injection) in the left arm on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 89-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was on unspecified concomitant medications. The patient stated he has been taking the same medications for several years, and he has had no problems with those. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day. The patient had his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 22Jan2021. He was due for his second shot on 12Feb2021. After he had the first shot, his body got itchy all over and it was still itchy. He also had little tiny pimples on his skin, and it was very uncomfortable. He was wondering if this was a known reaction to the product. He had no idea what to do to relieve the itching. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021, and the itching started either the next day or two days after getting the vaccine. His body became very itchy, and he was itchy all over. He was developing little red like pimples all different parts of his body; itchy bumps. The itching and pimples having continued through to now, and it seemed to get even more itchy in the evening at bedtime. Last night (unspecified date), he had it on the top of his feet down there, on the top and in between his toes. Those itchy bumps were all over, and he did not know if that was the Pfizer shot.  The patient tried different anti-itch creams on it, and that relieved it for a while, but then it came back. He used clobetasol propionate, but it had not worked. They stopped itch for a while but then it does not help. He tried some just plain anti-itch cream (clarified as Gold Bond Anti-Itch Cream) to stop the itching. It stopped itch for a while, but then it did not help. He did not have to use the cream until 3-4 days. It was some prescription from the doctor, but it was for his wife. He tried it, but it did not do anything. The patient stated the injection itself did not give him any problems. The patient was wondering whether he should take the second shot if this one gave him so much trouble. The clinical outcome of discomfort was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.

An 89-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 12:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included vascular dementia; hypertension; hypothyroidism; malignant melanoma of back (resected/in remission); bladder cancer (surgery in Nov2018/in remission); prediabetic; chronic kidney disease stage 3 due to hypertension; and sleep related hypoxia. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included donepezil taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; memantine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; levothyroxine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lisinopril taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lovastatin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; fluoxetine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and unspecified multivitamin tablet. The patient previously received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19) on 26Feb2021 07:45 PM in the left arm for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has not received other vaccine in four weeks. The first day after the shot, there were not any adverse reactions. The next morning at approximately 11:00 am, the reporter found patient laying on the floor next to his bed, eyes glazed over, disoriented, and he said &#34;he felt funny&#34;. The reporter got him sitting up leaning on the side of the bed and called. The EMT&#39;s came and checked his vitals. Within half an hour from  finding the patient laying on the floor, he seemed almost back to normal. However, since he is 89 years old, the patient was transported by ambulance. Blood was drawn, a urine sample was taken, a chest Xray, and a CT scan of his head and his spine were the labs that were run. All the labs came back normal. However, once patient got home after being in the ER for 5 hours, he is very weak, can barely stand and barely walk without human assistance and his walker. The way he is acting is more like he had a stroke. Onset of the events reported as 20Mar2021 11:15 AM. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient used walker due to can barely stand and barely walk; for other events, there was no treatment given.
