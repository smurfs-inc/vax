He stated he got his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on 04Jan2021 and woke up 9 days later on 13Jan2021 with Bell&#39;s Palsy, which was medically significant. He said he was not sure if he should get his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot that was scheduled for Monday, 25Jan2021. He asked if Bell&#39;s Palsy has been a reported side effect of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he refuses to take steroids for the Bell&#39;s Palsy. He said he had an incident in 2019 where he was prescribed steroids for an arthritic condition, and he ended up septic. No treatments were received. Outcome of the event was resolving. Drug result by physician was related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported Bell&#39;s Palsy cannot be excluded.

                                                On Saturday 2/6/21 in the morning on the left side under  armpit felt like he had a pulled muscle or something. It eventually radiated over up into the left quadrant of his chest where he could not push down on it.  It was extremely painful by Monday.  He has a history of esophageal spasms and exacerbated them to where he thought he was having a heart attack.  He called his Cardiologist and told him to go to the ER.  He went to the hospital Monday evening, he had two EKG&#39;s, had blood drawn 3 times, did sonograms looking for blood clots.  He did inform them that he had the vaccine on Friday and they told him it was due to that.  He went to nuclear medicine to get his lung checked for blood clots as well.  All tests were negative.  He saw his PCP today who told him that the lymph nodes were affected due to the vaccine.  He has improved greatly, still has some slight discomfort which his PCP said would go away in time.

This was in my lower abdomen below belly button on the left side. Really quiet frightening, in that this was not in any material regarding side affects. I considered the emergency room  Saturday night but didn&#39;t t go. Began to subside Sunday afternoon, leaving me sore to the touch. Only a little tenderness remains in the area. I have seen no physicians. I cannot speak to any permanent damage.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

His symptoms for COVID were severe achy cramps, hypotension, and dehydration. On 20Dec2020, COVID-19 test was positive. On 21Dec2020, the patient was given monoclonal antibodies.  A computerized tomogram (CT) of the lungs was performed on 21Dec2020 and it was ok. A week later (Dec2020), he had a repeat CT which showed increased infiltrates of 10 to 15%. He then started on dexamethasone, apixaban (ELIQUIS) and the rest of the things. He had a repeat CT on 05Jan2021 which showed resolution of the infiltrates; most of the lesions went gone. CT results had improved significantly. The patient underwent a second COVID test a week ago which was still positive. He had a third COVID on 06Jan2021, but results were not available yet. The patient queried if he can proceed with second dose planned on 07Jan2021 or if he should wait.

                                                perfuse sweating; mild tenderness of arm; Muscle pain; Chills; Weakness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).   A 78-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) intramuscular at single dose at left deltoid on 11Jan2021 around 13:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history was none, he was basically healthy. There were no concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks), but the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose exactly 3 weeks before 1st dose on 21Dec2020 for covid-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. The patient began to have muscle pain, chills, and weakness about 8 hours or so after the 2nd vaccine on 11Jan2021. He states these symptoms have maybe gotten a little better, but have been continuing on for 2-3 days now. He is also experiencing perfuse sweating during 13Jan2021night. Right now, he was not experiencing this. Maybe a little bit, but not much. The caller experienced mild tenderness of arm on 12Jan2021: he explained when you press his arm, it hurts a little bit. No events required a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of muscle pain was and perfuse sweating was unknown, of chills, weakness was recovering, of mild tenderness of arm was not recovered. The patient was his own primary doctor. The reporter considered all events as medically significant and he believed these symptoms are related to receiving the vaccine because he stated he was okay before that.   No further information expected. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event muscle pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 78-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 (around 11:00 or 11:30 AM) on left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered at a military facility. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. He did not receive other vaccines 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient had his 1st dose on 12Jan2021. He was fine that day, but on the 13Jan2021, he woke up and was dizzy. He stated that he had no problem after having the shot, 15 minutes later, he had no problems; but, the next day he began having vertigo and dizziness. Vertigo and dizziness began 13Jan2021 at about 8:00 AM. This has continued the past 3 days. It is getting better, but he is wondering if that is a big problem. At the time of report, it&#39;s getting better but still have it. He asked if he should be concerned. It is quite a bit improved but it&#39;s still there. If he had to drive a car for an emergency, he thinks he could do it, but he wouldn&#39;t volunteer for that right now. He looked up all that stuff and it says that 20% of the people who take it have that. But when they list the side effects, they don&#39;t list dizziness until they list severe that is the only thing that has concerned him. He was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 09Feb2021, longer than the 3weeks. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Lightheadedness; Headache; tightness in his chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EK4176, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm/ shoulder area on 15Jan2021 at 11:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, patient has epilepsy that has been controlled since 1977; and issues with his blood pressure. He has no allergies. Concomitant medications included phenobarbital and phenytoin (DILANTIN), both for epilepsy. He takes HTZ TRI something, it is a long word but is basically 2 diuretic. He is also being followed by a cardiologist. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient got the COVID injection 2.5 hours ago on 15Jan2021 and after that he had a slight case of lightheadedness. He was instructed to drink water and walk if he was able, he did that and it helped. The patient relays that he was fasting that morning and thinks that had some degree of relatedness in the lightheaded feeling. He ate lunch and the light headedness resolved but now he has a slight headache. He was reading the paperwork and on the form under severe reactions, it mentions dizziness, weakness, and difficulty breathing. While he is breath ok, he has noticed a slight degree of tightness in his chest. He did not see this listed but wants to know if this is normal or if it would be related to the difficulty breathing. His main concern is if this is a severe reaction. He had lab work done prior to getting the vaccine, then none afterward. The events did not require visit to emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the event &#39;lightheadedness&#39; was recovered while unknown for the other events.

                                                Patient received his first dose of vaccine on 2/10 at 11:30am. (His 2nd is scheduled for 3/3) He started with sx ~13 hrs later - He started drifting out of consciousness, then had labored breathing through night rendering him unable to sleep. After getting up in the morning, his breathing was better but he felt lightheaded/weak through the day. By the next morning (Friday 2/12), he was so bad next morning that wife called 911 - He reports that he was there and then not there and was losing track of train of thought. He was taken to ER via EMS, where his HR was initially 15 - He was admitted to hospital - initially a temporary pacer was placed, then a permanent one on Monday, 2/22. He has had other episodes like this in past 13 mos. PCP referred him to neurologist and EENT. Neurology work-up, including MRI and 72 hr EEG were unremarkable, although he learned retrospectively that there was a time during EEG where HR was only 35. EENT found no auditory or other issues . *MD in ER told him that if issues were not neuro in nature, they were probably cardiac.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EM9809/expiration date: not provided), via intramuscular route of administration, on 04-FEB-2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 78 years old) 0.3mL as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included patient was diabetic since an unknown date and has psoriatic arthritis. Concomitant medication included infliximab (REMICADE) infusion every 8 weeks for psoriatic arthritis and cetirizine hydrochloride (EQUATE ALLERGY RELIEF). The patient had infliximab infusion the morning of 04Feb2021, prior to receiving the vaccination and was told that infliximab would not be a problem with receiving the vaccination on the same day. On 07Feb2021, the patient went to the emergency room due to Bell&#39;s palsy, which was described as swelling of lips, nose, mouth, and side of face and stated that he can&#39;t talk very good because his lips are swelled up/hard to talk and his eyes have been bothering him and he is blinking. The patient stated, &#34;I went to the emergency room at a hospital and what they said is totally unrelated to the COVID shot I got. In the meantime, few days after I had the shot, I had somehow got Bell&#39;s palsy caused the side of my face to swell up and droop on one side. I just wanted to get back to you so you knew that was not some reaction to the COVID shot, it was something else.&#34; Treatment for the event Bell&#39;s palsy included took Allergy Relief Equate 25mg ultra tablet and another allergy pill and it did not help swelling of lips, nose, mouth, and side of face. Relevant tests included blood work on an unspecified date in 2021 &#34;two weeks ago&#34; that was all good. The outcome of the events Bell&#39;s palsy, eyes have been bothering him and he is blinking and hard to talk was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown.

The patient stated feeling pretty good and pretty much back to normal on 01Feb2021, it did not affect breathing or cough, just fever and feeling lousy. The patient commented that he can relate to COVID because he had had the COVID and for 2 weeks he was like that. He also had the breathing problem with the virus in Aug2020, and he think he had every symptom but did not lose taste or smell. The patient asked if he should take his second dose of vaccine. The outcome of event chills was resolved on 29Jan2021. The outcome of event fever was resolved on 30Jan2021. The outcome of other events was resolving.

A 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 19Jan2021, at single dose, to prevent COVID, at a hospital. Medical history included lung cancer (19-year lung cancer survivor), mild heart attack in 2011, aortic valve replacement in 2013 and a heart issue. Concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included influenza vaccine received on 06Nov2020 for immunization. The patient reported that on he had the first vaccine shot on 19Jan2021 (10 days ago) and on 20Jan2021, when he raised his left arm where the vaccine was given, he felt a twinge of pain where that was, and a kind of numbness, it was nothing that restricts him in any way, but when he exercised in the morning and lifted his arm over his head he felt the twinge of pain, which was something he never experienced with the flu vaccine or any other vaccines. He wondered if it had something to do with this vaccine. He has not treated it, it has not bothered him much. He stated he feels it when he exercises it and swings his left arm, then he feels a bit tightness or a twinge of pain. He says it does not restrict him or cause him to cry out or anything. The patient also reported that he is scheduled for the second dose on 09Feb2021 and stated that he needs to get a dental procedure done on 04Feb2021 and needs to take amoxicillin for it due to past heart issue. The patient wanted to know if it is okay to take amoxicillin and was wondering if this medication will interfere with the second dose. He also asked if he should cancel the dental procedure. The patient mentioned that he had his annual wellness visit on an unspecified date and they did a lipid profile (unknown results) but it was not relevant in his opinion. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL1283) , via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 01:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included open heart surgery 11 years ago, covid-19 from Jul2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received bnt162b2 yesterday, with no problems. However today (18Jan2021), in 15 minutes after waking up at 11, he had the chills really bad, that went away, then he went to sleep again and woke up and he had all the symptoms on the paperwork, he had dizziness, headache, he&#39;s hardly ever had a headache ever. He had aches and pain. Caller states that he was just asking right now about another company, and their vaccine in started with an M, and her daughter is at a girls home, because she has a epileptic type thing, and this particular shot, that started with M, the nurse called over, and the problems that he is having he explained to the nurse is like when he had the virus previously about in Jul2020, when he had the virus he was in hospital for a week, because he had to get rid of the virus, and they got him out of that. Now he took this shot yesterday and the next day is when he got all these symptoms, he&#39;s tired, cant walk, muscle pain, had chills not any more, pain in the knees, everywhere really, he couldn&#39;t get any position to go back to sleep, his back knees elbow joint pain. Since he had these things, the nurse at the girls home, told his wife if having these problems he can take 300 mg of Zinc, 1000mg of Vitamin C, and 2000IU or Vitamin D, the same thing, that amount, he asks will it over come the symptoms. Another person felt good after getting those, it helped him he does state however that is what the person took when he actually had the Covid 19 Virus. Caller states that he received paperwork after the vaccine from the (State), it has a bunch of blocks asking if he has this or that symptom. His First dose was 17Jan2021 at 1:15, then on 07Feb2021 if this Second Dose. All the side effects started Today 18Jan2021. His doctor said he&#39;s in good health. He did have open heart surgery 11 years ago. The patient reported he is 5 feet 8 and a half inches, he is shrinking. He stated, &#34;I was good until this morning, it hit me like I had the virus. The product they gave me at the (State) was the Pfizer-biontech vaccine. I had all the symptoms except vomiting/throwing up. I got all the other symptoms. no matter which way I turned it was hurting, knees, everything was hurting really bad. I was dizzy and weak so I don&#39;t want to walk around too much. I had muscle pain, joint pain, fever, headaches, chills, never went away. I hurt everywhere. I am really weak. My eyes are hurting. My daughter is in a girls home (paralysis problem). They had the vaccine from the another company and they have heard so many negative stuff so they decided they did not want to, when my wife told her I was having these problems. I had the virus 4 months, the nurse told me to take 300mg of zinc, 1000mg vitamin C and 2000mg vitamin D (the person took that when he had the disease). Should I take this stuff? Is there any information on that? what&#39;s in this? protein? my wife got the disease. They said she had enough antibodies. How long is the immunity? When does it start?&#34; The outcome of the event chills was resolved, of other events was unknown.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

An 81-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246, expiry: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included retired, he became allergic to penicillin when he was 17 year old and hasn&#39;t taken it since, lost his taste and smell, potassium is high sometimes - the doctor recommend he cut down on banana and potatoes, extra heart beat, stomach acid, and thyroid disorder. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium - has been taking it for a year and a half to two years for thyroid, metoprolol succinate - has been on it about a year and half because an EKG showed he had an extra heart beat, and omeprazole capsule - been on it two or three years for stomach acid. The patient previously took trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy. After having a Pfizer shot on Saturday, he had a reaction - dizziness. His wife also received the COVID vaccine but did not have any reaction. He sat in the office for 15 minutes like he was supposed to. He drove home and was fine. Two hours later he was so dizzy he couldn&#39;t stand up. He was holding onto things to walk through the house. That was two hours after he took the vaccine. After that he thought it would go away in a day. All day yesterday, which was the second day, he was still dizzy. If he laid down the bed would float. It was an awful experience. He received the vaccine at 11:45am on 09Jan2021. Two hours later is when it started. He had to hold onto the rail to get up there. If he gets up quick it is still there. He just had blood work and was due back in Apr for check up. He hasn&#39;t had taste and smell for four years or better. He lost his taste and smell and never got it back. He doesn&#39;t know what caused that. He hasn&#39;t been sick. Outcome of the event dizziness was recovering, for the other events was unknown.

Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 08:45 at single dose in right arm because of his age group /mass senior vaccination order. Medical history included blood pressure abnormal from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included blood pressure medicine since recent years. The patient previously had a flu shot (INFLUENZA VACCINE) but had that in early Nov2020. He kept saying it was the shot, but that he was fine. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient got vaccinated with the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 14Jan2021. He was feeling great with no problems. He sat and waited 15 minutes, and felt fine. When they were driving home after breakfast, her mother said she was talking asking him a question, and he wouldn&#39;t respond. Her father could hear her mother asking the question, but he said he could not think of what he wanted to say. He told her he couldn&#39;t think of what he was thinking on 14Jan2021. It probably started 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes after vaccination, and lasted 15-20 minutes. He kept trying to think of stuff. He kept repeating this for a little bit. His wife thought he was just trying to think of something, but couldn&#39;t remember. He was 81. He was very healthy and in shape. He still rides his bike every day. He walks in the morning to play golf too. When they got home and woke up from the nap, and he felt fine. He did say it was the weirdest thing, and that it had to have come from the shot. Since then, he has felt perfectly fine. He had nothing more going on that would indicate any side effect. Her concern was that it sounded like possibly a mini stroke. Upon checking with an HCP (Healthcare professional), the doctor was concerned that it might be a mini stroke and scheduled him for a CAT (Computerised axial tomography) scan. He kept saying it had to be the shot because he has been fine ever since. He had no issues with soreness at site or anything. He didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. He was driving when it happened. He didn&#39;t have a slur or anything. His second appointment is on the 04Feb2021. The event did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but required a visit to Physician Office in the morning of 18Jan2021. The outcome of the event couldn&#39;t think of what he wanted to say was recovered, and of the other event was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number and expiry date were not provided) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The reporter stated that her husband (patient) received the first dose of the vaccine about two and one-half to three weeks ago and he had some aches and pain but it was not that bad. She was unsure of the exact day or time and does not know which arm. She reported that a day or two after the first dose he was achy and didn&#39;t feel like himself. He didn&#39;t say much about it. Then yesterday 26Jan2021 he got a major headache after the second dose; he would sleep and wake up and sleep again trying to get rid of the headache. She gave him Tylenol 650mg one by mouth and it didn&#39;t help. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about batch/Lot number has been requested.

Consumer further stated, &#34;I took the vaccine about 10:30 in the morning and about four hours later, it started getting sore but that thing was normal you know some vaccines (Unspecified Vaccine) do that but along with that it started hurting about four hours after the vaccine and it continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad. The patient even have thoughts about getting up and go in to the emergency room. It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm. I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side and all I did was take Tylenol as prescribed and that helped a little bit but not much but I did not go to the emergency room, I am not going to do that but I felt like it because it hurts so bad but I made it through the night and next day it continued to hurt really bad. I just keep taking Tylenol every four hours and that continued for two days and then finally I was able to raise my arm up above my head without little pain, it was discomfort, but it was not hurting so bad.&#34; The patient stated that the event started about two hours later it started, it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe, that is the reason why I am calling that it was severe. I wanted a shot or morphine to relieve myself that how bad it was.&#34; (no clarified further). The patient stated that the vaccine was given in my left arm only about one inch below the top of my shoulder which I think that might have been the problem, I don&#39;t know if you can answer that or not but I have never received the vaccine or shot anywhere near that area, it is always three or four inches down in my muscle, on my arm either on left or right, this was given in my left arm but this was given almost in my joint I am wondering if that would cause pain.&#34; The patient stated it was given only one inch below the tip above shoulder may be that is causing so much pain.&#34; The patient just wanted to report the severe pain, that was for two whole days and then it was subsided and it lasted for four days and I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm. I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                bronchitis; Arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 83-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: A3246/H3246, via an unspecified route of administration from 12Jan2021 08:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and ongoing cough. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had a minor cough and was spitting up phlegm but had no temperature before he got the vaccine. The patient had bronchitis but no virus currently. He still has a bit of cough. He wanted to know if it gets worse was, he allowed to take an antibiotic and if taking antibiotics or prednisone will interfere with the vaccine as he already received the first dose. He was asking if it got worse, should he wait five more days and then go to the doctor. He wanted to know if prednisone affects the vaccine. The only side effect of COVID-19 Vaccine was his arm was hurting for about four to five hours on 12Jan2021, but that was it. The patient took two Tylenol. Arm soreness went away maybe five to seven hours later. The outcome of the event arm soreness was recovered while bronchitis was unknown.    Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI.

An 83-year-old male (also age at vaccination) patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right (reported as Right upper arm) on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported that &#34;I have had one stent and one angioplasty done. Stent was done last year in 2020 and angioplasty was done in &#39;1990&#39; (not confirmed).&#34; The patient also added &#34;I gained a bunch of weight when I had my thyroid removed.&#34; The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date for Covid-19 immunization. For the concomitant medication the patient stated, &#34;Yes, I am taking medications.&#34; (specified medications not reported/ provided). It was reported by the patient that, &#34;I got this, my second COVID-19 Vaccine shot Saturday morning. All day Saturday (27Feb2021), all day Sunday and most of Monday, I was so sick, I didn&#39;t realize what was going on. Yesterday (02Mar2021), I ended up in the emergency room because I was having some problems with chest pain. So, I presume this is all connected to the second shot I got.&#34; It was added by the patient, &#34;I am asking question. About an hour or less than an hour ago I woke up, and my whole body felt like it was itching. I mean my whole body was just feeling funny. I was itching all over, that went away, I took a pill a while ago for that. &#39;Lorazepam&#39; (not confirmed over the call), it&#39;s a nerve, anxiety pill and it kind of helped. But right now, my feet are numb and cold.&#34; For the laboratory test the patient stated that, &#34;Yes they did a lab test on me yesterday (02Mar2021) as I went to the emergency room with some heart problems. They did blood work, that&#39;s all they did.&#34; The patient reported for the results, &#34;They said everything was fine.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient explained that &#34;No, I didn&#39;t take any medication for that.&#34; However treatment was received for Whole body felt like itching, whole body was just feeling funny.

The following Friday, exactly a week later, on 22Jan2021 at 930am he got violently sick as far as throwing up and dysentery. He was asking if it could be from the shot. He got sick and was heaving for 7 hours, then he was dry heaving after throwing up so much, it was green bile. He knew he was getting dehydrated and drank a bottle of Pedialyte at 7pm that night. He had to stay a half hour after getting the vaccine since they wanted to monitor him a little longer since he takes blood thinners an other crap. He did not specify the other medications that he takes. On Saturday he felt fine but he felt weak. The patient recovered from dysentery and throwing up on 23Jan2021, while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

I just feel super weak but not like if you have corona. Now, I can sleep under oxygen and it doesn&#39;t bother me anymore and when I get up I don&#39;t need oxygen anymore and I can breathe freely.&#34; Wanted to know how long will his symptoms last. He was as weak as a rag, has a little fever that comes and goes, does not go over 101, stated he was taking Eliquis does not know if that was important or not, slept with oxygen but has not had any trouble breathing.

The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

                                                Vaccine was administered on 1/12/21 at Memory Care. On 1/15/21 at 12:30 he developed slurred speech at his facility and slumped to his left side. Out of concern for stroke he was sent by ambulance to Hospital. There he was found to have no evidence of stroke on MRI or CT angiogram. He was admitted to the hospital due to fever and  elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, CRP) and transaminases. He was found to have a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG. His symptoms resolved the following morning and may have represented a TIA. He had many markers consistent with COVID-19 and his CT pulmonary angiogram did show ground glass opacities but no pulmonary embolism. It was difficult to assess if this was a reinfection with COVID-19, persistent PCR positivity from November, or an adverse event to the vaccine.

Medical history included covid-19 in Jun2020, forgetful from an unknown date, he got a little forgetful sometimes, so he may have forgotten to tell her.  This occurred prior to getting the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Family medical history was none. The patient got the Pfizer COVID vaccine last week on 13Jan2021, he was really sick in Jan2021. The patient had weak legs anyway, but he got so weak.  Weakness in legs started at night on 13Jan2021, around 20:00. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office required. He never complained of any symptoms and did not know if there were other symptoms, because he did not complain.  He fell on Thursday night on 14Jan2021. He got the vaccine around 1:00-1:15pm, and got so weak, that he went to the bathroom and he fell in the floor.  His legs just continued to get worse.  It started on Wednesday night on 13Jan2021.  He could not walk in Jan2021.  Thursday was the worst. By Friday, it started to get better.  He did not get hospitalized.  He could not get up without help. The patient had Covid 19 in Jun2020. He had a lot of symptoms after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The reporter reported her father fell in the bathroom while brushing his teeth and her brother had to come over to get him up. The reporter was starting to wonder if he should take the second dose. The outcome of the events Weakness in legs and fell was resolving and of the other events was unknown. The reporter considered event Weakness in legs was serious due to medically significant and disabling; considered event fall was serious due to medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of the events muscular weakness, fall and gait disturbance cannot be excluded. The events are confounded by the elderly patient&#39;s underlying conditions.

An 88-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 09:45 at SINGLE DOSE in left arm for Prevention. Medical history included Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago, Quadruple Bypass surgery in 2003, High blood pressure. He was Diabetic, was a heart patient. Before he had his ostomy, he had colitis that causes the patient to bleed when pooping and his guts were ravaged. His stomach might be weakened from having it for years and years in his 30&#39;s, 40&#39;s to early 50&#39;s.  Family medical history included Grandfather died at 42 of bleeding ulcer in his stomach. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. He has allergies to pills but was not taking any.  He does not have a fever.  She has the names of the pills he is allergic to as follows: Simvastatin, Lisinopril, Losartan, Aggrenox cap.  They are listed on his report from (institution name withheld) that he has allergies to. He received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 30Jan2021. There was no prescriber on 30Jan2021 through 01Feb2021, everything was good. On 02Feb2021, that is when his ostomy shot out blood like a faucet when he was taking a shower.  He was changing the bandage that day, he was changing his right sided ileostomy bag and he told her that blood shot out of it &#34;like a faucet.&#34; On 3Feb2021 was nerve wracking, but there was no blood.  He was changing his ostomy pad again on 04Feb2021 and it started bleeding so much that he went to the hospital. He was discharged within a few hours because &#34;they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.&#34; He has had colitis for years and has an ileostomy, where they take out a bunch of his colon.  This week he has had some funny bleeding in his ileostomy.  It was spurting out blood.  He had to go to the ER on 4Feb2021 night because it was bleeding and then it stops. People in ER did not know what the bleeding was from.  He was bleeding in the ileostomy on 04Feb2021 and 05Feb2021.  On 05Feb2021 his ostomy bled a little bit more but it has not bled again since 06Feb2021. She also reports that he feels, &#34; icky, tired, no appetite and achy.&#34; The feeling unwell began on 7Feb2021. That worsened since loss of blood made him weaker and worried.  When he got back from the hospital/ER, he said they were rude.  There was a blizzard.  He checked in around 8pm and they discharged him around 11pm that same night.  ER visit at the institution on 04Feb2021, 8pm to 11pm and released. They performed CT scan abdomen and Pelvis and IV. Results are unknown. Now he was good. The achiness and tiredness was between persistent and worsened. He was worrying now. She took his forehead temperature and it was good on 7Feb2021.  She took everybody&#39;s and they were all good.  He just feels icky and the blood thing is nerve wracking. He is convinced it is coming back. He was not on a blood thinner or anything listed on the vaccine fact sheet. The patient experienced Feeling unwell on 6Feb2021 with outcome of Not Recovered (Feeling unwell was reported as worsened), achy and tired on 5Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, No appetite on 7Feb202108:30  with outcome of Not Recovered, Bleeding out of ileostomy on 2Feb2021 09:45 with outcome of Recovering, Did not sleep on 7Feb2021 21:30  with outcome of Not Recovered. He has a lot of the risk factors; He is Diabetic, is a heart patient, and has high blood pressure, but he really wanted to get the shot. The patient&#39;s primary care provider&#39;s nurse do not believe the bleeding had anything to do with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                extremely lightheaded; like he was about to fall down; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported similar events for 2 patients. This is the 1st of 2 reports.  An 89-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number; EL0140), intramuscular on the right arm on 30Dec2020 10:10 at single dose for vaccination.  Medical history included covid-19 on Jul2020 and had it fairly severe and almost died and he mentions he was overweight.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took flu shot (INFLUENZA VACCINE), a couple of months ago. He mentions he was in the military so he had a lots of shots in his life but he has never had a reaction like this.  The patient stated that on 30Dec2020 10:30, &#34;he became extremely lightheaded, like he was about to fall down. He sat down and is currently sitting down. This lightheadedness started about 20 minutes after the injection. When probed for the outcome, the caller explains it might be improving a little. The lightheadedness is not still not gone, but it has not worsened.  When probed for seriousness criteria, the caller explains he is just resting and sitting. He would say its not serious but it could be medically significant. He states he isn&#39;t sure if this is something that happens to just people who have had COVID before. He states none of his friends or relatives have this type of reaction. He lives in a retirement home and everybody is getting the injection. This is the second day of injections. He doesn&#39;t know if anybody had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine here&#34;. The outcome of the events were recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of lightheadedness and pre-syncope due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.   This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2020520862 same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient.
