The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function.

I have been in remission for 6 weeks after a one week reaction to St Johns Wort, but before that was in remission for a year or two. 25 hours after getting the covid vaccine last week, I started getting burning nerves, tingling, and pins and needles, which has only gotten worse in the last 3 days. There were no symptoms of this right before the vaccine.

A 40-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EK4176), via intramuscular on 09Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EJ1685), via intramuscular on 22Dec2020 at single dose in left arm at the age of 39-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. Reported he was diagnosed with Guillain Barre syndrome. Symptoms started with 2 fingers tingling on 11Jan2021. Progressively increasing in severity. Now had numb fingers and toes. Initiating IV therapy on 22Jan2021. The adverse event result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.

Troponin levels were at 6.0 and I had a small abnormal finding on my EKG. The Cardiovascular physician on call said it could be something and they would do a cardiac cath to determine where a blockage may be. The angiogram cam back with no blockages. troponin levels reached a 10 by the end of the first day. The Echo the next day showed no issues in structure. The Cardiac MRI showed fluid and 4% of my heart had myocarditis from the issue. Troponin levels reduced to 7, then 6 by the end of the second day. On the third day I went home with new meds, an order for a follow up and cardiac rehab.

On 1/11/21 the headache  worsened to 4/10 and was associated with myalgias and neck stiffness.  After a jog, I was in the shower and noticed a rash all over my body that had been pruritic.  I went to the ER that night where I tested negative for flu A/B and also tested negative for covid (Antigen then PCR).  Got a CMP, CBC, and coags to rule out ITP.  everything was normal.  The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

                                                Patient screened for first dose of Pfizer vaccine. He checked no history of allergies or reactions to medications or vaccines. In the initial screening he informed me he had a phobia of needles but this is usually with blood draws. He reported he should be fine with vaccinations. I inquired on previous reactions and he denied any allergic reaction just that he does not like them. I asked him how I can help give the vaccine. We had him look away and to think of a different situation. I asked him if he would like to know when I am administering or just use distraction. He chose to be informed when he would feel a slight poke. Vaccine was administered with no issues.  Within the minute following the vaccine patient started to feel dizzy. Hung his head a bit but was responsive. I requested staff assistance to help the situation including RN to prevent any episodes of syncope.  We provided water which he was able to drink. He was still seated and we suggested putting head between legs. This was not comfortable for him so we moved him to the floor. About 3-4 min in he began to sweat a bit more and appeared Pale. We obtained a BP and pulse. BP was 112/60 and pulse around 60.  When he felt hot, sweaty and appeared pale we all decided to call EMS to be cautious. He maintained BP, no SOB, did not lose conscious. EMS evaluated him, med list provided and vitals. He was on medications for anxiety.  They released him after about 30min and reported a panic attack and not related to the vaccine.  Patient walked out of the clinic with his partner and was stable. He is requesting 2nd dose of the vaccine. I informed him nurse would review and would have a plan for future injection.

But as I walked out to my car I quickly got heavy and tired and started to ache and have a headache. I had to rest in my car for a while before driving home. Once home I crashed immediately for around 4 hours in the middle of the day which is not like me. I had an important dinner meeting i had to attend for my livelihood. I thought I was feeling better but half way through Dinner  I started feeling bad again. Got to the point that I stopped eating and excused myself to get home and rest. Symptoms progressed rapidly. Unfortunately I was pulled over for a minor traffic stop and  tried to explain that I was having a bad reaction to the vaccine and needed to get home. They wouldn?t believe me  and torturously treated me like an OVI. I?m hoping that I can get some kind of documentation and or assistance. I have court on the 1st and it will be devastating if I am convicted. I was not intoxicated  and was not warned about the dangers of driving after the vaccine. Please call me. I need help

The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner.

Hypothermia.  Couldn&#39;t get warm.  It&#39;s like my body forgot  how to regulate temperature. I&#39;ve only ever experienced similar coming out of anesthesia after surgery.  Took wearing multiple layers of clothes AND multiple blankets just to stabilize my body temp.  It lasted for around 2-3 hours.  This wasn&#39;t normal &#34;chills&#34;.  This was whole-body shaking hypothermia.  Entire body sore afterwards from the involuntary shaking.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get an actual reading as anything to measure body temp was downstairs and I didn&#39;t want to risk falling.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

Felt better by 02/14/2021. Began feeling ill again on 02/17/2021, body aches, extreme fatigue, feeling very hot but not having a fever, nausea. It seemed to get better on about 02/21/2021, but then on 02/22/2021, all of the same feelings and symptoms came back and are still present today. I have reached out to my primary doctor to let him know and he suggested that I submit this information here as well.

They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

                                                Woke up in the morning with soreness in wrist and elbow and practically zero use of my left hand.  Woke up on left side so just assumed hand was asleep.  After 15 minutes of no improvement,  I started to panic thinking I was having a stroke.   Realizing I had no other symptoms and was feeling fine otherwise I knew that likely wasn&#39;t the case. Besides having zero strength (I did have feeling) my hand would curl inward toward my body.  I could manipulate with my right hand by it would always curl back in. I was barely able to grip, would actually have to manipulate my fingers into a grasp, couldn&#39;t do it on it&#39;s own, and holding something as light as my cellphone would cause my hand to turn down towards the floor. Pain level I would only describe as soreness in my wrist and elbow.  Annoying but not painful. It&#39;s now over 24 hours since symptoms first appeared and besides some slight weakness in the hand I would say I&#39;m 95% better.

                                                myositis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 43-year-old male patient received  first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown) on an unspecified date in Dec2020 reported as around the end of December,  at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date after he received the vaccine he had right arm pain and swelling (states it was in his bicep brachial radialis in the muscle) which is the opposite arm of the injection site. He had an MRI done on an unknown date that showed myositis. He thinks could be due to the vaccine since it started two days after he received the vaccine. His pain peaked at about a week and a half and now the pain was improving and the swelling was down. He still had function in the right arm but when he strained it would hurt. His concern was that the reaction may be an autoimmune reaction and the first response was muted. He was worried the second dose may elicit a larger response. At the time of the reporting the patient was recovering from the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between the myositis and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. Additional information regarding onset latency, relevant medical history, concomitant medications and detailed clinical course around the event onset will aid in comprehensive assessment of the case. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 43-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left shoulder on 06Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 protection.

Outcome of the event heart racing was recovering while for face felt hot was recovered on the same day of 07Jan2021, and for the remaining event was unknown.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

After several hours of sleep I got out of bed around 0600 and noticed severe body and joint ache and a headache. Once I began moving around I also noticed I would fatigue very quickly. Reminded me of how one feels when they get a good case of the Flu. As the day progressed all symptoms lessened in severity and I went to bed at about 20% of what I felt that morning. I woke the following morning and felt no residual symptoms.

                                                coughing quite a bit; seizure; his whole body feels sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 43-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3248) in right deltoid, on 11Jan2021 around 10:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was in high risk group, was living in senior facility and was disabled. Medical history included also ongoing hydrocephalus diagnosed when he was less than a year old, ongoing shunt (the first one when he was 11 months old, has had multiple revisions since then, the last in 2017), vagal nerve stimulator implantation ongoing from 2003 (for epilepsy; has had multiple since then, last one in 2015), ongoing hemiparesis since he was a baby and epilepsy (he was taking epilepsy drugs but it was well controlled). Concomitant medications included oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) ongoing from 2000, at 1800 mg daily (600 mg in the morning and 1200 mg at night), for epilepsy and levetiracetam (KEPPRA XR) ongoing from 2000, at 1500 mg twice daily (in the morning and at night), for epilepsy. He was on prior medications to these, since he was young. Over the years he has changed to newer and better medications. On 11Jan2021 around 8-9 PM the patient experienced seizure. The patient has not had a grand mal seizure in over 5 years. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, after the vaccine, his whole body felt sore. He was unsure if it was from the seizure or the vaccine. The reporter also noticed that the patient had been coughing quite a bit on 12Jan2021 morning. Events outcomes were unknown.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                As soon as I received the shot and went into the waiting area, I experienced a tingling sensation down my right arm where the injection was administered. Throughout the 15 minutes the sensation began to radiate throughout my body and extremities. I waited about 20 minutes before deciding to leave the facility and proceed with my afternoon.  Once I got home, I experienced chills, which I read on the pamphlet was an expected side effect. Both hands and feet were cold and I put on additional layers and lied on the couch and rested. During that time I began to notice the tingling sensation/paresthesia predominantly in the injected (right) arm, but also sporadically in other parts of my body including thigh (front/back), left arm, elbow, back, torso, neck, head, wrists, buttocks, etc. This sensation continued as I prepared for bed and continues as of this writing.  It&#39;s difficult to say whether the sensation is getting better or worse, but it is consistent best described as someone pricking you every so often.

I had trouble getting warm and had to utilize multiple blankets to gain heat, which is not normal.  I was very warm and most likely developed a fever.  I did not eat until 2 PM that day and the started feeling better later that night.  I was forced to miss work to recover.  I returned to work today, 1/28 but I remain tired and a little lethargic.

This 44-year-old Nurse (Patient) reported that he received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) at single dose for vaccination in Jan2021 around 9:45am. Relevant medical history included ongoing Mild shrimp allergy  and ongoing Hypertension. Relevant concomitant drugs included amlodipine at 10 mg once daily for Hypertension since Feb2020 and ongoing. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None.  Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was None. The patient was administered the COVID Vaccine around 9:45am; about 10 minutes later he had onset of little muscle twitches on the left side of his body that started in the calf then the glute, then the quadricep, then the bicep and then just started bouncing around everywhere on left side. Approximately a half an hour after that those little muscle twitches started on the right side of his body. Now the little muscle twitches are just everywhere; his hand, his heel, right now as he is speaking he is having the little muscle twitches in his heel; This event has been ongoing since onset; but changed today around 5:00am when he felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines which is probably impossible, but it feels like it is not just muscular now, like it is happening in his intestines which concerns him. The little muscle twitches do not hurt, he thinks that is probably why he has waited a week to call; but the fact that they are ongoing and changed today, worsened is unsettling. He reported since that first dose of COVID Vaccine was administered he has also had low grade fever; muscle soreness; muscle tiredness. He reported that a rapid response team was called immediately because of the initial reaction he had. Later that day his hands were a little shaky, he got very diaphoretic and the nurses on the unit of the hospital said he almost fell which he does not recall at all; in response to those events he was taken to the emergency department where they did a complete workup including labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), checked his heart and everything was fine; no notable results from any of those tests. The patient was not admitted to the hospital; under observation in emergency room only. Outcome of events Little muscle twitches, Low grade fever, Muscle soreness and Muscle soreness was not resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

He is currently a highway patrol officer. While driving in his patrol car, at 1035, he felt tightness in the back of his neck and tightness to his airway- he described it feeling like someone hit him in the neck. He denied having any trouble breathing. Later, he noted his hand was twitching. 1045, he came back to lobby and made an RN aware who brought him to employee health. He declined to go to ED (I found out later).  BP was 153/115 HR 102  initially, no hx of high bp.  No noted hives or swelling to face or mouth/tongue or L deltoid region.  Pt. denied feeling any itching anywhere.  Pt. rested for about 15 minutes on exam table. Re-check of BP was 151/113 HR 84.  Pt. states he feels better and feel like that feeling of tightness in his neck is decreasing.   Made aware to follow up with PCP regarding BP and giving informational handout regarding blood pressure.  RN recommended he go to any ED if he has any trouble breathing, swelling of tongue, etc at any time after he leaves this hospital. Pt. verbalized understanding.

                                                On the 8th day after shot I started getting pain under left armpit. The pain became worse over the next several days resulting in what I&#39;d describe as an electrical shock/burning feeling whenever I moved my left arm the wrong way (seemingly pinching the lymph nodes). I&#39;m currently on day 5 of the pain and it&#39;s still present although it has lessened on the 5th day. On the 2nd day the pain started to move down from the armpit closer to the pectoral.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

                                                While on duty and in uniform as an emergency paramedic I received my second  scheduled covid19 vaccination.  Approximately five minutes after receiving  C19 dose 2 vaccination (1335hrs). I experienced a syncopal episode while walking back to my work area and was lowered to the ground by another EMS provider. I was then placed in a wheelchair by the  EMS provider and an RN and taken to the emergency department at Medical Center. (1337hrs)  I  regained alertness and felt severe nausea and general weakness and was assisted into in ER bed.  Staff doctor attended along with RN . An assessment was completed, 12 lead EKG completed, IV established, 8mg Zofran administered, 1000ml of Normal Saline was bolused. Labs were drawn.  ED staff continued to monitor me for the next  2 plus hours I was monitored for anaphylaxis and other symptoms. My symptoms of nausea mostly resolved and my strength returned.  A Resident MD completed a final evaluation and determined it was safe for me to be discharged. (1607hrs)

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 45-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Batch/lot number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 13Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced fatigue on 17Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, achiness in his legs and hands on 18Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, chills on 18Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, injection site swelling and achiness on 13Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Jan2021. The patient reported after he got the first COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 he experienced fatigue, achiness, and injection site swelling. Patient wanted to know if this is normal after the first dose and this was discussed. Patient explained that the fatigue - this didn&#39;t start until 17Jan2021 and was ongoing. On 18Jan2021 he starting having achiness in his legs and hands and he also had a few chills today. The injection site swelling and achiness there, was gone after the 14Jan2021. Patient was really looking for an answer to his question on if it was normal or should he get a COVID test. He was on day 5 after getting the vaccine and from what he read most people have side effects within a 24 hours and gone within 48 hours. Some of his side effect didn&#39;t start until 4 days later. The Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Patient did not go to Emergency Room or Physician Office. There was no Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks).

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 45-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at 11:00 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing systemic lupus erythematosus (Lupus), ongoing hypertension (High Blood Pressure), ongoing gout and hip arthroplasty from Dec2020 to an unknown date; all diagnosed about 20 years ago. Concomitant medications included allopurinol, atorvastatin, benzonatate, chlorthalidone, apixaban (ELIQUIS), hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (HYDROCODONE/ACETAMINOPHEN), hydroxychloroquine, iron, loratadine, losartan potassium, mycophenolate mofetil, omeprazole, paricalcitol, prednisone, spironolactone and valacyclovir [valaciclovir] and vitamin D NOS. The reporter&#39;s husband had a reaction to the vaccine. She was wondering if it is ok to have the second dose. He got paralysis, Bell&#39;s Palsy on 14Feb2021. She clarified vaccine as COVID19 Vaccine. She would like any information available about second dose after having Bell&#39;s Palsy with the first dose. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

                                                He stated he was fine for 20 minutes after the administration, but noticed driving home that the left side of his face felt funny/tingly. He says it progressed that evening to numbness and states his spouse noticed slight swelling to his face. He also complained of pain to his teeth and gums. He voiced concerns about bell&#39;s palsy, but stated he didn&#39;t notice any asymmetry or paralysis in his face and his symptoms have resolved entirely as of today 1/4. He was never seen or evaluated while he was having symptoms, unfortunately, and was able to continue working. Denied chest pain or difficulty breathing, no rash. He reports self-medicating with prednisone on sat/sun with improvement and as mentioned, is now asymptomatic.

                                                Difficult to determine if this event was related to vaccination.  46 y.o. male with a pertinent interval and past history of HTN, sponge kidney, ckd, gerd and HLD.  Presents to ED with worsening redness and tenderness of his right upper mid thigh.  Patient states that he got the Pfizer vaccination yesterday second shot evening and then developed some subjective fevers sweats and chills.  Also had myalgias this all lasted approximately 2 hours but he was able to get to bed and fall asleep.  Woke up this morning feeling better but still with some chills but noticed some tenderness and redness in his right upper mid thigh.  This got progressively worse.  Continues to have chills but improving.    ED work-up including CBC unremarkable, CMP with mild hyponatremia and hypokalemia of 134 and 3.4 respectively.  ED drew blood cultures and then started vancomycin.  Vitals normal and stable in ED.  Admitted to hospital.  Provider notes on 2nd day of admission as follows.  Cellulitis and abscess of the right medial thigh likely secondary to a skin tag tear which introduced infection.  Patient currently is on broad-spectrum antibiotics in the form of doxycycline and vancomycin.  Unfortunately, the patient has been eating just ate lunch and also has been getting Lovenox.  He is not going to tolerate a bedside incision and drainage.  We will plan on proceeding to the operating room tomorrow for quick I&amp;D and cultures.  Procedures been explained.  The wound will need to be packed afterwards and ultimately healed in.  Patient seems understand plan and we will proceed accordingly

                                                I have never had a seizure in my life before or since, but that morning I had five partial focal seizures in y right arm, over the course of six minutes.  As I was on the phone (to report the first one to my caregiver) when the second hit, I inadvertently punched myself rapidly and repeatedly in the right side of my head, with the phone handset functioning as an impromptu bludgeon, leaving bruises reminiscent of the victim of a fist fight.  Also at the time I had a strong headache, cold chills, a 102 degree Fahrenheit fever and body aches.  None of which persisted beyond noon.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

But the second dose of this vaccine (on 2/7/2021) was different. In addition to the severe pain on my left arm, I had (and still) a severe headache, pains all over my body and bones, high fever (102), dizziness, shaking, fatigue, cold at all times, and a little bit taste loss (as of right now, 24 hours after the vaccine). It looks like a hard flu symptoms exactly.

                                                On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

January 9  - ER - Diagnosed cellulitis - round of Ceflex for a week - things got worse. Since January 9, I&#39;ve had two other separate ER visits and three rounds of CEFLEX. Was referred to Dermatology - Arrhythmia Nodusem  - so now I&#39;m off Ceflex and on a steroid regimen now. I just started it today. It hurts to even touch my skin and it hurts to walk.I&#39;m in  a lot of pain. I have no open wounds so no reason for this to happen.

A 46-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 27Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack (at the age of 39) and had couple of stents (and the things done) later after that, and Lyme disease (past this Summer). The patient was taking several concomitant medications (unspecified). The patient&#39;s mother was calling for her son (patient) as he works out on the road, but he has had a heart attack at 39 years old and has had some other problems. The patient got his first Pfizer shot and about 2 to 3 days later while he was working, he first just had the sore arm on 03Mar2021. The patient worked in fiber glass repair on pools and it was very warm, and he started having muscle cramps all over the body on 03Mar2021. The patient ended up in the hospital on 03Mar2021 and his sugar was very high, and he was dehydrated. As treatment taken for the events, they gave him fluids through an IV and they gave him metformin medication 500 mg. The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures (his doctor did the laboratory work), and they did laboratory work at the hospital where he went. It was clarified that they just did blood work on 03Mar2021, but the patient&#39;s mother didn&#39;t know what it was. The patient was just held for observation and was out the next day (04Mar2021). That was only the first shot, so the patient was really afraid to get the second shot one. The patient&#39;s mother told him she will try to find out something about it. patient&#39;s mother looked up the side effects and she did not see that as a side effect. At the time of reporting, the patient still had cramps once in a while. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Muscle cramps all over the body&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

The next day around lunch time the hives came back again I had a very red and tingling area around my neck and in my head. I returned to the walk in clinic and they gave me shot of Benadryl and prednisone and another drug I do not remember.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

This 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; borderline diabetes. Concomitant medications included losartan; alirocumab (PRALUENT, injection) on 20Jan2021. Since 23Jan2021, patient was dizzy all along and almost fainted and was still having symptoms of mild migraine and he don&#39;t know like some light sensitivity. Doctor believed it was from vaccine. Patient was wondering how long was this going to be last as he had second shot coming out. He didn&#39;t think it was an adverse reaction and he thought he should get the second shot. But this was continuing to me and it had already been two weeks and patient still having symptoms of mild migraine. Patient was worried about taking the second shot as a result. He had never had a migraine before and was told it was probably from the vaccine and that was not something he wanted to hear. Patient wanted to know if this was normal to still be having this side effect for this long. Patient was taking acetaminophen (for migraine), it was not a TYLENOL, it was from a different brand. Patient did liver and cholesterol test and blood test in Jan2021 at Cardiologist and they came back fine, nothing was found there. The outcome of event migraine was not resolved. The outcome of rest events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.

                                                I had right sided headache for the first two days, then resolved.  The right sided headaches recurred along with right tongue numbness initially on 12/29/2020.  The symptoms worsen on 12/31/2020 and severe on 1/1/2021.  I was initially started on Valtrex thinking it maybe due to shingles but soon with the right sided facial paralysis, it was obvious it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and was started on steriods on 1/1/21 and also received acupuncture treatment on 1/2/21 which significant help improve the symptoms.  I still have some residual weakness of the right eye with some tearing and mouth weakness.

                                                Hypertensive crisis; Numbness to my left ear; progressively it went down to my mandible, my face and my left  shoulder numbness; Radial blood pressure cough; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting for himself. A 48-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. During the administration the patient did experience some types of reaction where it wanted medical supervision. So, basically when he did got the injection he was waiting for his 15 minute prolapse. But within probably he would say 7 to 8 minutes he started to experiencing some numbness to his left ear and usually he thought it was secondary to the that he had (not clarified) but progressively it went down to his mandible, his face and his left  shoulder numbness and he was experiencing some numbness that radiate towards his fingertips only to the left side. At that time he waived to the Nurse to supervise and at that time he wait again and a Physician came over. He checked his pulse and noted that he had normal rhythm during the pulse check and at that time and he had Emergency medical technician (EMT) come over. The EMT checked his blood pressure he thought multiple times through the left and to the right brachial. He was having what they would consider a hypertensive crisis where systolic were in 170&#39;s, 180&#39;s, diastolic numbers were between like 120&#39;s and 130&#39;s and his heart rate was in 70&#39;s. So, initially it was not anxiety induced. But he do not have no blood pressure. They wanted he to go to the hospital to treat the hypertensive crisis that was in. The patient opted not to. So he went home in a quieter environment he did have a radial blood pressure cough that he had been checking his blood pressure rigorously, tried different techniques and now he was back to normal state to 120-130 systolic and his diastolic was 70-80. This instance was weird that he did not see as a part of one of the side effects listed with Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine. No treatment received for the events, because he had no history of hypertension it was just more of decreasing the ambient around he. At that time he wanted to go to a quiet environment, took a shower and check his blood pressure. He did orthostatic while laying down sitting up, standing up and he was not hypertensive. For the causality, the nurse stated, &#34;I think it did. This is a fact I mean I was doing fine prior to administration and then this event is slowly subsiding.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported hypertensive crisis cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                woke up this morning feeling slight numbness on my left cheek.  The sensation is very similar to when I receive a numbing shot from my dentist for dental work.  The feeling of numbness comes and goes with varying levels of intensity.  Sometimes twitching my cheek can make it go away; but it keeps occurring.

I left the hospital, start driving, and suddenly felt that my right arm was heavy, numb, with a tingling sensation. I stopped the car and called the nurse and I was told that it will go away, and I can take a tylenol/motrin. It improved over the next hour and I felt it resolved a few days later but then it returned on 1/18 but not to the same extent, and I also felt intermittent tingling and numbing in my right foot. I also experienced intermittent episodes of fast heartbeats and missing heartbeats since the vaccine almost daily. I was fatigued and extremely thirsty for 3 days but that resolved completely.

                                                8 minutes after the vaccine i satrt to experience some tingling to my left earlobe. It then radiated to my left jaw line where i felt an onset of numbness. the numbness hten radited to my left shoulder all the way down to my left extrremity digits. atthat time i waived over a nurse who waived a physician who check my radial pulse, pulse was noted in the 70&#39;s. At that time the physician  asked a EMT perofrmed four evalautions of my BP and my BP was reading syttolically between was 140-150 and my datolics was reading 110-115. Throughout that time the numbness was still to my left side of my face and shoulder and arm and to myfingers. This was only localized to those two areas.  At that time it was requested for me to go to the hospital to seek medical attention. I deferrred to going home to check my BP and at that time i was running 150/100.  The numbness was still present and mu thought process my body was stressed out. I then took a nice cold shower with breathing techniques. I did orthastatics on myself. I then followed with my PCP the next day and she ordered bunch of labs, CRP, triponents, CBC, bubble study and chest x-ray and EKG. ALl the testes were deemed to be negative.  My systolics were 120/80 when i saw my PCP, however i was recommedned to take the whole week off and was recommended to go back to work after the new year.  After five days the numbness went away to my digits went away but not to my face.  My grips were equal. I had no Bal palsy nor stroke.  The numbness sill persisted up till day 9 and the umbness to the face went away.

The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes under left armpit were severely inflamed when I woke up on Saturday 2/06/2021. 1-2 days later I had severe pain on my Left back- ended up being my brachial plexus nerve. Few days after that I developed numbness and weakness on my left side and pins and needles in my Left index finger. I saw my primary care doctor twice that week. He started me on low dose Prednisone and gabapentin for the pain while sleeping. When the nerve pain/numbness did not subside, I asked for a neurology referral. Two doctors saw me for brachial plexus neuritis. I have had 2 ultrasound guided and one fluoro guided cortisone shots along the nerve. I have also been going to PT 2-3 x/week to regain my strength on the Left side &amp; calm nerve.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EL0142) intramuscularly at right shoulder approximately at 17:30 on 29Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity (a little over weight but he is fit). The patient had COVID in the end of Apr2020. The patient had no family medical history and had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no concomitant medication. The second day of the vaccination, the patient called to report body aches, headache, chills, low grade temperature. As he reported, he just woke up and was walking around feeling like he had 1000 pounds on his back and felt like crap. The body aches started in his shoulder and currently all over his neck, back and whole body aches. Chills started last night (vaccination night). He was just trying to get to sleep and had to put an extra sweatshirt on last night. He did not check his temperature until he got up and it was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit. He was not able to provide a start date for the temperature. &#34;Body aches, headache between, chills between, low grade temperature (unspecified start date), feels like crap&#34; were considered developing between 24:00-01:00. He stated that they were all medically significant and he needs a day to recover hopefully. He just felt like he was hit by a truck. The patient had not visited physician or went to ER yet. The outcome of low grade temperature was unknown, chills was resolving and all other events did not resolve at the time of reporting.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events vaccination site pain, headache, chills, and pyrexia were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. The association between the other reported events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded based on temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Those symptoms persisted for approximately 12 hours after which I continued to experience injection site pain, but began to experience pain with some numbness that radiated from the injection site distally down my arm and into my pinky and ring fingers on my left hand.  No other symptoms.  As of today the injection site pain persists as does the pain and numbness in my pinky and ring fingers, but I get the feeling that it is getting slightly worse.  The pain and slight numbness is present when I awake, but gets worse throughout the day.  Some evenings there is considerable discomfort.

                                                On 1/18/2021, at approximately 02:00 AM, I woke up with extreme pain in my right arm. The pain radiates from the shoulder/bicep down to the forearm. The pain did not subside until later in the evening. I continued to have discomfort and pain on and off throughout the week. On 1/25/2021, I again woke up with extreme pain in my right arm. I have tried ibuprofen and different arm positions to reduce the pain and discomfort without any luck. The arm is tender/sore.  I am not sure if this is a reaction to the vaccine or if the needle protruded too far when administered.  I have an MRI scheduled to rule out any type of injury.

This 49-year-old male patient received his first dose of intramuscular BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 28Dec202 at 17:30 in left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 49-year-old. Lot number was EK9231. Medical history included gout. Concomitant medications were unknown. On 10Jan2021, the patient experienced Pressured Speech, weakness and tremors to both limbs and muscle spasm. The events resulted in Emergency room/ department or urgent care and Hospitalization for one day. The patient was not treated for the events. COVID was tested post vaccination on 13Jan2021, Nasal Swab, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and it resulted negative. The patient did not recover from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events pressured speech, weakness and tremors to both limbs ,muscle spasm are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 administration given the weak time association. The available examination results would be helpful for further assessment.

                                                Early Wednesday morning (2/24) around 5:00AM, I woke up to extreme pain in my left arm, primarily along the upper forearm, inside of my elbow, and lower bicep. There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They&#39;ve prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week. The right arm pain is less than the left arm pain, but at this point seven days later, I am experiencing neuropathic pain in both arms.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

Commuted to work without issue. ~ 1400: As day progressed, nausea subsided, but fatigue grew more profound and developed pain in the right subscapular area with exertional shortness of breath walking any length of time. (Injection of initial and second doses were both in right deltoid). 1540 - 1800: Fatigue increased, developed a burning/tearing pain with every yawn and deep breath from the top of my trachea into both left and right mainstem bronchi and radiated to right arm.  It literally felt like someone was trying to tear out my bronchial tree with each breath. 1800: Arrived home and medicated self-medicated with Motrin 400mg. 1800 -2030: rested at home with still some breathing pain, no shortness of breath, but incredibly tired. 2045: Went to bed and slept for the next 12.5 hours without any issued during the night. 0800: Woke up nearly all symptoms were gone, only some minor residual fatigue.  No breathing pain, no nausea, no subscapular pain. I did not seek medical attention for symptoms, nor did I contact my provider. I experienced fatigue and a headache with the first dose, but no other symptoms.  I never experienced fever or chills

The patient has no medical history and no known allergies . There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first vaccine of bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020, at 12:00 PM, Intramuscular, on the Right arm for Covid-19 immunization, he had numbness in his right hand x2 days. On 09Jan2021, following second dose, he has had numbness in both hands x2 days and on 10Jan2021, day 2, he ran a fever and his lighter weight facial fillers swelled and were painful (around the eyes - not my lip fillers). His eyes have a mix of Juvaderm products. It spontaneously resolved after 1 day with a subjective loss in overall volume. Density of the product used seemed to be a factor in the response. He knows this has been reported with the Moderna product, but he does not believe is has been reported with our product. It appears the response may not be product specific, but more specific to the type of vaccine. The patient has no Covid prior vaccination and not covid tested post vaccination. No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2020.

About 25 minutes after the injection, I was concerned (possibly too anxious) and I decided to return to the site. I crossed the bridge and sat down at the bridge gate. The personnel there called an EMT, and about 15 minutes later the EMT came to talk to me and take my blood pressure and pulse Oxygen. Blood pressure was 137 - 87. Pulse Ox was 100%. By that time I had calmed down the sensation in my legs had eased. Approximately 2 hours after the injection I began to feel soreness in my joints (and this did not pre-occupy me, since I knew that feeling the beginning of aches and pains a couple hours after injection is normal). It is now 6 hours and 32 minutes after the injection, and I am feeling ok. It was quite probably anxiety on my end. The folks in city were very nice to me at the pedestrian bridge gate. I have noted talking the EMT below as health professional visit, I also plan to go see Dr. prior to the 2nd shot.

                                                I have experienced low-level numbness/tingling in my left hand; primarily in my thumb and index finger. Range of motion has been normal. No pain either. Strangely it began 1 week after my first injection. It was intermittent in the time after that and before the 2nd injection. On the day of the second injection I experienced renewed symptoms in the same hand immediately after receiving my 2nd dose. I spoke with the attending physician at the time and was told that she had heard about some instances of numbness but it would probably fade with time. Unfortunately I am now over 2 weeks since the second dose was administered and my symptoms have been nearly constant and do not appear to be waning.

Then numbness also affected left side of face and neck and left anterior chest wall.  Intermittent pain in chest wall with intermittent resolve of numbness.  The worst of it lasted a week.  After a week, numbness started to resolve, but still have residual numbness in left hand.  Did have headaches as well for that week and then headaches resolved after a week.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

ANA titer was 1:40 with speckled and cytoplasma pattern.   My last ANA was negative when tested for inflammation due to back pain few years prior.     Neurologist  did not think this was an allergic reaction and since symptoms were gradually improving recommended second dose.   Symptoms fully resolved after 2 weeks  Dose 2 - Jan 19 , 2021 (21 days post) -  Decided to inject left deltoid to avoid trauma to right arm.     Was observed 30 mins and released.   No symptoms.

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

Both IM through my left arm. Directly for about less 48H post vaccination I had muscle pain that were self-resolved.  On Jan 18, 2021, I started having funny sensation (like having a foreign body) over my left eye medial /innercantus area. The next 2 days I started to have pain over my left external ear canal, then it progressed into pain over my left lower jaw, left vertex of my head, inner side of left eye. My SS progressed on 1/30/21 at around 3:30 PM to numbness over my left sided tongue and left sided lip. Then on 1/31/21 at around 5 AM, I started having left facial paralysis. I have left BELL&#39;s PALSY which was confirmed. following a negative non-contrast brain MRI to rule out stroke and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR test. I start taking Prednisone 60 mg daily and Acyclovir 1 g TID on Jan 31, 2021. To this date I still have left facial paralysis but not worsening.

When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach.

He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 29Dec2020 at 15:00 PM (at the age of 51 years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sciatica. There was no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 29Dec2020, within 4 hours of vaccination, the patient developed paresthesia&#39;s in right arm, into axilla, neck and right side of face, burning irritation of right eye. The patient was evaluated by neurologist. No treatment given. Symptoms resolved in 10 days. The clinical outcome of the events paresthesia&#39;s in right arm, into axilla, neck and right side of face, burning irritation of right eye was recovered on 08Jan2021. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

                                                Shortly after receiving the injection my arm went ice cold all the way to my fingers and warmed up again quickly. On the way home (about an hour later) I noticed numbness and tingling in my hand and that has continued since (11 days as of this report). My upper arm muscle was sore later that evening and by the next day the pain in my upper arm was extreme. I couldn&#39;t move my arm without extreme pain. I took some tylenol late in the day and that did help cut down on some of the pain. I also put an ice pack on my upper arm but it didn&#39;t help. The pain wasn&#39;t as bad the next (3rd) day but it&#39;s still significant enough for me to restrict activity with it. There is also a burning sensation off and on as well as itching deep in my arm. My upper arm has also felt like there is a tight band around it (since day 2) although the muscles themselves don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s any tightness or knots. I took ibuprofen on day 10 and it helped a little but not a whole lot. At this point I also have what feels like swelling or tenderness under my arm near the armpit area. The pain, burning and itching in my upper arm continues as well as the numbness, tingling and pins all up and down my arm to my hand and fingers.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 08:48 am (lot number: EN6199) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included facial paralysis from 20Jan2021 to an unknown date diagnosed initially as bell&#39;s palsy but now is diagnosed as myasthenia gravis and gastric reflux. Concomitant medication included unspecified gastric reflux medication and unspecified vitamins. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior and did not receive other vaccine on the same day. The patient previously he was put on prednisone 60 mg tablets by mouth times 7 days, then 10 mg tablets for an additional 7 days. The patient mentioned he received the vaccine in a vaccination center. The patient reported that prior to his first shot towards the end of Jan2021, his doctor thought he had Bell&#39;s Palsy. On 20Jan2021, he stated that he was put on a high dose of steroids to clear it up. He stated that on 09Mar2021, he had his first Covid vaccine with no issues. On 12Mar2021 between 5-6 pm, he mentioned that it came back (the Bell&#39;s Palsy) with a vengeance, near his eye and with eye droop. He specifies left eye droop. He added that the Monday after (15Mar2021) over the weekend, it got worse. He mentioned that he talked with his neurologist who told him to speak with his ophthalmologist who the patient spoke to on Tuesday. The patient mentioned that both doctors came up with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. He inquired since one of his doctor&#39;s is concerned about him taking the second vaccine and the other doctor was ok with it. He mentioned that one doctor had a feeling of some bias, and the other doctor. He did some research in an association with people diagnosed with it. One of his doctors said that he is immunocompromised, so he looked at autoimmune information, and the information says it is ok. He reached out to the local medical center that is doing the vaccination and they are unwilling to talk with him over the phone. He has read on the association site and they seem to recommend to take it. He did not want to rebel against his doctor, so he wants to be sure. He inquired if it was safe for him to take his second dose and wanted to get good factual information that can give him a good starting point that is related. He mentioned that his second dose schedule was on 30Mar2021. He also stated that initial onset of Bell&#39;s Palsy with left eye droop, he was on a high dose steroid regimen and that seem to help which he finished up early Feb2021. It was mentioned that the event initial onset was not after the vaccine. The Ophthalmologist checked him on Tuesday and his left eye which he could barely open, and his doctor also noticed right eye droop. He stated without medication, it is worsening but with his medication, it is definitely helping to transmit between nerves. He stated before the medication this time of day he could not lift his left eye longer throughout the day, the more difficult it is for the muscles as they become weaker. There was noticeably drooping of the right eye. The ophthalmologist exam on his right eye was drooping which was ongoing. It is still there, his wife and he were comparing their eyes and how much he could open it, and it surprised them how little he could open it. It was different and strange. The time reported for the drooping of the right eye was 2:30 pm and persisting but the left eye was worse. He hasn&#39;t noticed a difference about the same, medication has been helping. It was also mentioned that myasthenia gravis reported that it started on the 16Mar2021 2:30 pm (talked to the Neurologist to compare notes, so maybe 3:30 - 4:00) when they made the initial diagnosis and started testing the next day. He is waiting for blood work to come back, but all the tests have pointed in that direction. Myasthenia gravis was ongoing, but the condition has worsened and the medications at a therapeutic level, it keeps it at bay. He further added that his eye became so hard to see, so he pyridostigmine bromide on 17Mar2021 since he couldn&#39;t open or focus, he thought he would give it a try. It works when he can&#39;t focus and if he doesn&#39;t take, it he will go back to where he was before. He will not be able to open his eye and the double vision will come back. The events required physician&#39;s office visit but did not require emergency room visit. He mentioned that there were 3 test and one more scheduled. The first one was a common test; the first initial test diagnose Myasthenia gravis. The second test was the ice test since they went on the assumption in their initial thinking it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and in his, doctor&#39;s, opinion it didn&#39;t look right. The test sounds goofy and it is one of the tests, they did to predict how it was going to go. He reported that they placed an ice cube in a cloth on the eye and let cool for 2-3 minutes. The eye lid is raised more than it was before the test and it went back down. This test was done on 16Mar2021. He reported that the did a chest x-ray on 17Mar2021 and looked for enlarge thalamus, he states it was normal. He has a CT scheduled next Wednesday (24Mar2021) to check his thalamus and lungs. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test with unknown results on 17Mar2021, he reported that he is waiting for the results to look for antibodies for Myasthenia gravis; chest x-ray was normal on 17Mar2021, he reported that they did a chest x-ray and looked for enlarge thalamus, he states it was normal; endoscopy with results of no finding on Mar2021, his GI doctor wanted to do an upper and lower endoscopy, so 2 weeks prior to the vaccine he had an upper and lower endoscopy with no finding; and ice test with results of bell&#39;s palsy on 16Mar2021 and in his doctor&#39;s opinion, it didn&#39;t look right. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

He said he had some pain at the injection site and mild headache in the afternoon; however, around 12 to 1 am in the morning, he was feeling heart palpitation and he felt his muscle twitching from his upper torso which went down to his thigh and no loss of consciousness.  He said he checked his heart rate and it was 70 and he did not have any problems breathing.  He said his heart palpitation felt better after taking some deep breaths.  He said he no longer had heart palpitations or muscle twitching any more.  He denied any other symptoms.   Generally, he appeared well, no facial drooping, awake, alert, oriented, speech clear, and normal gait. (Today)

A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELO140) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 11Jan2021 at 9:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included Covid-19 from 17Jul2020 to 14Aug2020, he didn&#39;t get hospitalized but was pretty sick. He had circulation issues with it. He had numbing and tingling in his left three fingers (clarified left three fingers as his middle finger, index finger, and ring finger) and numbing and tingling in his toes as well. Concomitant medications included ubidecarenone (COQ-10), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), rosuvastatin and monascus purpureus (RED YEAST RICE). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 52 years old on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. With second dose the patient thought he would be better, but about 12 hours later he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm. He checked his body temperature and he didn&#39;t have a temp. His temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit. He tried to keep himself warm. He got nauseous with it. Basically he looked on line and was having them. Today he started to feel better, but still a little nauseous. He had severe fatigue. He didn&#39;t realize he could go fill out something on the website for CDC. He knew he had wanted the vaccine because he had some severe symptoms when he had COVID. He didn&#39;t want to get COVID again. His hospital frustrates him sometimes. They didn&#39;t put the date on there when he was to come back for the second dose. They didn&#39;t tell him to come back on the 13th. He had to figure the dates from the website and emails. He talked it over with his wife. He came in contact with it every night. He was taking care of people that were critical. He worked in the intensive care unit. Even the people he took care of that didn&#39;t have it, ended up with it. He wore a mask. He used hand sanitizer. He didn&#39;t want to get it again. People were shocked when he got it the first time. He did verify that he got the second dose one day sooner, instead of the three day window. He was sick with the first and was expecting to be more sick with this one. He wanted to give himself an extra day before he had to go back to work. He had a couple of emails where they discussed increasing the window to do it a day sooner. He was going to have to go an hour an half a way to get the second dose and he didn&#39;t want to do that. The patient underwent lab test included height was approximately six two, weight was about 194 lbs on an unspecified date, and body temperature showed 96 degrees Fahrenheit in Jan2021. The outcome of the event he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm, temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit was recovering, for the events he got nauseous with it and he had severe fatigue were not recovered.

History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: None, this was the first dose. No other vaccine administered on the same date. The patient had no events prior vaccination within 4 weeks. In all his life. He had vaccines that received and had no adverse event or side effect whatsoever. He had had the regular flu vaccine early November. The patient experienced feeling anxiousness in the brain, Heaviness in the head, feeling weak in Feb2021, Localized soreness and pain in Jan2021, Goosebumps tingly sensation in head, Blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat is getting higher and higher on 04Feb2021. The patient could not take Benadryl as he cannot tolerate Benadryl. With Zyterc he does not have secondary effects like he does with Benadryl. The first week after getting the vaccine he only had kind of had localized soreness and pain in the area. He later clarified it was in the area where got the injection, vaccine. He just had pain soreness in that area. Other than that he had no side effects at that time. The third week, initially stated as, about 5-7 days ago he started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before. It was like he had the flu kind of thing, but he did not have a temperature. However, the feeling is in his head. It is like heaviness feeling from the flu in his head. He has been having the heaviness in the head feeling for 4-5 days. He later further clarified and initially clarified the localized pain and soreness was noticed the second day, the day after getting the vaccine. This only lasted a few days. He does not remember exactly when this ended. He did not take anything for the localized pain and soreness in the same area as the injection. He confirmed he has recovered completely from this event. Caller further clarified the feeling of anxiousness started Thursday or Friday of last week, maybe 05Feb2021. Stated it was like this feeling is getting worse and worse. Stated it was hard to explain, but he started to feel a goosebumps tingly sensation in his brain in head, in scalp Thursday of last week first. It started with that and slowly over the past few days it has changed and transformed into this heaviness feeling that one would feel from the flu, but he has no fever or anything; it is just in his head. Also, along with that feeling at the same time his blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat was getting higher and higher. His regular blood pressure medications won&#39;t work anymore to bring it down. His blood pressure typically ranges in the 130/85 or less range with all the blood pressure medications he was taking. Once he started having this tingling sensation in his head he had the higher blood pressure and higher heart rate. Now his blood pressure would average being about 170/110 to 180/115. This was like the upper and lower range. His heart rate was typically around 70-75 and now it goes about 80-85. Later during call, he also added, every six months or so his blood pressure may be elevated on these medications. Sometimes his blood pressure was not maintained by the three different blood pressure medications he takes. He was also prescribed two other medications for emergent use Clonidine and Xanax. Usually every six months he would have to take Clonidine and Xanax and typically in an hour to two hours the blood pressure would come down and it&#39;s good. However, this time, he took two Clonidine and Xanax starting last Thursday when had the high blood pressure episode and they were failing to bring the blood pressure down. He further explained it would bring it down for some time, but then it would go back high. The Clonidine is no longer working for the last six days.

He went to see his primary care provider on Monday. On Monday the doctor doubled the dose of Carvedilol. Since then instead of taking 12.5 twice a day, he is now taking 25mg twice a day. On Tuesday, yesterday, he went to get blood work done. Blood was drawn but has no results yet. Localized pain and soreness time of onset didn&#39;t remember, stated he may have had a little pain right after getting the vaccine, but it was around 21:00 25Jan2021 he really noticed the soreness and pain. The following morning around 9 AM it woke him from his sleep and he could feel it more compared to the first day. Anxiousness in the brain around 16:00. The patient had no emergency visit. Stated he almost felt like going when his blood pressure was 182/116 on Saturday night of last week. He was about to go to the ER but decided not to. He ended up taking two Clonidine and one Xanax, laid down, and eventually his blood pressure came down a little. Therefore, he did not go. The patient had physicians office visit. After getting the vaccine he mentioned started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain that was getting worse. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before. Also, his blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat was getting higher and higher. His regular blood pressure medications won&#39;t work anymore to bring it down.

Sometimes his blood pressure was not maintained by the three different blood pressure medications he takes. He was also prescribed two other medications for emergent use Clonidine and Xanax. Clonidine: 0.1mg only during times he has episodes of high blood pressure.

By afternoon of 12 JAN 21 experienced sudden onset loss of bladder control for first time in his life, followed a few hours later by blurry vision, vertigo, motion sickness, emesis and cold sweats that drenched his clothes. Taken to  ER by paramedics, and admitted  for further observation and evaluation for underlying neurologic vs. cardiogenic problems. Given positional treatments by PT for possible otoliths.  Feels much improved on afternoon of 13 JAN 21, but symptoms not fully resolved. Will likely be discharged from hospital on 14 JAN 21 if problems continue to resolve.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination, but did receive the first dose of  BNT162B2, lot number: EJ1685 on 19Dec2020 at 16:15 in the left arm. On 08Jan2021 at 09:00 (reported as onset began 18 hours after injection), the patient experienced 100.2 fever, chills, body aches, extreme fatigue, bedridden 8 hours. It was reported that 30 hours post injection (08Jan2021 at 21:00) he experienced mild weakness and fatigue. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of 100.2 fever, chills, body aches, extreme fatigue, bedridden 8 hours, mild weakness and fatigue was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                The injection site seemed inappropriately high in the shoulder/deltoid.  No aspiration attempted. I had a dripping sweat occur at the five to fifteen minute range. There was a flushing sensation during this. After a few minutes, it all abaited. The bandaid was saturated with blood.  My arm was never sore and I had zero symptoms after the initial reaction. I believe this injection was given intravascularly.  I have not been able to find ANY information to address the effectiveness of this route if administration and I seriously fear that I am not covered.

About 10 minutes later, as I was driving home, I had an odd taste in my mouth and my right cheek started to go numb.  I arrived home and started looking for answers (Pfizer information page that lists side effects).  The sensation lasted about an hour or so, then started to subside.  By the time I went to bed, there was just a little tingle at the edge of my cheek bone. Other than being tired and a bit woozy, I feel better today.

A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 (at the age of 54-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient experienced not feeling well, ate a bit but not much, kind of pale, vomiting, trouble in breathing, and agitated on 04Jan2021; body was hyper dried and restless on 05Jan2021; mind just seemed like it was racing on 06Jan2021; and not responsive and he passed away on 06Jan2021 at 10:15 (reported as: around 10:15 AM). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the vaccine on 04Jan2021, after which he started not feeling well. He went right home and went to bed. He woke up and ate a bit but not much and then was kind of pale. The patient then started to vomit, which continued throughout the night. He was having trouble in breathing. Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting. The patient was told he was probably having a reaction to the vaccine, but he was just dried up. The patient continued to vomit throughout the day and then he was very agitated again and would fall asleep for may be 15-20 minutes. When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening. When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn&#39;t breathe, and his mind was racing. The patient&#39;s other brother went to him and he was not responsive, and he passed away on 06Jan2021 around 10:15 AM. It was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of all of the events was unknown; not responsive was not recovered, the patient died on 06Jan2021. The cause of death was unknown (reported as: not known by reporter). An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and has been requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: not responsive and he passed away

Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

                                                Within approximately a couple of days from the first of two COVID19 Pfizer injections, I developed a progressive, systemic, neuro/neuro-muscular inflammatory pain response.  The inflammation and pain first manifested in my left wrist and hand, greatly worsening recent symptomology that may have been the start of a carpal tunnel syndrome.  The inflammation and pain then progressed to my right wrist and hand and right shoulder.  Then they progressed to my left shoulder, under my clavicles, my hips,  and my upper lumbar/lower thoracic region of my spine.  Muscle groups tightened and hurt, chief among them my hamstrings and upper back.  All within days.  The inflammation and pain were severe, especially from the early a.m. (3 or 4 in the a.m.) to waking hours.  And the conditions left me nearly debilitated and incapable of sleeping well or performing many ADLs.  Then, on Monday, March 29, 2021, I saw an orthopaedic for the pains in my wrists and hands, and he prescribed me a steroid for a preliminary diagnose of bilateral carpal tunnel.  The inflammation and pain throughout my body decreased considerably after only two doses of the steroids.  That led me to seek a consultation with the rheumatologist.

A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Right on 05Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Stargardt&#39;s Disease, Prediabetes, Low Testosterone, Chronic neck pain, and covid-19. Concomitant medication included testosterone (AXIRON). No other vaccine received in four weeks. The patient experienced right sided bell&#39;s palsy on 07Apr2021 06:00. The event resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of right sided bell&#39;s palsy included Prednisone. Outcome of the event was not recovered. No Covid tested post vaccination.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be excluded based on a temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                First episode 01-15-21, started 10am, i was at work, started feeling weak and brain fog so i sat down and another therapist came into the office and told her how i was feeling, they checked my BP 148/92, went to the ER. They took some blood work, CBC panel were  negative, thyroid test, normal, anaiongap, normal, glucose reading, normal and an EKG normal.  2nd episode 01-21-2021 started 11;45am, that morning when i woke up i felt really strong feelings of sadness and despair.  At 11;45a i was about to eat and i started to feel again brain fog, total body weakness, elevated BP, they took my BP again and it was 144/88 so i went to the ER again. I could not keep my eyes open. They did a EKG again with a CTA and a CT with perfusion both were normal. They gave me fluids, sodium fluids. Agian it was transient my BP slowly went down and went home.  Third episode 01-25-2021 started about 9am,  i was at home did not have access to a BP cup, symptoms were same but less intense, i could feel my heart pounding, brain fog and body aches and this lingered throughout the day. It felt like I had the  flu.  No elevated temperature on all three of my episodes.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

The first dose of the vaccine, the pain started the second day and the injection site got swollen. But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

A 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899), via intramuscular route on 17Dec2020 at single dose (dose 1, left deltoid) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included non-smoker. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient was scheduled to take the second dose on 05Jan2021, also reported as 08Jan2021. The patient experienced sore arm for 24 hours afterwards on Dec2020. Patient experienced mild COVID symptoms such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, and tiny bit of shortness of breath on 24Dec2020, but stated he was better now. The patient was positive in the COVID test on 28Dec2020. He wanted to know if it was normal to get COVID after getting the vaccine and if he should get the booster shot if he gets better.  He commented that testing positive for COVID was medically concerning. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow ECMO) or receive a mechanical ventilation. Treatment included over the counter medication. No additional testing was done. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the event sore arm was unknown; cough was not recovered; fever, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, tiny bit of shortness of breath was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number was already obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 virus test positive cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

About 1.5 hours after injection, in between my pull-up exercises I felt light arrhythmia; his legs were shaking which had never happened before; This is a spontaneous report from a  contactable consumer reporting for himself.  A 56-years-old male patient  received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot # EL0140) vaccine , in the right arm on 05Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation .  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced light arrhythmia  on 05Jan2021 16:30 with outcome of recovered , his legs were shaking which had never happened before on 05Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, had sore arm  on 06Jan2021 with outcome of recovered; felt brain fatigue  on 07Jan2021 with outcome of recovered ,  , felt very hungry before dinner  on 07Jan2021 with outcome of recovered , on 07Jan, after breakfast  felt tired, so took a nap  on 07Jan2021 with outcome of recovered , during the whole day i took three naps  on 07Jan2021 with outcome of recovered.   Course of the event: Between 15-30 min after injection, the patient felt light arrhythmia twice and  tried to do deeper breath to control it. About 1.5 hours after injection, in between his pull-up exercises he felt light arrhythmia 2-3 times, and after doing the third set of pull-ups his legs were shaking which had never happened before.  Next morning the patient  woke up a couple hours later than his normal time. Noting that the night before he went to bed one hour earlier for no reason. When semi-waking up, he had a strong arrhythmia, followed by a couple more light ones. In the past arrhythmia did occur to him when he was very stressed or very tired, but had not have it for a few years.  The patient had sore arm but tolerable. On 07Jan2021, after breakfast the patient suddenly felt tired, so took a nap. During the whole day he took three naps, which he had never done before. No arrhythmia though. The patient felt brain fatigue, but physically no problem. He felt very hungry before dinner, same as the day before, but not in other days.

                                                I did not experience any adverse symptoms with the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with the exception of injection site pain after the first dose that began on day 2 through day 5 or for 3 days.  The first Pfizer-BioNTech dose was received on December 30, 2020, LOT EK5730. I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS on 12/31/20.  Please note that I completed the same pretreatment protocol 1.5 hours prior to dosing with Pfizer-BioNTech of Diphenhydramine 25 mg plus Pepcid 20 mg for both COVID-19 doses.  I elected to complete a self-administered pretreatment protocol due to a shellfish allergy and literature reports of anaphylaxis with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in food allergy recipients.  I did not experience any adverse symptoms on Saturday afternoon after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at 4:45pm on 1/23/21.  On Sunday morning 1/24/21, I awoke feeling &#34;cold.&#34;  I dressed warmly, but the feeling progressed to chills by 3pm.  Malaise ensued around 1pm.  I also experienced injection site pain on the morning of 1/24/21 beginning at 7am.  The pain lasted until 1/25/21.  I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS ON 1/24/21.   I began to feel uncomfortable with malaise and chills at 6:15pm on 1/24/21 and self-administered one dose of OTC Aleve, Naproxen sodium 220mg plus one dose of Benadryl 25 mg.  I began to feel better by 9pm on 1/24/21.  I awoke on 1/25/21 without any symptoms or discomfort with the exception of some injection site pain (2 out of 10 on VAS).  I have been asymptomatic since 1/26/21.

The mouth ulcers were treated with oral medication-Valtrex. 2nd dose does not seem to have aggravated the above noted reactions. Other symptoms common to the injection are occurring but seem more intense after the 2nd dose (aches, low energy, some minor coughing)

                                                On  January 8,  I started having a cramping feeling in my right calf. It went on throughout the day without a event.   I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

A 57-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose at the age of 57-years-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 23Feb2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9267, expiry date not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetic, heart patient from 2005 and ongoing, cardiomyopathy from 2005 and ongoing, covid-19 from 14Jan2021 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter reported that her husband (patient) was diagnosed 2 days ago with a vitamin D deficiency and diagnosed at the end of last week with stage 4 chronic kidney disease. The patient just started on his Vitamin D pill until yesterday. He didn&#39;t know he was lacking Vitamin D until the doctor found out. She wants to know if her husband should go ahead and get the second vaccine tomorrow or should he wait a week and let the Vitamin D pill kick in. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s arm started hurting about 5 or 6 hours later after getting the shot on 23Feb2021. The next day, it felt really bad. The patient also had a little bit of fever and body aches on 23Feb2021. The patient had a bunch of labs done and is going back again on 25Mar2021 to have another extensive tests done. It was clarified that it was for the chronic kidney disease and this was also when he found out he had the vitamin D Deficiency. The patient is also getting an ultrasound done on his kidneys to see what is going on. Therapeutic measure were taken as a result of vitamin D deficiency which included treatment with vitamin D pill and for little bit of fever and body aches which included Tylenol PM. The patient did not recover from stage 4 chronic kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency, recovered from arm hurt really bad and little bit of body aches on 25Feb2021, a little bit of fever on 24Feb2021.

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Symptoms started during the evening of 3/30/21 after vaccination.  PCP was contacted on 3/31/21 and we were told the effects would only last 48  hours.  Fever was reduced with Acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h x 2 doses, oral fluids, and icing the axillary.  911 was called on 4/1/21 when pt lost ability to stand and and was minimally vocal but alert.  Pt was hospitalized and remains in that situation at this time.

By Friday, April 2, the patient began experiencing left side numbness and droopiness in his face, had slurred speech and increased blood pressure. Patient thought he was having a stroke, so wife took him to the ER. All lab work and medical tests came back normal. The patient has an appointment with their family doctor on 4/8 and an appointment with a neurologist next month.

He said he said something about his heart rate to a staff member at work, and the staff member tested his heart rate, and told him it was 141. He said he spoke to the nurse at his doctor&#39;s office, and the nurse said the doctor couldn&#39;t do much, and that he could go to emergency room or their practice&#39;s urgent care that is open until 7:00PM.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, on 22Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID 19 immunization. Relevant medical history included COVID infection last Apr2020. On the peak of the COVID pandemic he had the COVID infection, he lost the sense of taste and smell, had diarrhea although he did not have fever and did not have coughing. He also has medical history of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome. He was tested for COVID, he was positive 2 times and then they did PET scan, MRI from head to toe. They were looking for tumor, neuroblastoma, what was causing the shaking, the myoclonus, the opsoclonus, the ataxia, they could not find anything. They gave him convalescent plasma and then they gave him immunoglobulin human normal (IVIG) 5 doses and they gave him high dose of steroid to the point that his blood sugar was reaching sky high they have to give him insulin. He was hospitalized 2 times, 3rd time was 2 days and sent home and then it got worst, so he was readmitted for another &#39;3&#39; days. So, he was sent home on clonazepam, it makes him drowsy and he went for physical therapy and slowly after almost after 8 weeks his symptoms disappear, and he was able to go back to work. His symptoms all recovered by the end of May, towards the beginning of Jun2020 he went back for the swab test, it was negative, COVID PCR negative and my antibody was positive. Concomitant medications included clonazepam, metformin and simvastatin. Patient went back to work and have no symptoms until this 07Jan2020. Like almost 3 week or two and half weeks after he received the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Two and half weeks later he started having symptoms like shaking of the hands that I could barely write and yesterday he could barely walk down the stairs. The patient received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Dec2020. Immediately after the vaccination the patient felt that his hands became weak. He ignored it because it went away, like after a minute or so it went away. He went home and nothing happened, except for the soreness of the arm the injection site for 2 days, which really did not bother him. Then this past Thursday, 07Jan2021, he went to the church, he was lightning a candle and his hands started to shake, he can barely light a candle. He was able to do it although his hands were shaking. So, he went home. He ate breakfast, and called his neurologist and he said just to observe and then it went away. On Saturday night (09Jan2021) he noticed that his hands were shaking again when he was typing in the keyboard. He can manage to type but his hands were shaking. He went to sleep and just ignored it. Then yesterday, Sunday he worked again, it became worse, his handwriting was shaking. He was really holding on to the pen to write legibly and then he was in the third floor hospital, elevators did not work. So, he walked down through the stairs, both of his legs were shaking very bad while he was walking down three slides of stairs but he thought he came to the ground so he was able to walk on the flat floor on the street and able to walk home. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Outcome of the event tremor was unknown, while for the other events was unknown. The consumer considered a causal relationship between the events and the vaccine.

                                                upper bicep pain/soreness around upper part of bicep; tendonitis; lymphadenopathy; sore deltoid; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Healthcare Professional (patient).  This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it&#39;s still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it&#39;s lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can&#39;t think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn&#39;t want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn&#39;t know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node&#39;s reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020. His second dose is scheduled tomorrow (14Jan2021) and wants to know if he can still take it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events myalgia and lymphadenopathy were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tendonitis with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot #: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 at 09:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included a history of anaphylaxis to latex which predated treatment with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, heart rate control, hypertension and high cholesterol; all from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s medical history was &#34;none&#34; and that the patient had no illness at the time of vaccination. Family medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications included ongoing metoprolol taken for heart rate control taken from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for two years&#34;), ongoing telmisartan taken for hypertension orally from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for two years&#34;) at 1x/day (take once daily by mouth) and ongoing rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR; strength: 40mg) taken for high cholesterol from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for 10 years&#34;) at 40mg, 1x/day. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Dec2020 the patient experienced &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34;. It was reported that &#34;a physician called regarding the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he received the second dose of the vaccine on Thursday and was advised by his medical director to call Pfizer to report his symptoms. He reported that he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine three weeks prior to the second dose. The patient first stated that was about 14Dec2020, but then clarified that per his vaccine card, he received the first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at 0900AM in the left arm. The patient stated that he noticed injection site pain that lasted about two days and his arm was pretty sore. Both events completely resolved before the second dose.&#34; It was reported that the events did not require a visit to the physician or to the ER. It was reported that there were no relevant tests. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34; were both recovered/resolved on 15Jan2021.  The reporter considered that there was reasonable possibility (method of assessment: Global introspection) that the events &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34; were related to BNT162B2.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not provided, expiry date May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Jan2021 10:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and apixaban (ELIQUIS, lot number ABA8272S, NDC 0003089421, expiry date Oct2021) film-coated tablet, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to 31Jan2021 at 5 mg, twice daily for cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis. Medical history included: he had tested positive asymptomatically for COVID due to contact contamination on 02Jan2021 or 03Jan2021, blood pressure, and A-fib (atrial fibrillation). Concomitant medication included ongoing metoprolol for blood pressure. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient stated that he got sick after getting the vaccine (on 30Jan2021) and had an important question. He got a fever (31Jan2021) and all that stuff that lasted like a day and a half after getting the vaccine, just like a million other people. But he missed the part about asking a doctor about taking his blood thinner, which he took as normal up through the day that he got the vaccine and the next morning, then he stopped it. The patient clarified that he got the vaccine on Saturday (30Jan2021), stopped the blood thinner on Sunday (31Jan2021), the sickness subsided around Monday (as reported), but he still hasn&#39;t gone back on the blood thinner. He wanted to know when it was safe for him to start taking the blood thinner again, and he needed to know what to do for the second vaccine. The clinical course was as follows: He got the first dose of the vaccine on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 and at 22:00 he started feeling hot through the night. On Sunday, 31Jan2021, he had 103 degree fever, chills, body aches, and a headache. He clarified that he recovered completely by Wednesday, 03Feb2021. He had been on Eliquis for years for A-Fib. He stopped taking it once he got sick after getting the vaccine and went back and read the material and noticed what it said about the blood thinner. He did not go to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. The action taken in response to the events for apixaban was temporarily withdrawn. The outcome of the events was recovered on 03Feb2021.  Follow-up (05Feb2021): This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer based on information received by Pfizer from Bristol-Myers Squibb (manufacturer control number US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-013684), license party for apixaban (ELIQUIS).  This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: #) on 05Feb2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 09Feb2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a patient and describes the occurrence of PYREXIA (103 degree fever), CHILLS, PAIN (bodyaches) and HEADACHE in 58-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) film-coated tablet (batch no. ABA8272S) for Cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included Covid-19 Vaccine injection for COVID-19 immunisation. Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure abnormal. On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (batch no. ABA8272S) (unknown route), 5 milligram twice a day. On 30Jan2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (unknown route) Unknown dose by injection in left arm. On 31Jan2021, an unknown time after starting Eliquis, the patient experienced PYREXIA (103 degree fever), CHILLS, PAIN (bodyaches) and HEADACHE. Eliquis (Unknown) was interrupted due to event. On 03Feb2021, PYREXIA, CHILLS, PAIN and HEADACHE resolved. DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 31Jan2021, Body temperature: 103 degree. For Eliquis (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

At 1720 I was at home and started itch all over my, arms legs, and stomach. Broke out in a rash on my stomach and chest. At 1830 my tongue was swelling and had a hard time speaking. I call a friend and told her. She told me to take some Benadryl. I did. I then went to bed. My friend came over at about 2100 because she was worried and found me in bed. My breathing was off and she tried to wake me. She called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.  I am now in rehab with undetermined results as to what happened.

                                                I woke at 6:30am on 04/07/2021 in a state of complete confusion and disorientation.  It was a level of disorientation I have never experienced before in my lifetime.  I fainted one time and was having extreme difficulty getting my bearings and walking and was simply in total &#34;mental disarray&#34;.  I was having difficulty producing words, a prolonged stutter, you might say.  I was shaking.  The local paramedics came and I was taken to the local ER.  Because I was having difficulty speaking, the paramedics (and later the physicians) thought I might have had a TIA.  An MRI on 04/07/2021 at 5pm produced a negative result.  So i can only attribute my reaction to the vaccine.  It was very significant, and i thought it made sense to report it.

A 58-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8734) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:00 at age of 58-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It also stated the patient was one of the most vulnerable against virus so he took the Covid-19 Vaccine. Medical history included ongoing cardiac failure congestive diagnosed probably 10 years ago, ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed probably 20 years ago, ongoing dialysis for 3.5 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing unspecified blood thinner. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t take any blood pressure medications and that she knew the patient took a blood thinner. Caller unable to provide further detail for the patient&#39;s medications as she doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s list of medications with her. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534) injected in left arm in Mar2021 at age of 58-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fatigue after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it was hard to determine the cause of the fatigue because the patient was on dialysis, but that the patient has been more fatigued since he received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was a compromised fellow with a host of pre-existing conditions as far as heart disease, diabetes, and dialysis. Caller was calling in regard to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she was calling to report a bad reaction that her husband, the patient, received on Sunday, 04Apr2021, following his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Approximately 3 hours after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient had a full blown seizure at 15:00 on Sunday, 04Apr2021. Caller reported that she had to call emergency responders following the patient&#39;s seizure. The patient was doing better but the experience with his seizure was quite traumatic. Caller stated that if it was going to happen, it was going to happen to us. About 3 hours after receiving his Covid-19 vaccine on 04Apr2021, the patient became real sluggish and his speech started getting slow before the seizure occurred. Caller reported that the patient made a gradual descent downwards. Caller reported that she swears the patient has not been the same as far as fatigue goes since the patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior. Caller reported that she thought the fatigue was maybe from dialysis. The patient started to get slow just before the seizure, about 2.5 hours after he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was laying down following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s breathing was off. The patient&#39;s breath was heavier. Caller reported that after she noticed the patient&#39;s breathing was off, she asked the patient if he was ok. Caller reported that this is when she noticed that the patient&#39;s speech was really slow and that he was experiencing confusion. The patient has had no more seizure activity. The patient was still being monitored in the hospital. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t remember any of it. It&#39;s hard to say if the patient&#39;s sluggishness and fatigue were ongoing. Caller reported that she couldn&#39;t go see the patient while he was in the hospital but that the patient&#39;s voice sounds much stronger. For Confusion and Speech: Caller reported that the patient seems to be back/ returned to normal. Caller reported that she knew that the patient&#39;s cardiologist went to see the patient. The patient&#39;s cardiologist said that there was nothing that happened to the patient&#39;s heart, that what the patient experienced was not a heart issue, and that the event had no effect on the patient&#39;s heart. The medical staff stated that the seizure the patient experienced was related to a blood pressure drop. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low on 04Apr2021. The patient required a visit to Emergency Room for event seizure, no visit of physician office. Admitted on Sunday, 04Apr2021 for seizure, and still hospitalized. For investigations: Caller reported that the medical staff at the hospital definitely did lab work but she was not sure if any imaging was performed. Caller reported that she has no results available for tests that were performed. The outcome of events confusion and &#34;speech started to get slow&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021380129 same patient, different product(dose)/event

It resolved in two hours. He did have soreness for two days after the vaccine.  He did not have any other symptoms like rashes or difficulty breathing. He could lift his arm.  It made him a little nervous. It was bad enough that he pulled over from the freeway and rested for a few  hours.  He used an ice pack that helped the soreness, but this was after then numnbness resolved.

                                                Had my 2nd COVID vaccination shot at 2 pm on Monday, January 11, 2021.    Next morning - moderate pain in upper left arm/shoulder (place of injection). Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.

On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January.

I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.

Pt was recently transitioned from haldol decanoate to clozapine.  Last dose haldol decanoate was on 2/16/21. First dose clozapine 12.5 mg was on 2/24/21. Increased to 12.5 BID the following day. Increased to 25 mg BID on March 2, without reported side effects or other issues.  Pt got his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on March 4, and that night was less engaged with staff, felt feverish. Did not spike a temp per bedside accompaniment who was with him that day. The following day, he barely ate any food and did not get out of bed all day. This continued for the entirety of the weekend - bed bound, turning to look at staff when called but did not engage/respond verbally. He was incontinent of urine over the weekend.

A 59-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EN6207, Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (at the age of 59 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lupus from 2020 and ongoing, ongoing High Blood Pressure, Spinal Surgeries from 1999, Chronic Pain,Retention water, blood clot issue. The patient previously had tetanus shot. Concomitant medications included losartan potassium; allopurinol; hydroxychloroquine; methocarbamol; morphine sulfate (MS CONTIN); oxycodone; furosemide.  Caller states he is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. Seven days later the dose of vaccine (18Mar2021), patient developed Bell&#39;s Palsy which he has never had before and has never had any other problem with. He has seen an ENT, his pain doctor, and his medical doctor and they all say the Covid vaccine has caused the problem he is having. He was told by his ENT this is very possibly permanent. Emergency Doctors are who he went to because he thought he was having a stroke, because half of his face went numb. He has been to the doctor 10 times in the last 7 days, it has not been fun at all. He didn&#39;t put it together until he saw the ENT, who said Bell&#39;s Palsy is caused from a virus. States he had no idea until he said that, that it could possibly be from the injection. States he has never had Bells Palsy before and it started 8 days after the initial shot. His right eyelid was sticking on his eye and wouldn&#39;t shut and he couldn&#39;t move his face on the left side and he can&#39;t control it at all. Clarifies he couldn&#39;t shut his right eye all of the way. Since then they have told him he needs to tape his eye shut for 12 hours a day to keep from going blind. The thing that bothers him is his eye sight in that eye is getting worse every day even though he uses the cream and tapes it shut. His wife told him even with both eyes shut, it will not completely shut because his lower eyelid is hanging down too far. The ENT told him he needs a hearing test today at 2:00p.m. to see if this is going to be a permanent problem. He is getting ready to go to the ear doctor to find out more. At the same time he developed the Bells Palsy, his blood got really thin and wouldn&#39;t clot which seems really weird. Also on 18MAR2021, his left hand got really swollen and the entire arm bruised and they said the edema in his hand got to the point where his skin was cracking because his blood got so thin that it couldn&#39;t clot at all. He had a blood clot issue in the past. States his arm and hand have improved, he can move his hand again finally. The ENT said that since he has been on Prednisone, for recovery for Bells Palsy, for over a week and gotten worse instead of better, it may be permanent. Prednisone is not working, it has actually gotten worse. Prednisone 10mg for 7 days and to decrease by one tablet every day until gone but states he has gotten worse. Treatments (assessed as for all events): Prednisone. States that it has been two weeks since this happened and the doctor told him the only other option is skull surgery. The bones in his head would be drilled out to make room for the nerves in hopes he would be able to work his mouth again, so not a good thing. Eye cream. He is on disability and his house payment is 3/4 of what he makes, so he can&#39;t take care of the medical bills himself otherwise he wouldn&#39;t worry about it. It is very depressing. His medical doctor said he hadn&#39;t seen any cases of Bell&#39;s Palsy for 2 years, and he has seen 4 in the last week so that doesn&#39;t give him a lot of confidence even though he is still encouraging people to get the vaccine because it is safer than not.He has multiple visits to the ER 3 times between 18MAR2021 and 19MAR2021 within 24 hours; states he was in the ER for hours and hours but no admission. States they did a CT Scan, MRI, CT with contrast and then after that ended up 22 saw ENT who confirmed the fact that Covid Vaccine that gave Bells Palsy and on 22-23 saw his GM again. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None within 4 weeks; states 9 months ago he had a Tetanus Shot. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy, Visual acuity decreased, Eyelid disorder, Orofacial dyskinesia, numbness in face was not recovered; other events was recovering. All events happened on 18Mar2021.
