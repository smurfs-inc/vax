Maybe it is one of the reasons.  He did not have a fever, but he sweated a lot.  He felt like his shirt was wet in the morning. He also had sore throat and lost his sense of smell on 06:00 31Dec2020. It is weird. He never had that before.  He doesn&#39;t know what the do. If it was normal or it was symptoms of COVID. Second one will be on 12Jan2020. Should he get tested for COVID. Wanted to know if he should get the second dose. The outcome of events, fever, chill, felt cold, sweating a lot was recovering. The outcome of sore throat and cannot smell anything was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.

There were no symptoms of this right before the vaccine.

                                                Guillain Barre syndrome/Symptoms started with 2 fingers tingling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting for a patient. A 40-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EK4176), via intramuscular on 09Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EJ1685), via intramuscular on 22Dec2020 at single dose in left arm at the age of 39-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. Reported he was diagnosed with Guillain Barre syndrome. Symptoms started with 2 fingers tingling on 11Jan2021. Progressively increasing in severity. Now had numb fingers and toes. Initiating IV therapy on 22Jan2021. The adverse event result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Pt is coming in after about 35 minutes ago he had some extreme flushing he describes it as &#34;feeling like he put his head in an oven and some skin itchiness on his arms. He notes he started taking niacin today. He also got his second dose of his Covid vaccine last night. He has no throat swelling or difficult breathing. He has not had any nausea or vomiting. He denies any recent fevers or chills. He did switch his asthma medications to Trelegy last week. He otherwise has no other allergies. The patient had just started taking Niacin which is more likely the etiology of the case in question and symptoms rather than the vaccine-pfizer. Most likely this was related to the niacin and not the pfizer vaccine.

                                                I have a history of neuropathy that has been dormant most of the last year. I went in with no nueropathy occuring to get my vaccines. After the 1st Pfizer shot I had neuropathy starting the day after that went away in about  a week. After the 2nd about 3 days later it started with itching all over my body (neuropathic itch), and burning mostly in my feet, but random electrical shocks throughout my body 24/7 (while awake). It has not subsided and has actually gotten worse. There are at least a dozen people on the clinic message board saying the same thing happened to them, that the vaccine awakened or made worse their neuropathy exponentially. Here is the link to similar complaints.

                                                Within 8-10 minutes I had a wave of heat start from the back of my head to the front, like the feeling you get right before you go under from anesthesia. My heart began to race and I was lightheaded. I reported the reaction and was given an oximeter to check oxygen and heart rate. Heart rate was 140, oxygen 99. BP was also checked and was normal. Was given water and sat for another 10 minutes. Felt better and heart rate was under 100 until another wave of lightheadedness came over me and heart rate spiked again to over 120. It came down again. A few minutes later lightheadedness came back, shaking started, and heart rate spiked again. It lasted about 10 minutes. After 55 minutes of staying at facility I was able to leave. However, did have one more brief episode of lightheadedness and heart rate spiking. Sore arm and extreme ringing in one ear were only side effect the  following day.

Once he received the vaccine, he became nauseous, sweaty, clammy, dizzy and lightheaded. Pt explained to immunizer that he was switched to night shift and had taken his diabetic meds without food soon before his shift at 5:30pm. An EMT was on scene and she proceeded to call more medics. I checked on the pt and he was vomiting and very pale. Medics checked pt vitals and okayed him for work.

The pain increased if I moved my arm greater than perpendicular to my body. The worst pain though with with my back. I could not stand up straight without a sharp pain starting in my lower back. I was also extremely tired. So I called into work took some Tylenol and went back to bed. By 1 o?clock that afternoon I had felt fine as if nothing had ever happened.

The focusing/concentration issues went away by the next morning when I woke up, however I have been feeling very tired physically since then. I&#39;m yawning all day and have very little energy or interest in doing things I need to be doing.  I&#39;m not certain that this is vaccine related, and I&#39;m not super concerned about it yet as I&#39;m on Spring break from school, but I start virtual classes again on Monday and will be concerned if I&#39;m still super tired. If it doesn&#39;t go away by next weekend, I will likely resubmit/add on to this report if that is an option.  It is not a serious concern yet so I haven&#39;t contacted medical professionals yet, but I thought it might be a good idea to at least report that this has been going on to VAERS

                                                Patient had a seizure/convulsion immediately after the vaccination. I did not personally see them have the convulsion, but his wife observed this. By the time I had made it to the vehicle he had come to and was fine. Patient was also extremely anxious about receiving the vaccination. We believe his anxiety may have manifested as a seizure/convulsion in some way. No other issues or allergic reactions.

                                                Starting at 8pm on vaccination day I got loopy and disoriented, and had a hard time speaking intelligibly.  I also had trouble with balance and fine motor skills.  Had some personality changes too: became very moody with erratic mood swings. The next day I slept all day because of exhaustion and aches. When I woke up on Wednesday (36hrs later) I was literally screaming in pain because of how bad my arm and shoulder hurt. It hurt to move it, and hurt not to move it.  It was excruciating and ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help at all. Throughout Wednesday I could hardly move my left arm. Getting dressed or washing my hair was very difficult and very painful.  I was also still very uncoordinated. My left armpits lymph nodes were so swollen that (1) it filled in my entire armpit so there was no more pit, just a very soft bulge, and (2) the fluid extended all the way to my chest and it looked like I had one breast and one pec.

                                                I was surprised that I am having any side effects due to the fact that I am so very lucky in that department, in most cases. The first day, following the shot, I had a bit of soreness at the injection site but it was gone by the following day, Friday, 3/26/21. I had a general feeling of weakness the afternoon and into the night on the day of the shot as well. However, it was about midday or a bit after the following day that I began feeling obvious side effects. These include, primarily, a general feeling of being ill. Headache (but that&#39;s not that abnormal &amp; body aches and stiffness similar to a mild version of influenza. It appeared late in the day on Saturday, 3/27/21 and has continued since.

A 40-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, brand: Pfizer), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 24Mar2021 11:30 at age of 40-year-old (Lot Number: ER8733) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Facility of Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. Medical history included gout, anxiety, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, &#39;espoghutis&#39;. The patient did not have allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication within 2 weeks of vaccination included omeprazole; allopurinol; escitalopram. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 10Mar2021 11:30 at age of 40-year-old (Lot Number: En6206) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 02Apr2021, the patient had vivid/lucid dreaming with bright lights and unusual feelings as he initially fell asleep. He was able to wake himself up but remained in between sleep and awake. This was accompanied by light headiness a feeling that he would pass out or die and tingling and shaking throughout his body as he remained in a confused mental state while his wife called an ambulance. In 2021, his vitals were fine with occasionally elevated blood pressure and slight markings of dehydration ( during the day following his second dose he felt like he had a bad hangover). The ER doctor thought the most likely explanation is sometime of nocturnal panic attack with unknown trigger. He had not previously sufferer anything like it. The events were reported as non-serious. The adverse events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the adverse events which included: drugs to calm, fluids. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events light headiness, tingling and shaking throughout his body, confused mental state, nocturnal panic attack with unknown trigger, vivid/lucid dreaming with bright lights, elevated blood pressure, slight markings of dehydration, hangover were resolving.   Information on lot/batch number obtained. Further information is expected.

Discussed with another healthcare provider Discussed case with another healthcare provider ? Consultation Consultation 1, Consultation 2 ? Consultation 1 04/16/2021 15:54 ? Consultation 1 Comments discussed with  RPh.  He will come to ER to obtain additional information from patient.  This is the hospital&#39;s first presumptive Pfizer vaccine reaction. ? Consultation 2 04/16/2021 15:41 ? Consultation 2 Comments discussed with Dr.  we discuss presentation.  he agrees pt will need monitoring with the persisting symptom/findings and the H/O COPD.  1617 Dr has been to ER and completed eval.  pt to be placed on 2nd floor med/tele for additional monitoring and treatment.  pt did have labs yesterday.    ? Decision to Admit Based On  1446 Based on his symptoms and presentation presumptive acute anaphylaxis to component of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  We will begin treatment with 0.3 mg epinephrine IM once as well as dexamethasone, famotidine, diphenhydramine IV. We will continue to monitor with cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  He does have slight wheezing but this may be related to his chronic COPD.  No respiratory distress at this time, but his symptoms seem to have been mildly progressive over the past hour (per his report).  I believe inclusion of the epi to be prudent based on his presentation. Additionally, I will inform the vaccination clinic of this reaction.  he agrees pt will benefit from continued monitoring and repeated IV antihistamine and IV steroid treatment.  Pt will need IVFluid for hydration as well.   Recheck: ? Recheck Recheck 1, Recheck 2, Recheck 3 ? Time 14:55 ? Recheck patient stable  patient improving with treatment ? Comments He is improving.  His skin is now warm and moist (not sweatty , not diaphoretic).  The rash is receeding from the arms. Good coloration to the legs/ankles.  Back &amp; torso rash starting to recede.  no nausea/vomiting. no difficulty breathing. still with fading macular rash on the torso and upper back. Lungs: improved air movement compared to the initial exam, nl effort, no rales, crackles, rhonchi.  He has lower field (only) quiet fine inspiratory wheezes.  Normal resonance on percussion.  Cough mildly wheeze @ bases, with improved airflow. Cardiac: borderline tachy RRR S1, S2, without murmur or rub.  Posterior tibial, pedal pulses 2/4 bilaterally.  No ankle or pretibial edema. ?

Patient rash has faded from his extremities fully and appears to have faded from his abdomen still somewhat at the malar area of the cheeks as well as the neck and torso portion of the chest.  His pulse is 98?99 continues to have elevated blood pressure.  Pulse oximetry 98-100% on room air, normal.  Pharmacist will enter the reaction into the CDC/FDA/Pfizer database. Overall pt notes he feels tired (probably related to hydration &amp; benadryl).  He notes he has returned to home about 2 weeks ago after spending some time on the road in mountains playing guitar / touring with a small band , playing music. ? Time #3 15:37 ? Recheck #3 patient stable ? Comments #3 He has been resting.  No respiratory distress.  His blood pressure and pulse and pulse oximetry are reviewed at bedside and they are nonfocal at this time.  Overall he is improving.  He notes he still has malaise and feels about the same with itching in his back and the sensation in his throat.  When I evaluate his back there is hyperemia/some macular rash that is in approximately the distribution of the trapezius muscle of the back this is where he notes he has the itching.  Additionally when I evaluate his throat there is still some presence of uvula edema.  There is no other angioedema.  Perhaps he does have some mild hyperemia to the uvula and soft palate at this time.  He is clinically improving but his symptoms have not resolved fully.  Skin warm and dry normal turgor.

So, it was between his armpit his heart where he felt the bubble; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (parent). A 40-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 (at the age of 40-year-old) as single dose indicated to prevent from Corona virus (Covid-19 Immunization). Medical history included seizures and gout. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included unspecified medication for seizures. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: ER8730) on 24Mar2021 for Covid-19 Immunization. The patient got the second Pfizer shot later this month, left the office, 45 minutes later (on 14Apr2021) he had seizures and ended up in emergency room. He has had small seizures but they are not back to back, of and on throughout the years and now we are saying that maybe COVID Vaccine shot is what provoked him to, what made him had seizures. Reporter stated, even though he has had seizures in the past like it could be 2, 3 years apart for one. But the shot it caused him to have another seizure, but he is not going to continue to have seizures, as he is on medication (unspecified medication) right now. But the medication is on, if they take him off it, he could have multiple seizures constantly (name of medication not clarified further). Also on 14Apr2021, the patient also had a scar in left arm, it is another symptom he had. He had the scar in his left arm before he had a seizure, he said over here between his heart and his arm felt like a (incomplete sentence), now they don&#39;t know if he had a one scar or what it says but he says that &#39;he could feel a bump, it was like a bump in there. So, it was between his armpit his heart where he felt the bubble&#39; (not clarified further).  The patient underwent laboratory test which included: blood work, a urine sample and they did a CAT scan to see knowing the problem in his brain, all on 14Apr2021 with unknown result. The day of the test was on the 14th, it would have been on a Wednesday. It was the same day that he got the second shot. So, he had these test done on 14Apr (14Apr2021). Reporter confirmed of getting the test results on Thursday, so did not have the details. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of seizures which included Levetiracetam 500 mg tablet, he takes one tablet twice a day, so he takes two tablets a day. This was ordered by his doctor in emergency room. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                The day after had myalgias and fatigue and arm pain.  But on 1/10/21 began developing mild 2/10 headaches.  On 1/11/21 the headache  worsened to 4/10 and was associated with myalgias and neck stiffness.  After a jog, I was in the shower and noticed a rash all over my body that had been pruritic.  I went to the ER that night where I tested negative for flu A/B and also tested negative for covid (Antigen then PCR).  Got a CMP, CBC, and coags to rule out ITP.  everything was normal.  The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

                                                Belly&#39;s palsy, right side of face; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported for a 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included anxiety, cervical myofascial pain syndrome, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), known allergies: eggs, detergent. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), esomeprazole (NEXIUM), prochlorperazine (COMPAZINE) and experienced allergies. The patient experienced Belly&#39;s palsy, right side of face on 25Jan2021. The adverse event resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment received for the adverse event included prednisone and valaciclovir (VALACYCLOVIR). Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations, the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported Belly&#39;s palsy, right side of face and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2.

                                                Patient screened for first dose of Pfizer vaccine. He checked no history of allergies or reactions to medications or vaccines. In the initial screening he informed me he had a phobia of needles but this is usually with blood draws. He reported he should be fine with vaccinations. I inquired on previous reactions and he denied any allergic reaction just that he does not like them. I asked him how I can help give the vaccine. We had him look away and to think of a different situation. I asked him if he would like to know when I am administering or just use distraction. He chose to be informed when he would feel a slight poke. Vaccine was administered with no issues.  Within the minute following the vaccine patient started to feel dizzy. Hung his head a bit but was responsive. I requested staff assistance to help the situation including RN to prevent any episodes of syncope.  We provided water which he was able to drink. He was still seated and we suggested putting head between legs. This was not comfortable for him so we moved him to the floor. About 3-4 min in he began to sweat a bit more and appeared Pale. We obtained a BP and pulse. BP was 112/60 and pulse around 60.  When he felt hot, sweaty and appeared pale we all decided to call EMS to be cautious. He maintained BP, no SOB, did not lose conscious. EMS evaluated him, med list provided and vitals. He was on medications for anxiety.  They released him after about 30min and reported a panic attack and not related to the vaccine.  Patient walked out of the clinic with his partner and was stable. He is requesting 2nd dose of the vaccine. I informed him nurse would review and would have a plan for future injection.

These all occurred about 12 hours after the second shot and subsided around 36 hours after the second shot.  8.5 days after the second shot I had throat and chest pain.  This pain then continued and got worse to the point I went to the ER and was evaluated for potential heart attack.  After testing - results were that I did not have a heart attack.  I was still experiencing this pain, so the ER took a strep test.  This was also negative.  The diagnosis was &#34;pulled chest muscle&#34;.  I&#39;ve had pulled muscles, I know what those feel like and it sure didn&#39;t feel like what I experienced on the night of the 16th and the day of the 17th of Feb. 2021.

                                                For the first 24 hours I had no symptoms other than arm pain. For the next 6 days experienced debilitating headaches, which led to nausea (because they were so severe). Elevated blood pressure also coupled with headaches.  I initially took Ibuprofen (which helped somewhat), whereas Tylenol did nothing. I also have a flexible ice pack that I placed over my head. That also helped a little. I went to the doctor on March 17th, but he was dismissive of the headaches being related to the vaccine. I have since been referred to  a neurologist (April 1st appointment).

                                                The patient is a 41 yo male with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis who experienced DVT and PE temporally related to Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine dose #2 receipt.  He is a Service Member and reported  high levels of baseline activity, including running 10 miles each Saturday. He received vaccine #1 25 JAN 21 (EN5318) without AE. He received dose #2 on 16 FEB 21, (EN6200). He experienced no immediate symptoms suggestive of IgE event. On day 1 he reports feeling cold, mild fatigue but no other symptoms. On day 2 he was baseline. On day 3 he noted numbness, tightness  and discomfort to his right  calf. On day 4 (Saturday), his usual long run day, he experienced dyspnea and lightheadedness after running 20-30 feet. He states he noted tightness in his calf and instead walked the track while his wife completed her run. He rested day 5.  Day 6 he noted significant edema to his calf, which he describes as double normal in size, and iced it. Day 7, he tried to schedule with PCP and based on triage was sent to ER. ER diagnosed R DVT and bilateral PE&#39;s. He was admitted overnight, started anticoagulation therapy. He saw hematology, and the workup was negative for other causes.

But as I walked out to my car I quickly got heavy and tired and started to ache and have a headache. I had to rest in my car for a while before driving home. Once home I crashed immediately for around 4 hours in the middle of the day which is not like me. I had an important dinner meeting i had to attend for my livelihood. I thought I was feeling better but half way through Dinner  I started feeling bad again. Got to the point that I stopped eating and excused myself to get home and rest. Symptoms progressed rapidly. Unfortunately I was pulled over for a minor traffic stop and  tried to explain that I was having a bad reaction to the vaccine and needed to get home. They wouldn?t believe me  and torturously treated me like an OVI. I?m hoping that I can get some kind of documentation and or assistance. I have court on the 1st and it will be devastating if I am convicted. I was not intoxicated  and was not warned about the dangers of driving after the vaccine. Please call me. I need help

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included drug hypersensitivity from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Allergic to sulfa, PCN and amoxicillin. The patients concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date the patient experienced sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, was pulled over for minor traffic violation. He was told to get out of the car and had a field sobriety test, and I looked intoxicated, felt heavy and tired/run down, had a headache, bad diarrhea, upset stomach, sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, crashed for 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day which I never do, aching, overall weakness, started feeling sick again at dinner, he went to the bathroom a few times, woke up feeling really bad. The patient was worried because everything was coming to a head right now. The caller got the first shot, he waited for 15 minutes and felt fine. As the caller walked to his car he began feeling heavy, had severe diarrhea, headache, aching, it was almost like he passed out, it felt like he went to sleep. The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner. The caller got pulled over for a minor traffic stop, cutting the corner and crossing the line or something small. The officers believed the caller was driving under the influence and started making him do a sobriety test with 40 degree wind gusts, the patient was miserable. The caller told the officers that he needed to seek medical attention but they ignored him. The officers forced the caller to do the urine test. It has been 5 days since his vaccination and he is just now feeling better. The outcome of events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed.  No further information is expected.

I slept all day until almost 1500. When I woke up my fever was gone. I&#39;m left tonight feeling hungry again along with some residual sore muscles and aches.  The fever responded well to Ibuprofen. I hydrated with water and Gatorade.  It pretty much felt like influenza for just under 48 hours. I feel like I&#39;m past the worst of it now, but I&#39;m not fully recovered.

                                                On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was &#34;borderline&#34; according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for &#34;exploratory surgery&#34; with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn&#39;t stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn&#39;t even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.

Hypothermia.  Couldn&#39;t get warm.  It&#39;s like my body forgot  how to regulate temperature. I&#39;ve only ever experienced similar coming out of anesthesia after surgery.  Took wearing multiple layers of clothes AND multiple blankets just to stabilize my body temp.  It lasted for around 2-3 hours.  This wasn&#39;t normal &#34;chills&#34;.  This was whole-body shaking hypothermia.  Entire body sore afterwards from the involuntary shaking.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get an actual reading as anything to measure body temp was downstairs and I didn&#39;t want to risk falling.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

I got x-rays and started doing physical therapy. I took Tylenol for pain. Started improving - I&#39;m probably about 40% better. I received the second dose on January 20th -  just had a slightly sore arm.

                                                shingles; rash; shoulder pain; little nerve pain thing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 42-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: from vaccine card: EL then either 0 or O 142), via an unspecified route of administration by injection once to left arm on 13Jan2021 at single dose for prevention (covid-19 immunisation).  Medical history was none.  There were no concomitant medications. Patient was diagnosed with shingles about 3 weeks after receiving his first injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. This male consumer received his first injection of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021. He reported being diagnosed with shingles last Thursday (04Feb2021) and stated his symptoms started that same week (Feb2021), which were described as rash and shoulder pain. He reported his shingles are improved and are scabbing over. The consumer was prescribed and was taking valacyclovir for treatment of the shingles. Shingles was now (base on 09Feb2021) healing. Shingles occurred after the first dose, he was not blaming the vaccine, he did fine, he had no reaction, his first dose was on 13Jan2021, and shingles came up last week (on 04Feb2021). The consumer&#39;s second dose of the covid-19 vaccine was supposed to be last week (base on 09Feb2021) but this physician recommended he delay due to the shingles. Currently on an antiviral, getting better, feels great, wondering if he can proceed with second dosage. The consumer was wanting to get his second dose this week (base on 09Feb2021). No investigation Assessment. Outcome: he scabbed up, he never had fever, just a rash and the little nerve pain thing (Feb2021), that&#39;s it. Stated he had no reaction to the vaccine whatsoever. The outcome of shingles was recovering, of other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

A 42-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Lot #: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 (at the age of 42-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not have any known allergies. The patient did not receive any other medications within two weeks prior to the vaccination and did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 30Jan2021 the patient experienced swelling, red spots and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;two weeks after my COVID-19 vaccination I noticed swelling, red spots, and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it. I visited my podiatrist who recommended NSAIDs for a week. Today, my sister in law who is a nurse said it looked like COVID toes. When I googled an image of COVID toes, the spots looked identical to my own.&#34; The adverse events required a physician office visit. The patient received treatment for the events which included NSAIDs. The clinical outcomes of the events swelling, red spots and tenderness on my right big toe and the toe next to it were all not recovered/not resolved. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Patient looked very pale, perhaps had some minor foam at the mouth and was extremely hot. We stayed by patient, protected his head, allowed him to come to, took coat off and applied ice packs, took BP/pulse (normal) and patient was oriented x3. EMS arrived and took over.

Body was shaking and didn?t have a fever. Skin felt like it was burning whole body felt swollen. Started around 2:30am with the cramping. It woke me up. Once I got up everything came so fast. Was rushed to hospital where I was admitted very quickly. I was blacking out on the drive there and blacked out while in their care. This was from one dose of Pfizer vaccine for Covid. I was put on a GI, Allergy, and steroid medications. I was hooked up to an IV and 3 drugs were injected. I passed out numerous times but was discharged at 5am.

When I went to see that patient, he was laying on the floor with his eyes rolled in the back of his head and was unresponsive. He was not alert. He started having a mild seizure and I rolled him over on his left side. While I was bracing the patient, pharmacist came in and administered an Epi-pen to his left thigh. Patient stopped seizing so I rolled him back on his back. He became alert and was able to provide me his name, DOB and what he was at the pharmacy for. I rested my hand under his head and monitored his pulse until the paramedics arrived

He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

                                                Woke up in the morning with soreness in wrist and elbow and practically zero use of my left hand.  Woke up on left side so just assumed hand was asleep.  After 15 minutes of no improvement,  I started to panic thinking I was having a stroke.   Realizing I had no other symptoms and was feeling fine otherwise I knew that likely wasn&#39;t the case. Besides having zero strength (I did have feeling) my hand would curl inward toward my body.  I could manipulate with my right hand by it would always curl back in. I was barely able to grip, would actually have to manipulate my fingers into a grasp, couldn&#39;t do it on it&#39;s own, and holding something as light as my cellphone would cause my hand to turn down towards the floor. Pain level I would only describe as soreness in my wrist and elbow.  Annoying but not painful. It&#39;s now over 24 hours since symptoms first appeared and besides some slight weakness in the hand I would say I&#39;m 95% better.

                                                myositis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 43-year-old male patient received  first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown) on an unspecified date in Dec2020 reported as around the end of December,  at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date after he received the vaccine he had right arm pain and swelling (states it was in his bicep brachial radialis in the muscle) which is the opposite arm of the injection site. He had an MRI done on an unknown date that showed myositis. He thinks could be due to the vaccine since it started two days after he received the vaccine. His pain peaked at about a week and a half and now the pain was improving and the swelling was down. He still had function in the right arm but when he strained it would hurt. His concern was that the reaction may be an autoimmune reaction and the first response was muted. He was worried the second dose may elicit a larger response. At the time of the reporting the patient was recovering from the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between the myositis and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. Additional information regarding onset latency, relevant medical history, concomitant medications and detailed clinical course around the event onset will aid in comprehensive assessment of the case. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                heart is racing; face felt hot; irregular heartbeat; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 43-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left shoulder on 06Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 protection. Medical history included with irregular heartbeat (diagnosed years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated that his heart was racing. He was sleeping and woke up to heart racing 130-140. He had irregular heartbeat and his face felt hot the morning of 07Jan2021. He did not know if it was his heart, nerves or what. was his first dose. He got the vaccine on his job and stated that sometimes his heartrate goes up and down not to this magnitude and not while sleeping. He had asked one of the nurses during vaccination about having irregular heartbeat and taking the vaccine and was told that one could die of much worst than this. Patient wanted to know if he should go to the doctor and what to do. Outcome of the event heart racing was recovering while for face felt hot was recovered on the same day of 07Jan2021, and for the remaining event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

After several hours of sleep I got out of bed around 0600 and noticed severe body and joint ache and a headache. Once I began moving around I also noticed I would fatigue very quickly. Reminded me of how one feels when they get a good case of the Flu. As the day progressed all symptoms lessened in severity and I went to bed at about 20% of what I felt that morning. I woke the following morning and felt no residual symptoms.

                                                coughing quite a bit; seizure; his whole body feels sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 43-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3248) in right deltoid, on 11Jan2021 around 10:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was in high risk group, was living in senior facility and was disabled. Medical history included also ongoing hydrocephalus diagnosed when he was less than a year old, ongoing shunt (the first one when he was 11 months old, has had multiple revisions since then, the last in 2017), vagal nerve stimulator implantation ongoing from 2003 (for epilepsy; has had multiple since then, last one in 2015), ongoing hemiparesis since he was a baby and epilepsy (he was taking epilepsy drugs but it was well controlled). Concomitant medications included oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) ongoing from 2000, at 1800 mg daily (600 mg in the morning and 1200 mg at night), for epilepsy and levetiracetam (KEPPRA XR) ongoing from 2000, at 1500 mg twice daily (in the morning and at night), for epilepsy. He was on prior medications to these, since he was young. Over the years he has changed to newer and better medications. On 11Jan2021 around 8-9 PM the patient experienced seizure. The patient has not had a grand mal seizure in over 5 years. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, after the vaccine, his whole body felt sore. He was unsure if it was from the seizure or the vaccine. The reporter also noticed that the patient had been coughing quite a bit on 12Jan2021 morning. Events outcomes were unknown.

                                                I had some sort of reaction.  I was glad to get the shot and was not nervous about getting the shot. 5 minutes after the shot I felt something cold go down my left arm from my shoulder to my hand.  A minute or two after that both my hands went numb, then both my arms went numb.  I asked others around me if anyone felt anything and everyone else was fine.  A minute or two after that both my legs went numb. I started to black out but made it to a chair before this happened,  I drank some cold water and felt awake about 5 minutes later.  30 minutes after that i felt comfortable enough to walk.  For the rest of the day i felt like i was legally drunk and felt lots of pins and needles on the back of my hands and feet. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at that time. i also felt a lot of pressure on the inside of my skin all over my body. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that and it was a bit uncomfortable.  The next day i was too dizzy to walk without becoming very nauseous.  I still had pins and needles on my feet. i had chills as well which i guess is a good sign.  my appetite was fine. i felt clear-headed as well.  Two days after the shot i felt slightly dizzy and by the third day i felt fine except for minor muscle cramps all over my body.  For the three days after the shot i also had some pretty strong forearm and calf muscle cramps and my arms (biceps and triceps) felt pumped up like i just had a great arm workout, but they weren&#39;t swollen at all.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

                                                Initially had deltoid pain and swelling for 1 day, improved, then 2 days after vaccine started with swelling and pain over medial elbow. Today still has some swelling in deltoid in addition to pain/swelling in medial elbow. Symptoms also consistent with medial epicondylitis, uncertain if vaccine is contributing.

No chest pain, no fevers, chills, cough. He saw his PCP for these symptoms who ordered EKG and CXR 1 day PTA which per patient were normal--plan was for referral to cardiologist.

He went home as he was not feeling well however proceeded to have another 2-3 episodes of loss of consciousness at home witnessed by his girlfriend--the later 2 occurred while lying down and were not clearly associated with any presyncopal symptoms.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. This 43-year-old male patient, height: 66.22 cm &amp; weight: 175 kg, received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8734), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Apr2021 17:00 (at the age of 43-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient was not enrolled in the clinical trial. Medical history included LASIK eye surgery. Concomitant medication(s) included prednisolone acetate (manufacturer unknown) and moxifloxacin (manufacturer unknown) both were taken after LASIK eye surgery. On 19Apr2021 12:30, the patient experienced Bell&#39;s palsy. The clinical course was described as follows: On 19Apr2021 at 12:30, the patient was eating lunch and he noticed the left side of his face was a little numb. The patient states he thought originally that he might be having an allergic reaction, but he was eating the same food that he always eats so it couldn&#39;t have been that and sort of ignored it. About 21:30, 22:00 at night (19Apr2021), he realized in the shower that he could not open his right eye, right eyelid, then his face was numb and he couldn&#39;t form his mouth to make a whistle, and he still can&#39;t, and he thought he was having a stroke because his face was all messed up. So that&#39;s when he went to the emergency room and they did a CAT scan that determined it was not a stroke, it is Bell&#39;s Palsy. The patient stated they prescribed him medications to take, and he was not hospitalized and discharged home. The patient stated his eyelids, they don&#39;t blink at the same rate and his left eye doesn&#39;t close all the way, he had to force it closed and it&#39;s very annoying. The patient verified that all his symptoms began on 19Apr2021 at 12:30 and all symptoms have worsened. The patient stated that he is perfectly healthy, not overweight and he&#39;s never had it before, and it came right out of the blue. The clinical outcome of the Bell&#39;s palsy was not resolved.

A 43-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ew0161) at the age of 43-years-old, intramuscular in left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. He has no COVID prior to vaccination and denied being allergic to anything. There was no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in a workplace clinic on 20Apr2021 and experienced syncopal episode with mild seizure activity at 11:15, within the 15-minute period post vaccination (as reported). No treatment was given in response to the events. It was unknown if the patient was tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time. However, the information provided is very limited and does not allow for a complete medical assessment. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

                                                As soon as I received the shot and went into the waiting area, I experienced a tingling sensation down my right arm where the injection was administered. Throughout the 15 minutes the sensation began to radiate throughout my body and extremities. I waited about 20 minutes before deciding to leave the facility and proceed with my afternoon.  Once I got home, I experienced chills, which I read on the pamphlet was an expected side effect. Both hands and feet were cold and I put on additional layers and lied on the couch and rested. During that time I began to notice the tingling sensation/paresthesia predominantly in the injected (right) arm, but also sporadically in other parts of my body including thigh (front/back), left arm, elbow, back, torso, neck, head, wrists, buttocks, etc. This sensation continued as I prepared for bed and continues as of this writing.  It&#39;s difficult to say whether the sensation is getting better or worse, but it is consistent best described as someone pricking you every so often.

A 44-years-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20Jan2021 14:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at Public Health Clinic/Veterans Administration facility. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR), 40 mg daily, butalbital, caffeine, paracetamol (FIORICET). The patient experienced elevated blood pressure (180/116 highest recorded), dizziness and weakness lasting several hours on 20Jan2021 14:30 with outcome of recovering. The events were considered life-threating (immediate risk of death from the event) and resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care visit. No treatment was performed. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I had trouble getting warm and had to utilize multiple blankets to gain heat, which is not normal.  I was very warm and most likely developed a fever.

This 44-year-old Nurse (Patient) reported that he received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) at single dose for vaccination in Jan2021 around 9:45am. Relevant medical history included ongoing Mild shrimp allergy  and ongoing Hypertension. Relevant concomitant drugs included amlodipine at 10 mg once daily for Hypertension since Feb2020 and ongoing. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None.  Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was None. The patient was administered the COVID Vaccine around 9:45am; about 10 minutes later he had onset of little muscle twitches on the left side of his body that started in the calf then the glute, then the quadricep, then the bicep and then just started bouncing around everywhere on left side. Approximately a half an hour after that those little muscle twitches started on the right side of his body. Now the little muscle twitches are just everywhere; his hand, his heel, right now as he is speaking he is having the little muscle twitches in his heel; This event has been ongoing since onset; but changed today around 5:00am when he felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines which is probably impossible, but it feels like it is not just muscular now, like it is happening in his intestines which concerns him. The little muscle twitches do not hurt, he thinks that is probably why he has waited a week to call; but the fact that they are ongoing and changed today, worsened is unsettling. He reported since that first dose of COVID Vaccine was administered he has also had low grade fever; muscle soreness; muscle tiredness. He reported that a rapid response team was called immediately because of the initial reaction he had. Later that day his hands were a little shaky, he got very diaphoretic and the nurses on the unit of the hospital said he almost fell which he does not recall at all; in response to those events he was taken to the emergency department where they did a complete workup including labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), checked his heart and everything was fine; no notable results from any of those tests. The patient was not admitted to the hospital; under observation in emergency room only. Outcome of events Little muscle twitches, Low grade fever, Muscle soreness and Muscle soreness was not resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

He is currently a highway patrol officer. While driving in his patrol car, at 1035, he felt tightness in the back of his neck and tightness to his airway- he described it feeling like someone hit him in the neck. He denied having any trouble breathing. Later, he noted his hand was twitching. 1045, he came back to lobby and made an RN aware who brought him to employee health. He declined to go to ED (I found out later).  BP was 153/115 HR 102  initially, no hx of high bp.  No noted hives or swelling to face or mouth/tongue or L deltoid region.  Pt. denied feeling any itching anywhere.  Pt. rested for about 15 minutes on exam table. Re-check of BP was 151/113 HR 84.  Pt. states he feels better and feel like that feeling of tightness in his neck is decreasing.   Made aware to follow up with PCP regarding BP and giving informational handout regarding blood pressure.  RN recommended he go to any ED if he has any trouble breathing, swelling of tongue, etc at any time after he leaves this hospital. Pt. verbalized understanding.

The pain became worse over the next several days resulting in what I&#39;d describe as an electrical shock/burning feeling whenever I moved my left arm the wrong way (seemingly pinching the lymph nodes). I&#39;m currently on day 5 of the pain and it&#39;s still present although it has lessened on the 5th day. On the 2nd day the pain started to move down from the armpit closer to the pectoral.

                                                Left arm pain that starts  at the injection site from the second shot and then radiates down the length of the arm to the fingers causes the pinky and ring fingers to go numb . This started about 2-3 weeks after the second vaccination right after the bruise at the injection site resolved. It gets worse if I use the arm a lot . It also hurts if I don&#39;t use the arm too but not as frequently. I have demonstrably less strength in the pinky and ring fingers when comparing left to right hand. I went to the doctor and have been referred to a neurologist but the earliest appointment available is in April. No treatment for the pain was initiated until evaluation from the neurologist in April.  The pain is getting worse and the numbness in the fingers is getting worse as well as time progresses to the point  it is interfering with sleep and normal activities.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

This 45-year-old male Other-HCP received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, NDC number: 59267-1000-1) on 22Dec2020 at single dose in his right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant drug were not reported. It was reported that patient experienced Fever on 27Dec2020 with outcome was recovered on 29Dec2020, chills and night sweats on 27Dec2020 with outcome was not recovered, Headache on 27Dec2020 with outcome was not recovered, muscle pain 27Dec2020 with outcome was not recovered, gastric upset on 27Dec2020 with outcome was Recovering, Fatigue on 27Dec2020 with outcome was unknown, arm soreness on 22Dec2020 with outcome was not recovered, joint pain with outcome was unknown, it doesn&#39;t seem to be feeling well with outcome was unknown, sweating with outcome was unknown. All events were serious (medical significant). Caller stated that he thought having a reaction to the vaccination, spoken with Occupational Health at his job and with a doctor, stated everyone is a bit stumped. Caller stated he has had for over a week now, fever, chills, night sweats, that he will randomly start sweating, headache, joint pain, gastric upset, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be feeling well. Stated the joint pain is actually more muscle pain. Stated he got the vaccination on Tuesday 22Dec2020, stated he has been having these symptoms for over 5 days now. Stated he does not think this is something infectious, that no one in his family is getting sick, his wife or child are not catching it from him. Stated he tried to do research online for data about delayed side effects, would like to know if we have any information on delayed side effects. Stated he considers these events medically significant because he cannot be cleared to go back to work. Stated he had mild arm soreness right after he got the vaccine, states he had mild muscle aches Wednesday and Thursday, then they went away and came back all on Saturday night and Sunday. Stated he is worried about getting a second vaccine. Stated he tested negative for the COVID on 29Dec2020. Stated he has a CBC and other blood work scheduled for today, results unknown at this time.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                While on duty and in uniform as an emergency paramedic I received my second  scheduled covid19 vaccination.  Approximately five minutes after receiving  C19 dose 2 vaccination (1335hrs). I experienced a syncopal episode while walking back to my work area and was lowered to the ground by another EMS provider. I was then placed in a wheelchair by the  EMS provider and an RN and taken to the emergency department at Medical Center. (1337hrs)  I  regained alertness and felt severe nausea and general weakness and was assisted into in ER bed.  Staff doctor attended along with RN . An assessment was completed, 12 lead EKG completed, IV established, 8mg Zofran administered, 1000ml of Normal Saline was bolused. Labs were drawn.  ED staff continued to monitor me for the next  2 plus hours I was monitored for anaphylaxis and other symptoms. My symptoms of nausea mostly resolved and my strength returned.  A Resident MD completed a final evaluation and determined it was safe for me to be discharged. (1607hrs)

Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Outcome of events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of polyneuropathy and facet joint diagnosis/new left forefoot paresthesia due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including nerve conduction tests, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 45-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Batch/lot number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 13Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced fatigue on 17Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, achiness in his legs and hands on 18Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, chills on 18Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, injection site swelling and achiness on 13Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Jan2021. The patient reported after he got the first COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 he experienced fatigue, achiness, and injection site swelling. Patient wanted to know if this is normal after the first dose and this was discussed. Patient explained that the fatigue - this didn&#39;t start until 17Jan2021 and was ongoing. On 18Jan2021 he starting having achiness in his legs and hands and he also had a few chills today. The injection site swelling and achiness there, was gone after the 14Jan2021. Patient was really looking for an answer to his question on if it was normal or should he get a COVID test. He was on day 5 after getting the vaccine and from what he read most people have side effects within a 24 hours and gone within 48 hours. Some of his side effect didn&#39;t start until 4 days later. The Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Patient did not go to Emergency Room or Physician Office. There was no Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks).

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 45-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL6269), via an unspecified route of administration in Left arm on 04Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 45-years-old) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. 51 hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting down watching a film. His left arm began to tingle, and he felt a wave of dizziness and nausea come over him. He stood up, walked a few steps and sat back down. He broke out in a cold sweat, chills, and saw stars. He leaned forward with his head in his hands, and apparently fainted for a moment and lost control of his bladder. All events started on 06Feb2021 06:00 PM. No treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021. No covid prior vaccination, no Covid tested post vaccination, no known allergies.

At about 29-30 hours, noticed mild numb feeling along right jawline from middle of mouth to right ear, and around the right ear. By morning (about 48 hours post vaccination), numb feeling appears gone on right jawline, but seems to have moved to left jawline (still mild). No trouble breathing or eating at all. Consulted primary care doctor out of concern over odd sensation, but not treatments at this time. Considering taking a benadryl tablet just to see if it has any effect.

I don?t notice it unless I flick the right pinky fingertip with my right thumb. It seems to be the same amount of numbness during all these days, without change.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 45-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at 11:00 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing systemic lupus erythematosus (Lupus), ongoing hypertension (High Blood Pressure), ongoing gout and hip arthroplasty from Dec2020 to an unknown date; all diagnosed about 20 years ago. Concomitant medications included allopurinol, atorvastatin, benzonatate, chlorthalidone, apixaban (ELIQUIS), hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (HYDROCODONE/ACETAMINOPHEN), hydroxychloroquine, iron, loratadine, losartan potassium, mycophenolate mofetil, omeprazole, paricalcitol, prednisone, spironolactone and valacyclovir [valaciclovir] and vitamin D NOS. The reporter&#39;s husband had a reaction to the vaccine. She was wondering if it is ok to have the second dose. He got paralysis, Bell&#39;s Palsy on 14Feb2021. She clarified vaccine as COVID19 Vaccine. She would like any information available about second dose after having Bell&#39;s Palsy with the first dose. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

At this time, they transported me to the ER, which is right across the street for evaluation and treatment.  Mercy ER physician  ran bloodwork, an ekg, and a shoulder xray.  All tests had good results and I was later released with some medication.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

                                                I received the vaccine on 3/21.  On 4/1 I had a breakthrough grand mal seizure walking down the street after being seizure free for almost 5 years.  The seizure resulted in a fractured vertebra (T12).  On 4/5, while resting at home I woke up and had another seizure sitting in a relax the back chair.    I had a mri on my brain that I understand came back normal.  The doctors aren?t sure what caused the seizures but increased my dosage by 500 mgs per day despite my previous dosage controlling my seizures for about 5 years prior to my vaccine.   No doctor has definitively stated the seizures were caused by the vaccine.  However, the timing has prompted me to notify you of these events.

Caller states he has an appointment with a neurologist and he&#39;s trying to get it moved up. Caller states his doctor wants to do a lumbar puncture to rule out MS or Parkinson&#39;s that sort of thing. Caller states but at this point they are trying to rule things out. Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

Doctor instructed to keep taking Valtrex and prescribed a Z pack , I was already taking the Valtrex with little to worsening effect BUT after administering the Z pack condition quickly deminished and went completely away within 2 days.

Patient states that he got the Pfizer vaccination yesterday second shot evening and then developed some subjective fevers sweats and chills.  Also had myalgias this all lasted approximately 2 hours but he was able to get to bed and fall asleep.  Woke up this morning feeling better but still with some chills but noticed some tenderness and redness in his right upper mid thigh.  This got progressively worse.  Continues to have chills but improving.    ED work-up including CBC unremarkable, CMP with mild hyponatremia and hypokalemia of 134 and 3.4 respectively.  ED drew blood cultures and then started vancomycin.  Vitals normal and stable in ED.  Admitted to hospital.  Provider notes on 2nd day of admission as follows.  Cellulitis and abscess of the right medial thigh likely secondary to a skin tag tear which introduced infection.  Patient currently is on broad-spectrum antibiotics in the form of doxycycline and vancomycin.  Unfortunately, the patient has been eating just ate lunch and also has been getting Lovenox.  He is not going to tolerate a bedside incision and drainage.  We will plan on proceeding to the operating room tomorrow for quick I&amp;D and cultures.  Procedures been explained.  The wound will need to be packed afterwards and ultimately healed in.  Patient seems understand plan and we will proceed accordingly

                                                Approximately 10 hours after receiving my second COVID shot and right before I went to bed at 10pm I started getting chills.  My symptoms worsened as the night went on, I was shaking and could not get warm.  I also had a very bad headache and I had trouble lifting myself up.  At about 3am I started sweating and feeling feverish.  I got out of bed to take Tylenol and drink water, and had trouble walking and I was breathing heavy.   At 6am I decided to take a hot bath with Epsom salts to help with my aches and headache.  When I got out of the bath I felt very dizzy and fatigued and need assistance from my wife to get back in bed.  At about 9am I started feeling better.  I sat myself up and ate apples and salty tortilla chips and drank lots of water.  By 1pm I was able to walk without difficulty and I felt better with only a mild headache.

                                                I have never had a seizure in my life before or since, but that morning I had five partial focal seizures in y right arm, over the course of six minutes.  As I was on the phone (to report the first one to my caregiver) when the second hit, I inadvertently punched myself rapidly and repeatedly in the right side of my head, with the phone handset functioning as an impromptu bludgeon, leaving bruises reminiscent of the victim of a fist fight.  Also at the time I had a strong headache, cold chills, a 102 degree Fahrenheit fever and body aches.  None of which persisted beyond noon.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

But the second dose of this vaccine (on 2/7/2021) was different. In addition to the severe pain on my left arm, I had (and still) a severe headache, pains all over my body and bones, high fever (102), dizziness, shaking, fatigue, cold at all times, and a little bit taste loss (as of right now, 24 hours after the vaccine). It looks like a hard flu symptoms exactly.

                                                On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

January 9  - ER - Diagnosed cellulitis - round of Ceflex for a week - things got worse. Since January 9, I&#39;ve had two other separate ER visits and three rounds of CEFLEX. Was referred to Dermatology - Arrhythmia Nodusem  - so now I&#39;m off Ceflex and on a steroid regimen now. I just started it today. It hurts to even touch my skin and it hurts to walk.I&#39;m in  a lot of pain. I have no open wounds so no reason for this to happen.

My stomach has been in constant pain.  I?ve also had a slight fever and a very sore arm.  Tylenol and rest has worked for the fever and arm, and I&#39;ve had some addition body aches.  Not sure how much is due to being in bed for an extended period.  Also on Friday (about 24 hrs after getting the shot I was pretty fatigued.  I just woke up from 13 hours of sleeping.  But the stomach cramps/pains was severe and prompted me to try to find a way to report it, especially since it doesn&#39;t seem to be too common.  It&#39;s been really bad.

As the days have gone on it?s gotten a little worse. Left under arm pain, armpit area, left chest (pectoral) pain. Just lingering pain. Very sensitive to the touch. I also developed a rash on the left side of my spine between the shoulder blades. It  showed up this past weekend or the end of last week. It?s more of a painful rash than itchy. It?s very uncomfortable to lean against or lay on.  This is all 13 days after the second shot. I have just been taking ibuprofen for the pain.  Going to see my doctor today.

                                                Lost consciousness; fell face first onto floor; Arm pain; Chills shivering; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient). A 46-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 05Mar2021 08:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. The patient has no medical history. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient has no known allergies. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL9264) on 12Feb2021 14:30 (2:30 pm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not received other vaccines in four weeks. No COVID-19 test post vaccination was done. On 06Mar2021 at 13:45 (1:45 pm), the patient lost consciousness and fell face first onto floor. The patient also experienced arm pain and chills shivering. No treatment was received. The event required doctor&#39;s office visit. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

Pain persisted 7/10 for first 12 hours from onset, gradually lowering to level of 2/10 over 48 hours and then 1/10 after 72 hours.   Onset of pain occurred without physical stress to the region (was quietly sitting in a chair).  Pain similar to when I herniated L5-S1 years ago (requiring hospital transport).   Pain was controlled to tolerable levels by immobilization (lie on floor with knees elevated, application of heat, and ibuprofen.   I did not associate this with the vaccine initially, but after consulting with my doctor, he recommended I report, as he stated there were some earlier reports about back pain with the similar Moderna vaccine, and there isn&#39;t a physical explanation otherwise as to why the sudden pain.

A 46-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 27Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack (at the age of 39) and had couple of stents (and the things done) later after that, and Lyme disease (past this Summer). The patient was taking several concomitant medications (unspecified). The patient&#39;s mother was calling for her son (patient) as he works out on the road, but he has had a heart attack at 39 years old and has had some other problems. The patient got his first Pfizer shot and about 2 to 3 days later while he was working, he first just had the sore arm on 03Mar2021. The patient worked in fiber glass repair on pools and it was very warm, and he started having muscle cramps all over the body on 03Mar2021. The patient ended up in the hospital on 03Mar2021 and his sugar was very high, and he was dehydrated. As treatment taken for the events, they gave him fluids through an IV and they gave him metformin medication 500 mg. The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures (his doctor did the laboratory work), and they did laboratory work at the hospital where he went. It was clarified that they just did blood work on 03Mar2021, but the patient&#39;s mother didn&#39;t know what it was. The patient was just held for observation and was out the next day (04Mar2021). That was only the first shot, so the patient was really afraid to get the second shot one. The patient&#39;s mother told him she will try to find out something about it. patient&#39;s mother looked up the side effects and she did not see that as a side effect. At the time of reporting, the patient still had cramps once in a while. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Muscle cramps all over the body&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

A 46-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 04Apr2021 14:45 (Lot Number: ER8732) as a single dose (at the age of 46-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing gout (controlled), and Bell&#39;s palsy from an unknown date (patient had Bell&#39;s palsy 13 years before). Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medication included allopurinol (300 mg) at 300 mg from an unknown date for gout.  The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 12Apr2021 the patient experienced Bell&#39;s palsy.  The patient started symptoms on 12Apr2021 and progressed to facial paralysis on 23Apr2021 which was finally diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy. The Bell&#39;s Palsy is stable and has not improved much yet. Clinical course is as follows: on Monday, 12Apr2021 one and a half weeks after the vaccine the patient&#39;s symptoms began, he had minimal symptoms on 10Apr2021 and on 23Apr2021 he had facial paralysis and on that day he started treatment. On Friday (date not specified) the patient had facial weakness. The reporter considered the event non-serious. The reporter would like to know the post-marketing incidence of Bell&#39;s palsy and the reporter was trying to decide whether the patient (reporter&#39;s son) gets second dose of Pfizer Covid BioNTech Vaccine or forgoes it. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result Bell&#39;s palsy included treatment with high-dose prednisone and valicyclovir (VALTREX). The clinical outcome of the Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The reporter stated that this (Bell&#39;s palsy) may be a random event or a related event.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between event Bell&#39;s Palsy and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

                                                Monday morning I woke up with itchy red hives in several parts of my body, Tuesday morning since the symptoms were not any better (legs, torso) I decided to go to the walk in clinic at work and they suggested me to take some OTC Benadryl and it did work the same day and the rest of the day. The next day around lunch time the hives came back again I had a very red and tingling area around my neck and in my head. I returned to the walk in clinic and they gave me shot of Benadryl and prednisone and another drug I do not remember.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days.

This 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; borderline diabetes. Concomitant medications included losartan; alirocumab (PRALUENT, injection) on 20Jan2021. Since 23Jan2021, patient was dizzy all along and almost fainted and was still having symptoms of mild migraine and he don&#39;t know like some light sensitivity. Doctor believed it was from vaccine. Patient was wondering how long was this going to be last as he had second shot coming out. He didn&#39;t think it was an adverse reaction and he thought he should get the second shot. But this was continuing to me and it had already been two weeks and patient still having symptoms of mild migraine. Patient was worried about taking the second shot as a result. He had never had a migraine before and was told it was probably from the vaccine and that was not something he wanted to hear. Patient wanted to know if this was normal to still be having this side effect for this long. Patient was taking acetaminophen (for migraine), it was not a TYLENOL, it was from a different brand. Patient did liver and cholesterol test and blood test in Jan2021 at Cardiologist and they came back fine, nothing was found there. The outcome of event migraine was not resolved. The outcome of rest events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Within a half hour, I felt dizzy and light headed. in 45 minutes - I could barely stay awake. I had to stop driving. Within two hours, I had a bad headache. I became slightly agitated that day. The headache lasted throughout the day - I took Ibuprofen but that didn&#39;t help much. Sunday, the headache was still there. It wasn&#39;t a migraine; but intense. I was agitated.  My agitation level grew and my irritability grew and the headache I had the whole day. Sunday evening about 7 pm the agitation and irritability got very intense - I was having impulse control issues with it. I don&#39;t have anger issues but I wanted to yell at TV or throw my phone. From 8- midnight, I was lethargic and fatigued - I didn&#39;t have the energy to roll over;: had extreme anxiety I was sweating and having weird thoughts like harming my animals and harming myself; my  mind was racing and then I would get really depressed. Until about midnight, I have had past struggles with anxiety and depression - there had been a past feeling like this - but it was really extreme - it was worse night of my life. Lasted four hours, and finally I slept for about one hour. I remember thinking, I finally can take a breath. My racing thoughts were gone and sweating was gone. The irritability had subsided enough that I could try to gain control of my thoughts again. I had really bad nightmares the rest of that night; I was confused _ I didn&#39;t know where I was - confused about that - occurred about three different times until I got up at 5:30 am for work. To summarize, for the next week, I had moments of anxiety and depression. I had mental fog. I played pro football - and I had post concussion syndrome. It was very identifiable to what I had had. So this was occurring in moments - forgetful; depressed; and random moments of anxiety - like I was going to go play football again. 7-10 days - it got a little better each day. Ten days it took to subside. I still exercised and taking extra fluids to get back to my normal.  Exercised help. No fever occurred. With COVID - I had had a sense of anxiety and depression and some mental fog when I had COVID I didn&#39;t have it to this extreme.  Did not get the second dose.

The day after vaccination,  patient was complaining of fatigue with subjective fevers and rigors with associated headache and neck stiffness and on the day of presentation he complained of increased fatigue and general malaise for which he left work early and was ultimately found poorly responsive in his private vehicle with concern for possible seizure activity.  He was brought to ER by ambulance.  He reported numbness in hands and legs, rigidity, and an episode of urinary incontinence.  He was started on empiric antibiotics for possible CNS infection, lumbar puncture completed. Found to have acellular CSF and antibiotics were discontinued.  Patient remains in hospital at this time with course complicated by post-LP headache.

ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

In the mirror I see the arches around the uvula swollen and red 11:50 Inform the nurse. Body starts shivering, talking and breathing is labored- according to my wife my voice sounded very different.  Nurse checks lungs through stethoscope and SPO2&#43; heart rate- All normal, does not detect any constriction of lung air passages. But I am panting while talking. 11:55 I decide to wait and monitor. Shivering slowly stops, breathing slowly starts to return to normal (in about 20 mins). The urge to pass stool stopped. 12:22 No change either way- Breathing is ok, but mild tingling around lips, and feeling of tightness at back of throat. I take 5mg Cetrizine HCl.  [Note: My mouth and throat felt like I have felt in the past with a reaction to shellfish.] 1:15 Redness at back of throat is less, and I feel normal. I drive off the parking lot of the vaccination site Next day Throat feels sore, but otherwise ok

The reporter (friend of the patient) called to file a report for his friend, who did not speak any English. The reporter wanted to make Pfizer aware of the adverse event that the patient experienced. The reporter stated that the hospital staff stated that they reported the patient&#39;s adverse event to Pfizer, the local health department and the CDC, but the patient&#39;s family and friends were not sure if the report was filed, thus the reporter was calling. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;6-7 hours after getting home from getting the vaccine on 16Mar2021, the patient started to feel fever, pain in his back, and pain in his neck that went up to his head.

The right sided headaches recurred along with right tongue numbness initially on 12/29/2020.  The symptoms worsen on 12/31/2020 and severe on 1/1/2021.  I was initially started on Valtrex thinking it maybe due to shingles but soon with the right sided facial paralysis, it was obvious it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and was started on steriods on 1/1/21 and also received acupuncture treatment on 1/2/21 which significant help improve the symptoms.  I still have some residual weakness of the right eye with some tearing and mouth weakness.

A 48-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. During the administration the patient did experience some types of reaction where it wanted medical supervision. So, basically when he did got the injection he was waiting for his 15 minute prolapse. But within probably he would say 7 to 8 minutes he started to experiencing some numbness to his left ear and usually he thought it was secondary to the that he had (not clarified) but progressively it went down to his mandible, his face and his left  shoulder numbness and he was experiencing some numbness that radiate towards his fingertips only to the left side. At that time he waived to the Nurse to supervise and at that time he wait again and a Physician came over. He checked his pulse and noted that he had normal rhythm during the pulse check and at that time and he had Emergency medical technician (EMT) come over. The EMT checked his blood pressure he thought multiple times through the left and to the right brachial. He was having what they would consider a hypertensive crisis where systolic were in 170&#39;s, 180&#39;s, diastolic numbers were between like 120&#39;s and 130&#39;s and his heart rate was in 70&#39;s. So, initially it was not anxiety induced. But he do not have no blood pressure. They wanted he to go to the hospital to treat the hypertensive crisis that was in. The patient opted not to. So he went home in a quieter environment he did have a radial blood pressure cough that he had been checking his blood pressure rigorously, tried different techniques and now he was back to normal state to 120-130 systolic and his diastolic was 70-80. This instance was weird that he did not see as a part of one of the side effects listed with Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine. No treatment received for the events, because he had no history of hypertension it was just more of decreasing the ambient around he. At that time he wanted to go to a quiet environment, took a shower and check his blood pressure. He did orthostatic while laying down sitting up, standing up and he was not hypertensive. For the causality, the nurse stated, &#34;I think it did. This is a fact I mean I was doing fine prior to administration and then this event is slowly subsiding.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported hypertensive crisis cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                woke up this morning feeling slight numbness on my left cheek.  The sensation is very similar to when I receive a numbing shot from my dentist for dental work.  The feeling of numbness comes and goes with varying levels of intensity.  Sometimes twitching my cheek can make it go away; but it keeps occurring.

                                                After the injection my arm got really sore.  I began to feel really tired and begin to have chills and shakes.  I started having diarreah and began throwing up. I had  a sever headache and body aches which all symptoms lasted for about 3 days and I felt so bad so on Wed 12/30 I went to Urgent Care and was given fluids which did make me begin to feel a little better. On Monday I was sent for a COVID test which was negative.  On Friday 1/1 i was finally able to return back to work.

I left the hospital, start driving, and suddenly felt that my right arm was heavy, numb, with a tingling sensation. I stopped the car and called the nurse and I was told that it will go away, and I can take a tylenol/motrin. It improved over the next hour and I felt it resolved a few days later but then it returned on 1/18 but not to the same extent, and I also felt intermittent tingling and numbing in my right foot. I also experienced intermittent episodes of fast heartbeats and missing heartbeats since the vaccine almost daily. I was fatigued and extremely thirsty for 3 days but that resolved completely.

At that time the physician  asked a EMT perofrmed four evalautions of my BP and my BP was reading syttolically between was 140-150 and my datolics was reading 110-115. Throughout that time the numbness was still to my left side of my face and shoulder and arm and to myfingers. This was only localized to those two areas.  At that time it was requested for me to go to the hospital to seek medical attention. I deferrred to going home to check my BP and at that time i was running 150/100.  The numbness was still present and mu thought process my body was stressed out. I then took a nice cold shower with breathing techniques. I did orthastatics on myself. I then followed with my PCP the next day and she ordered bunch of labs, CRP, triponents, CBC, bubble study and chest x-ray and EKG. ALl the testes were deemed to be negative.  My systolics were 120/80 when i saw my PCP, however i was recommedned to take the whole week off and was recommended to go back to work after the new year.  After five days the numbness went away to my digits went away but not to my face.  My grips were equal. I had no Bal palsy nor stroke.  The numbness sill persisted up till day 9 and the umbness to the face went away.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer EK5730 at 18:07 on 12-30-2020.  For the first day my arm was a bit sore but nothing to bad.  The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

So much that I was worried my muscles would begin to sieze up and cramp.  I had warm clothes and 5 blankets and could not get warm for over 2 hours.  Elevated heart rate and breathing.  Nothing warmed me.  Eventually (and with ibuprofen) the incident subsided.  I felt weak and just &#34;off&#34; with slight body aces and fatigue for the next day and a half.

I was fine all day, but near bedtime felt like something was beginning to happen.  My upper left arm was also sore from the injection.  I fell asleep at 11:30 PM and awoke at 1:00 AM with body aches and chills.  I was never able to get back asleep the entire night.  The following morning, March 22, I had body aches, chills, shaking and a terrible headache all day.  All of these symptoms continued throughout the day and evening.  I stayed hydrated with Gatorade and Sprite and ate very light foods.  By the next morning, March 23, the headache was gone, but still have a little remaining of the body aches.  No more chills or shaking.  Moving slow still, but getting better.

Few days after that I developed numbness and weakness on my left side and pins and needles in my Left index finger. I saw my primary care doctor twice that week. He started me on low dose Prednisone and gabapentin for the pain while sleeping. When the nerve pain/numbness did not subside, I asked for a neurology referral. Two doctors saw me for brachial plexus neuritis. I have had 2 ultrasound guided and one fluoro guided cortisone shots along the nerve. I have also been going to PT 2-3 x/week to regain my strength on the Left side &amp; calm nerve.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EL0142) intramuscularly at right shoulder approximately at 17:30 on 29Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity (a little over weight but he is fit). The patient had COVID in the end of Apr2020. The patient had no family medical history and had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no concomitant medication. The second day of the vaccination, the patient called to report body aches, headache, chills, low grade temperature. As he reported, he just woke up and was walking around feeling like he had 1000 pounds on his back and felt like crap. The body aches started in his shoulder and currently all over his neck, back and whole body aches. Chills started last night (vaccination night). He was just trying to get to sleep and had to put an extra sweatshirt on last night. He did not check his temperature until he got up and it was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit. He was not able to provide a start date for the temperature. &#34;Body aches, headache between, chills between, low grade temperature (unspecified start date), feels like crap&#34; were considered developing between 24:00-01:00. He stated that they were all medically significant and he needs a day to recover hopefully. He just felt like he was hit by a truck. The patient had not visited physician or went to ER yet. The outcome of low grade temperature was unknown, chills was resolving and all other events did not resolve at the time of reporting.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events vaccination site pain, headache, chills, and pyrexia were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. The association between the other reported events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded based on temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Those symptoms persisted for approximately 12 hours after which I continued to experience injection site pain, but began to experience pain with some numbness that radiated from the injection site distally down my arm and into my pinky and ring fingers on my left hand.  No other symptoms.  As of today the injection site pain persists as does the pain and numbness in my pinky and ring fingers, but I get the feeling that it is getting slightly worse.  The pain and slight numbness is present when I awake, but gets worse throughout the day.  Some evenings there is considerable discomfort.

It would randomly come and go from literally every area of my body and this was so pronounced it was hard to fall asleep that night.  Thur 1/21.  Leg pain gone but still week and tired.  Pins and needles sensation better but not gone.   Friday 1/22 same as 1/21 Saturday 1/21 same as 1/21.  Tried to do a little work around the house and was exhausted.

The pain did not subside until later in the evening. I continued to have discomfort and pain on and off throughout the week. On 1/25/2021, I again woke up with extreme pain in my right arm. I have tried ibuprofen and different arm positions to reduce the pain and discomfort without any luck. The arm is tender/sore.  I am not sure if this is a reaction to the vaccine or if the needle protruded too far when administered.  I have an MRI scheduled to rule out any type of injury.

Tuesday evening, my wife noticed that I am not fully blinking/closing my right eye; Feb 17, 2021 Wednesday, I didn&#39;t have the same pain but there&#39;s numbness on my right cheek extending to my right lips.  Wednesday afternoon around 2pm, I went to my dentist thinking it was due to my Invisalign which I started on Jan 25, 2021.  The dentist told me it is most likely Bell&#39;s palsy so I decided to go to Emergency.

                                                Early Wednesday morning (2/24) around 5:00AM, I woke up to extreme pain in my left arm, primarily along the upper forearm, inside of my elbow, and lower bicep. There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They&#39;ve prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week. The right arm pain is less than the left arm pain, but at this point seven days later, I am experiencing neuropathic pain in both arms.

I also felt like I had a bit of a lump in my throat. I called the Doctor&#39;s office and spoke with a nurse who suggested I take Benadryl.  I did so at around midnight and that seemed to take care of things.  Went to bed and woke up the next morning feeling ok (though groggy from the Benadryl).

                                                Peripheral, digital neuropathy: Dysaethesia in fingers Dig 4 and 3, first occurence in the left Hand. The dysaesthesia was self limting (at least to date  and lasted ca 5 days), now I have it on the right hand on Dig 4. No motor function issues observed, purely dysaethetic in nature. Tactililty altered and reduced. Whole finger is affected, albeit distal lateral portion most. No other issues, left hand , Dig 4 is almost back to normal sensation (80%). No neurological history personal or in the family- ever. No treatment attempted, resp what would help anyway?

For 4 days I had to have a nap during the day because I ran out of energy.  However, since that shot I feel like I have been living in a &#34;brain fog&#34; because I can tell I&#39;m processing things slower and it&#39;s not getting better.

A 49-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported) via unspecified route of administration in the arm right on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced drug allergy; also received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EJ1685) via unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: clinic. It was reported that on 23Jan2021, couple of days after the second shot, patient experienced skin on hands and the bottom of my feet started to peel off and bleeding and very painful in the fingers and the feet.  The events resulted in both: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and Emergency room/department or urgent care. It was unknown if treatment received for the events. Outcome of all events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship and known drug profile, a contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded in the development of bleeding, skin exfoliation and pain in extremity.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The next morning, I woke up in the middle of the night due to some discomfort. I was at 100 BPm (normally at 60).

The numbness was throughout my entire arm but was especially pronounced along the outside down to the pinky finger. Within about 2hours the numbness also affected my left leg along the outside of the leg to the pinky toe and all around the lower thigh. Symptoms still present 8 hours after injection at time of writing this description.

                                                He felt very bad the night he received the 2nd shot of Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on April 27. He even joked he probably would die that night. He also complained that despite his protest, the person who administered the shot insisted to inject on his shoulder joint.  He developed a bigger-than-quarter-size bruise on his right inner arm the next day. He was feeling tired the following days. On May 4 around 3:30, I heard he was making loud noises. I came to his side immediately. At the time I thought he was making louder than usual snores. I nudged him gently but he didn&#39;t respond.  After about 15 seconds, the sound stopped, and he had no breath. I then called 911 within 10 seconds, tried to do CPR on him. It took EMS 6 minutes to arrive even though we live very close to a fire station in a well-accessed urban area. EMS worked on him for about 30 minutes before transported him to hospital. They continued to work on him for a while. He never regained breath.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                12 minutes after receiving the 2nd covid vaccination, I felt flushed and became diaphoretic. I felt heart palpitations and checked my heart rate which was 117, increasing to a max of 123.  I was placed on a pulse ox monitor, which showed 93%, BP was elevated at 146/85. I was not given any  medical treatment, and was placed on a monitor for one hour.  Once my hr and 02 stas were at my baseline, I was allowed to be discharged. I went back to my department and  decided to go home, as I felt tired and was mildly nauseous.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

A 50-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the left arm, on 07Jan2021, at 11:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and no known allergies . There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first vaccine of bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020, at 12:00 PM, Intramuscular, on the Right arm for Covid-19 immunization, he had numbness in his right hand x2 days. On 09Jan2021, following second dose, he has had numbness in both hands x2 days and on 10Jan2021, day 2, he ran a fever and his lighter weight facial fillers swelled and were painful (around the eyes - not my lip fillers). His eyes have a mix of Juvaderm products. It spontaneously resolved after 1 day with a subjective loss in overall volume. Density of the product used seemed to be a factor in the response. He knows this has been reported with the Moderna product, but he does not believe is has been reported with our product. It appears the response may not be product specific, but more specific to the type of vaccine. The patient has no Covid prior vaccination and not covid tested post vaccination. No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2020.

About 25 minutes after the injection, I was concerned (possibly too anxious) and I decided to return to the site. I crossed the bridge and sat down at the bridge gate. The personnel there called an EMT, and about 15 minutes later the EMT came to talk to me and take my blood pressure and pulse Oxygen. Blood pressure was 137 - 87. Pulse Ox was 100%. By that time I had calmed down the sensation in my legs had eased. Approximately 2 hours after the injection I began to feel soreness in my joints (and this did not pre-occupy me, since I knew that feeling the beginning of aches and pains a couple hours after injection is normal). It is now 6 hours and 32 minutes after the injection, and I am feeling ok. It was quite probably anxiety on my end. The folks in city were very nice to me at the pedestrian bridge gate. I have noted talking the EMT below as health professional visit, I also plan to go see Dr. prior to the 2nd shot.

                                                I have experienced low-level numbness/tingling in my left hand; primarily in my thumb and index finger. Range of motion has been normal. No pain either. Strangely it began 1 week after my first injection. It was intermittent in the time after that and before the 2nd injection. On the day of the second injection I experienced renewed symptoms in the same hand immediately after receiving my 2nd dose. I spoke with the attending physician at the time and was told that she had heard about some instances of numbness but it would probably fade with time. Unfortunately I am now over 2 weeks since the second dose was administered and my symptoms have been nearly constant and do not appear to be waning.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

                                                Initial confusion upon waking at 7AM. Uncomfortable but unable to determine why. Tried to re-arrange pillows but could not get arms to complete the process even though fully mobile. A minor amount of weakness in arms/legs and tingling across the lower face, particularly on the right side. Once up, had an inability to form words even though thoughts were coherent. Minor difficulty swallowing water. Speech slurred badly enough to be incomprehensible to my wife. By 7:30 we arrived at the hospital where symptoms were improving.

The pain was focused on the back side of the left testicle and radiated up the inguinal canal into the abdomen. It was present on palpation and intermittently without palpation. Pain came on quickly and subsided over 24 hours. No penile discharge, fever, or other signs were present.

I also has the worst headache of my life, ibuprofen didn?t help it.  The next morning (Friday) I felt somewhat better but by noon, I felt just as bad as the night before and the horrible headache was back.  Saturday and Sunday were exactly like Friday.  Monday morning, my arm was back to normal and the horrible headache was gone.  Since them I?ve had headaches on and off, but not as horrible as Thursday thru Sunday. This afternoon marks 1 week since my first of 2 doses.  I?m not sure at this point if I want to get the 2nd dose or not when it?s due.

                                                Approximately 3 days after the injection I had a bad breakout of acne on my scalp and on my temples.  I went to the dermatologist and this was treated with Doxycycline Hyclate.  The bad breakout of acne cleared up in about 1-1.5 weeks.  At the two week mark I started to have a burning sensation near my left eye that felt like a sunburn or some nerve tingling.  I interpreted this to potentially be the early signals of shingles so I started taking Valtrex.  I will take a 1,000 mg dosage of Valtrex twice a day for 7 days to treat this.  I had the Shingrex vaccine on 12/19/19 and 4/29/20.  I feel like both of these issues were potential side effects from the Covid vaccine.

Approximately 5-7 minutes post injection experienced onset of difficulty swallowing and rapid heartbeat.  10-12 minutes post injection sensation of throat closing with some difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing increased.   15-17 minutes post injection, paramedics arrived.  Blood pressure was 169/113.  Dizzy upon standing.  20 minutes post injection paramedics administered 50mg Benadryl  due to difficulty swallowing and sensation of throat closing however it wasn?t worsening.  Paramedic asked me to rate the swallowing difficulty (1-10) which was a 5-6 but never exceeded that.  Transported to Emergency Room.

I also noticed that I started feeling really sluggish with some muscle pains.   Approximately 11:30 PM, I attempted to go to sleep and noticed that I started having a minor respiratory distress where I could hear myself wheezing.  The wheezing only lasted about one hour.   All the symptoms disappeared after 36 hours without any treatments or medications.  At this point, I&#39;m not sure If I should get my second vaccine shot.

A 50-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 06Mar2021 15:45 (at age of 50-year-old) (Lot Number: EN6206) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity. There was known allergies: bee stings and sulfa drugs. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin (LIPITOR); hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril (LISINOPRIL HCTZ); and emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TRUVADA).  The patient reported &#34;left side of face just under cheek bone feels slightly numb and tingly, left side of mouth appears very, very, very, slightly &#39;drooped&#39; like it does not match the right side of my mouth but you have to stare and look really close to notice it. Should I hold off on getting my second dose in the next 3 or 4 weeks to see how this goes?&#34; The adverse events start time was 06Mar2021 20:45. The events did not result in emergency room visit or physician office visit. It was unknown if treatment received for the events. There was no COVID prior vaccination or COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of events was not resolved.

                                                Sore arm for a day after; This is a spontaneous report from a Contactable Consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 50-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Solution for injection) via unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Her husband takes no medications. He has no medical history or conditions. He has no allergies at all. It was reported that She thought she would report some side effects after one shot of the Pfizer COVID19 Vaccine. It is strange. She didn&#39;t read the symptoms until seven days out. Then she saw some have reported a lot less. After the shot, that night she had swelling in her upper chest. She thinks it was lymph nodes in the breast and chest area on the side she got the shot. The next day her arm that she got the vaccine in got very large. Then, she doesn&#39;t know if it was related, two days later she had itching on both of her feet. It was the tops of her feet and only for a couple of days. She is not counting that. Day five after the shot has been the main problem. Her arm pits started itching like crazy. It was severe itching and swelling in her arm pits. The itching lasted for three to four days. The lymph nodes in her arm are still swollen. It was five days after the shot. It is both arm pits. The night of the shot she had a lot of neck pain and she thinks it was probably the lymph nodes in the back of her neck. That has lasted and is slowly diminishing. Height six-foot one inch or six foot two inches. Weight 225 to 230 pounds. He is not obese, but a big guy. There was an agency for assisted living for people that need help. They were giving it and had extra doses. This guy in charge at the assisted living house offered it to caller and caller&#39;s husband because her and her husband run a behavior health counseling. He offered it to them as healthcare professionals. Her husband got it at the same time and didn&#39;t even have a sore arm. Caller clarified that he did have a sore arm for a day after. It didn&#39;t swell up. The outcome of the event was &#34;Unknown&#34;.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

                                                I am a pediatric critical medicine physician and received my COVID-19 vaccine at my workplace.  1st Pfizer EH9899 (on Dec 18, 2020) and 2nd Pfiszer EL1283 (on Jan 9, 2021).  Both IM through my left arm. Directly for about less 48H post vaccination I had muscle pain that were self-resolved.  On Jan 18, 2021, I started having funny sensation (like having a foreign body) over my left eye medial /innercantus area. The next 2 days I started to have pain over my left external ear canal, then it progressed into pain over my left lower jaw, left vertex of my head, inner side of left eye. My SS progressed on 1/30/21 at around 3:30 PM to numbness over my left sided tongue and left sided lip. Then on 1/31/21 at around 5 AM, I started having left facial paralysis. I have left BELL&#39;s PALSY which was confirmed. following a negative non-contrast brain MRI to rule out stroke and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR test. I start taking Prednisone 60 mg daily and Acyclovir 1 g TID on Jan 31, 2021. To this date I still have left facial paralysis but not worsening.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization.

Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

I hit my head on a chair when I was falling and cut my head. I stayed laying down because I was still dizzy and hot. They called the squad and did vitals and I was fine. I sat there for about another half an hour and I went home. I have felt fine ever since. Only thing that hurt was my head from the fall.

                                                I was given the first shot and sent to an observation room. I felt slightly flushed, it went away. By the evening, I started to feel flushed again. I commented to my wife that I felt like my blood pressure was up. (I don&#39;t have high blood pressure). That is the best way I can describe it. I can&#39;t recall if the ringing in my ears was noticeable at that time. My the next day I could still feel the flushed feeling and the ringing  was clearly noticeable and increased over time, until it can overcome TV or someone speaking to me. I also had a feeling of persistent light headedness. About Feb 3 I had pain in my ear and went to a clinic. I was diagnosed with a minor ear infection (right). I was given and took a course of anti-biotics. The infection went away but the ringing never did, sometimes it would lessen, but always louder than prior to the shot. I went ahead and took the second shot on Feb 11, thinking my problem was probably and ear infection. I the ringing could get so loud it would wake me up and keep me awake. On Feb20 I woke up to very loud ringing, nausea, and general feeling of unease. I went to a clinic the next day. I was told there was probably some inflammation and was given a steroid shot. After about 4 hrs the ringing lessened and I felt better, the first relief I had from the start. On Feb 23, I saw my ENT Dr. He gave me a course of steroids and ordered a brain MRI. The MRI came back with negative results...no abnormal indications. The ringing is starting to increase again as of the last several days.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 29Dec2020 at 15:00 PM (at the age of 51 years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sciatica. There was no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 29Dec2020, within 4 hours of vaccination, the patient developed paresthesia&#39;s in right arm, into axilla, neck and right side of face, burning irritation of right eye. The patient was evaluated by neurologist. No treatment given. Symptoms resolved in 10 days. The clinical outcome of the events paresthesia&#39;s in right arm, into axilla, neck and right side of face, burning irritation of right eye was recovered on 08Jan2021. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.

                                                Shortly after receiving the injection my arm went ice cold all the way to my fingers and warmed up again quickly. On the way home (about an hour later) I noticed numbness and tingling in my hand and that has continued since (11 days as of this report). My upper arm muscle was sore later that evening and by the next day the pain in my upper arm was extreme. I couldn&#39;t move my arm without extreme pain. I took some tylenol late in the day and that did help cut down on some of the pain. I also put an ice pack on my upper arm but it didn&#39;t help. The pain wasn&#39;t as bad the next (3rd) day but it&#39;s still significant enough for me to restrict activity with it. There is also a burning sensation off and on as well as itching deep in my arm. My upper arm has also felt like there is a tight band around it (since day 2) although the muscles themselves don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s any tightness or knots. I took ibuprofen on day 10 and it helped a little but not a whole lot. At this point I also have what feels like swelling or tenderness under my arm near the armpit area. The pain, burning and itching in my upper arm continues as well as the numbness, tingling and pins all up and down my arm to my hand and fingers.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 08:48 am (lot number: EN6199) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included facial paralysis from 20Jan2021 to an unknown date diagnosed initially as bell&#39;s palsy but now is diagnosed as myasthenia gravis and gastric reflux. Concomitant medication included unspecified gastric reflux medication and unspecified vitamins. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior and did not receive other vaccine on the same day. The patient previously he was put on prednisone 60 mg tablets by mouth times 7 days, then 10 mg tablets for an additional 7 days. The patient mentioned he received the vaccine in a vaccination center. The patient reported that prior to his first shot towards the end of Jan2021, his doctor thought he had Bell&#39;s Palsy. On 20Jan2021, he stated that he was put on a high dose of steroids to clear it up. He stated that on 09Mar2021, he had his first Covid vaccine with no issues. On 12Mar2021 between 5-6 pm, he mentioned that it came back (the Bell&#39;s Palsy) with a vengeance, near his eye and with eye droop. He specifies left eye droop. He added that the Monday after (15Mar2021) over the weekend, it got worse. He mentioned that he talked with his neurologist who told him to speak with his ophthalmologist who the patient spoke to on Tuesday. The patient mentioned that both doctors came up with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. He inquired since one of his doctor&#39;s is concerned about him taking the second vaccine and the other doctor was ok with it. He mentioned that one doctor had a feeling of some bias, and the other doctor. He did some research in an association with people diagnosed with it. One of his doctors said that he is immunocompromised, so he looked at autoimmune information, and the information says it is ok. He reached out to the local medical center that is doing the vaccination and they are unwilling to talk with him over the phone. He has read on the association site and they seem to recommend to take it. He did not want to rebel against his doctor, so he wants to be sure. He inquired if it was safe for him to take his second dose and wanted to get good factual information that can give him a good starting point that is related. He mentioned that his second dose schedule was on 30Mar2021. He also stated that initial onset of Bell&#39;s Palsy with left eye droop, he was on a high dose steroid regimen and that seem to help which he finished up early Feb2021. It was mentioned that the event initial onset was not after the vaccine. The Ophthalmologist checked him on Tuesday and his left eye which he could barely open, and his doctor also noticed right eye droop. He stated without medication, it is worsening but with his medication, it is definitely helping to transmit between nerves. He stated before the medication this time of day he could not lift his left eye longer throughout the day, the more difficult it is for the muscles as they become weaker. There was noticeably drooping of the right eye. The ophthalmologist exam on his right eye was drooping which was ongoing. It is still there, his wife and he were comparing their eyes and how much he could open it, and it surprised them how little he could open it. It was different and strange. The time reported for the drooping of the right eye was 2:30 pm and persisting but the left eye was worse. He hasn&#39;t noticed a difference about the same, medication has been helping. It was also mentioned that myasthenia gravis reported that it started on the 16Mar2021 2:30 pm (talked to the Neurologist to compare notes, so maybe 3:30 - 4:00) when they made the initial diagnosis and started testing the next day. He is waiting for blood work to come back, but all the tests have pointed in that direction. Myasthenia gravis was ongoing, but the condition has worsened and the medications at a therapeutic level, it keeps it at bay. He further added that his eye became so hard to see, so he pyridostigmine bromide on 17Mar2021 since he couldn&#39;t open or focus, he thought he would give it a try. It works when he can&#39;t focus and if he doesn&#39;t take, it he will go back to where he was before. He will not be able to open his eye and the double vision will come back. The events required physician&#39;s office visit but did not require emergency room visit. He mentioned that there were 3 test and one more scheduled. The first one was a common test; the first initial test diagnose Myasthenia gravis. The second test was the ice test since they went on the assumption in their initial thinking it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and in his, doctor&#39;s, opinion it didn&#39;t look right. The test sounds goofy and it is one of the tests, they did to predict how it was going to go. He reported that they placed an ice cube in a cloth on the eye and let cool for 2-3 minutes. The eye lid is raised more than it was before the test and it went back down. This test was done on 16Mar2021. He reported that the did a chest x-ray on 17Mar2021 and looked for enlarge thalamus, he states it was normal. He has a CT scheduled next Wednesday (24Mar2021) to check his thalamus and lungs. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test with unknown results on 17Mar2021, he reported that he is waiting for the results to look for antibodies for Myasthenia gravis; chest x-ray was normal on 17Mar2021, he reported that they did a chest x-ray and looked for enlarge thalamus, he states it was normal; endoscopy with results of no finding on Mar2021, his GI doctor wanted to do an upper and lower endoscopy, so 2 weeks prior to the vaccine he had an upper and lower endoscopy with no finding; and ice test with results of bell&#39;s palsy on 16Mar2021 and in his doctor&#39;s opinion, it didn&#39;t look right. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 51-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 14Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 51 years as single dose. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. Historical v for covid-19 immunisation accine included the first dose of BNT162B2 administered on left arm on 24Mar2021 at age of 51 years for covid-19 immunisation and experienced no issues. Patient reported that after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, he had a fever for 8 days and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 21Apr2021. Patient reported that he was tested for both Covid-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B twice on 19Apr2021 and 21Apr2021 and tested negative for Covid-19 and influenza both times. Patient reported that he had no pre-conditions and that he was feeling great the night before he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 13Apr2021. Patient reported that he was planning to go to work following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 14Apr2021. He began running a low-grade fever (102 degrees) on 14Apr2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and then his temperature flared up to 103.5 degrees on 15Apr2021. Fever: He received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at 10:45 on 14Apr2021 and about 2:00 in afternoon on 14Apr2021 was the first fever that was significant. The last fever he had on 21Apr2021, his temperature was 103.9. He was put on antibiotics for pneumonia. He contacted the on-call nurse for his company. The on-call nurse advised him to see a doctor on Saturday, 17Apr2021.He went to the doctor on Monday, 19Apr2021. The doctor only ran a Covid-19 swab for testing and a flu swab. His doctor did not do blood work and stated that the patientwas experiencing an ill effect of the Covid-19 vaccine and sent the patient home. He went back to the doctor on Wednesday, 21Apr2021. When he went back to the doctor, the staff performed a chest X-ray and ran 4 different blood works to see what the patient had. The second Covid-19 test that he received on 22Apr2021 was performed with both the rapid test and the test that was sent off. Both Covid-19 tests came back negative. SARS test on 22Apr2021 was negative. 508-3 High Sensitivity CRP: One of his numbers that was parts per liter, 3 is considered to be high risk and he had 300 (300&#43;) of whatever it was on 21Apr2021. He went back to the physician and was given another steroid shot an additional prescription. He had been back to the doctor 3 times since then. Fever: His fever was 103 consistently after 15Apr2021. 508-3 High sensitivity CRP: This value showed abnormal. The results said that relative risk was greater than 1 mg/liter and high was greater than 3. 1000 CBC with auto differential on 21Apr2021: The abnormal results were red blood cells measured at 4.38; hematocrit measured at 13.82; MCHC measured at 36.4; Neutrophils measured at 84; Lymphocytes measured at 12; and absolute Lymphocytes measured at 0.57. He wore a Garmin and that it recorded that he received no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights. He didn&#39;t know anything about pneumonia previously and that he had specifically told his physician&#39;s office everything about what he was experiencing. He told his physician about the wheezing in his chest (on 17Apr2021), cough (on 16Apr2021), fever, and chills (on 14Apr2021). His physician told him it was a normal reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine and sent him home on 19Apr2021. He then consulted Google and started to realize that his side effect were very atypical. Wheezing: When he breathed really light, the crackling would continue. If he breathed shallow, the wheezing was audible but if he breathed deeply, it was not. The pneumonia was in the left side of his chest. He was still being treated for the pneumonia. He has his last dose of medication tomorrow, 27Apr2021, and that he was also being released to go back to work tomorrow. Cough: He had a little cough that would then go away. The cough began late Friday, 16Apr2021. It was interesting because it wasn&#39;t a main part of the illness. The cough was just kind of a hacking cough every once in awhile. The cough was not continuous like go and go and go and stop. The cough came, went away for awhile, then came again.The cough being worse was relative. He was coughing more than he did on Wednesday 21Apr2021, Thursday 22Apr2021, and Friday 23Apr2021. The cough was consistent more so at night when he laid down. He would probably say that it was a different feel towards the cough but it was still a cough. The cough was still the same volume but not the same effect. Headache (on 18Apr2021): He had been waking up with headaches in the morning and going to bed with them at night. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, the headache was due to dehydration from the fever and night sweats. Once he got away from the dehydration headaches, the headache got better but he had woken up with a headache the last few days and had a headache at bedtime a few nights in a row. The headache was usually a frontal headache and this morning, 26Apr2021, the headache was toward the back of his head. The headaches last a few hours until he started moving around. On Saturday, 17Apr2021 he experienced a migraine that would not go away. He didn&#39;t usually get migraines. The migraine lasted hours if not for a day and that the headache was something furious. Sunday 18Apr2021 was pretty much the same thing with the headache. Because of the massive fever, he couldn&#39;t eat anything at all (17Apr2021). The headache was mostly due to low blood sugar and dehydration. Appetite: His appetite improved after his second doctor&#39;s appointment on 21Apr2021. The second provider was a lot more straightforward and advised the patient that he needed to start taking care of himself and trying to force himself to eat. He forced himself to eat on 21Apr2021 and by Thursday 22Apr2021, he had a full appetite and was craving food again. Shortness of breath (Apr2021): Patient reported that the shortness of breath was just from being fatigued. Patient reported that he got out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He was unsure when the shortness of breath began because he was moving very little, but that he noticed the shortness of breath on Monday, 19Apr2021 when he got up to go to the doctor.On Friday 16Apr2021 and Saturday 17Apr2021, he had a really good break.On Friday 16Apr2021 from 9 AM to 1 PM, he had no fever and it was like the sun was coming out, then the fever hit really hard. The same thing happened on Saturday, 17Apr2021, but the fever free period lasted maybe a little longer. His fever returned and that the afternoon of Saturday 17Apr2021 was the worst he had been the entire time. On 13Apr2021 to get away from arm soreness, he did a few laps in the pool. On 13Apr2021 he had a new best time on the 100 in freestyle in the pool and that he felt really strong going into 14Apr2021 to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. There was nothing that would have indicated that he had anything going on before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Up until Saturday, 17Apr2021, he had only been taking Motrin and just taking 2 tablets. He had no break in between fevers and chills and was not able to get ahead of the fever with the Motrin. There was a long stretch where the Motrin wasn&#39;t working and his temperature didn&#39;t get below 100 for several days. He tried to cycle acetaminophen in beginning Saturday 17Apr2021 to try to get the acetaminophen in between the Motrin doses.  When he went back to the doctor on 21Apr2021, the provider told him that he could take 3 to 4 Motrin tablets at a time but not to exceed 4 doses per day. He never took more than 3 tablets. Motrin was generic ibuprofen. Night sweats (on 21Apr2021): The last couple of nights have been the same. He had a fan on to keep a little cooler and that it was 61 degrees outside and he felt the night sweats. He had a buckwheat mat that was cool that he put on the floor to stay cooler with the night sweats. Come Thursday, 22Apr2021, he said we&#39;re done with this and he couldn&#39;t sleep from it (Apr2021). Last night, 25Apr2021, he knew that he had night sweats because he was sweating at night and the temperature in the room was 64 degrees. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room. AEs required a visit to Physician Office for fever, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chills. Outcome of events was unknown.

He said he had some pain at the injection site and mild headache in the afternoon; however, around 12 to 1 am in the morning, he was feeling heart palpitation and he felt his muscle twitching from his upper torso which went down to his thigh and no loss of consciousness.  He said he checked his heart rate and it was 70 and he did not have any problems breathing.  He said his heart palpitation felt better after taking some deep breaths.  He said he no longer had heart palpitations or muscle twitching any more.  He denied any other symptoms.   Generally, he appeared well, no facial drooping, awake, alert, oriented, speech clear, and normal gait. (Today)

He had numbing and tingling in his left three fingers (clarified left three fingers as his middle finger, index finger, and ring finger) and numbing and tingling in his toes as well. Concomitant medications included ubidecarenone (COQ-10), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), rosuvastatin and monascus purpureus (RED YEAST RICE). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 52 years old on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. With second dose the patient thought he would be better, but about 12 hours later he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm. He checked his body temperature and he didn&#39;t have a temp. His temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit. He tried to keep himself warm. He got nauseous with it. Basically he looked on line and was having them. Today he started to feel better, but still a little nauseous. He had severe fatigue. He didn&#39;t realize he could go fill out something on the website for CDC. He knew he had wanted the vaccine because he had some severe symptoms when he had COVID. He didn&#39;t want to get COVID again. His hospital frustrates him sometimes. They didn&#39;t put the date on there when he was to come back for the second dose. They didn&#39;t tell him to come back on the 13th. He had to figure the dates from the website and emails. He talked it over with his wife. He came in contact with it every night. He was taking care of people that were critical. He worked in the intensive care unit. Even the people he took care of that didn&#39;t have it, ended up with it. He wore a mask. He used hand sanitizer. He didn&#39;t want to get it again. People were shocked when he got it the first time. He did verify that he got the second dose one day sooner, instead of the three day window. He was sick with the first and was expecting to be more sick with this one. He wanted to give himself an extra day before he had to go back to work. He had a couple of emails where they discussed increasing the window to do it a day sooner. He was going to have to go an hour an half a way to get the second dose and he didn&#39;t want to do that. The patient underwent lab test included height was approximately six two, weight was about 194 lbs on an unspecified date, and body temperature showed 96 degrees Fahrenheit in Jan2021. The outcome of the event he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm, temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit was recovering, for the events he got nauseous with it and he had severe fatigue were not recovered.

The patient could not take Benadryl as he cannot tolerate Benadryl. With Zyterc he does not have secondary effects like he does with Benadryl. The first week after getting the vaccine he only had kind of had localized soreness and pain in the area. He later clarified it was in the area where got the injection, vaccine. He just had pain soreness in that area. Other than that he had no side effects at that time. The third week, initially stated as, about 5-7 days ago he started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before. It was like he had the flu kind of thing, but he did not have a temperature. However, the feeling is in his head. It is like heaviness feeling from the flu in his head. He has been having the heaviness in the head feeling for 4-5 days. He later further clarified and initially clarified the localized pain and soreness was noticed the second day, the day after getting the vaccine. This only lasted a few days.

On Tuesday, yesterday, he went to get blood work done. Blood was drawn but has no results yet. Localized pain and soreness time of onset didn&#39;t remember, stated he may have had a little pain right after getting the vaccine, but it was around 21:00 25Jan2021 he really noticed the soreness and pain.

Peaked at 24 hours after shot. 3.  &#34;Glans/local ache&#39; (lower back/kidneys and testicles) within 8 hours.  Testicle ache stopped with 36 hours after shot.  Kidney/lower back ache still lightly present at 48 hours. 4.  Shaking/Chills.  Started 12 hours after shot.  Went from light to extreme within 30 minutes.  Shaking and shivering uncontrollably.   To the point I would not have been able to dial 911 for help if I had needed.   No matter what I did I could not get warm or stop shaking.  Extreme shaking lasting about 2 hours.  In about 2 more hours shaking subsided and stopped.  So shaking stopped around 16 hours after shot.  Chills continued until around 36 hours after shot. 5.  Cold sweat/Fever.  Sweating starting 11 hours after shot.  Lasting until about 36 hours after shot.  For fever, Unknown how high it was as I was too busy uncontrollably shaking to take my temperature.  Fever remained for about 48 hours in low grade form EXCEPT for hours 11 through 18 after shot - I am sure it was very high due to headache, chills, shaking, etc at that time.  Basically, for most of the 2 days, it felt like the flu.  But for 6 hours, (hours 11 through 17 after receiving the shot), it was the sickest I can recall beings in decades.    Will &#39;click&#39; I have recovered below in item 20.  But not 100% back to normal yet.  90% back to normal would be a good current &#39;level&#39;.  Expect to feel 100% again tomorrow or the next day based on recovery rate.

He is calling because he experienced lymphadenopathy- explains he experienced Lymph node pain/tenderness around his left clavicle. Caller clarified that the injection was on his left side. The pain/tenderness occurred the next day, 27Feb2021 and it was self limiting and it lasted about 5-7 days.

On 12Mar2021, he developed similar pain on the right side, but it was a more intense pain/tenderness and lasted maybe 4 days. He still experiences it, but less frequently. He is not sure if he is describing it correctly. During the afternoon, it gets a bit more tender. He doesn&#39;t feel it in the morning, but by the afternoon he notices the pain/tenderness. He did not know if there were any reports of contralateral lymphadenopathy (lymph node pain).

Sometimes there&#39;s a little pain on the left side still, but not as intense as the right side. The pain is there, it&#39;s not worsening but it is not improving. The patient also reports joint stiffness around neck and shoulder and describes discomfort as ongoing intermittent tenderness.

                                                Fairly rapid onset of excess fatigue, difficulty keeping eyes open associated with oscillating vision, near simultaneous distortion of sound (at the time was watching a show using my phone, and the actors no longer sounded like themselves), sense of subtle disequilibrium, and a sense of intense heat involving my upper abdomen and lower chest, centered around my xiphoid process as if being pressed up against a space heater, the latter symptom was non-painful, perhaps the best example is the feeling one has after receiving intravenous contrast dye for CT imaging although more the &#34;warmth&#34; was more intense. Lasted 90-120 minutes before going to sleep, then gone by morning.

By afternoon of 12 JAN 21 experienced sudden onset loss of bladder control for first time in his life, followed a few hours later by blurry vision, vertigo, motion sickness, emesis and cold sweats that drenched his clothes. Taken to  ER by paramedics, and admitted  for further observation and evaluation for underlying neurologic vs. cardiogenic problems. Given positional treatments by PT for possible otoliths.  Feels much improved on afternoon of 13 JAN 21, but symptoms not fully resolved. Will likely be discharged from hospital on 14 JAN 21 if problems continue to resolve.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

I had a dripping sweat occur at the five to fifteen minute range. There was a flushing sensation during this. After a few minutes, it all abaited. The bandaid was saturated with blood.  My arm was never sore and I had zero symptoms after the initial reaction. I believe this injection was given intravascularly.  I have not been able to find ANY information to address the effectiveness of this route if administration and I seriously fear that I am not covered.

About 10 minutes later, as I was driving home, I had an odd taste in my mouth and my right cheek started to go numb.  I arrived home and started looking for answers (Pfizer information page that lists side effects).  The sensation lasted about an hour or so, then started to subside.  By the time I went to bed, there was just a little tingle at the edge of my cheek bone. Other than being tired and a bit woozy, I feel better today.

                                                1st symptom: Within 30 seconds, ache in arm from elbow to wrist.  Got worse over next few minutes, fairly uncomfortable for about 45 minutes before subsiding slightly (tried to keep moving arm as recommended).  Pain returned when I drove to work and while at my desk.  Lasted for approx 4 more hours.  Injection at 11:15am, pain mostly ended around 9:30pm (except when reaching or extending arm, pain in shoulder now mostly). 2nd symptom: Mild nausea starting about 5 min after injection, while in waiting room.  Passed when laying down at home before work, approx 45 min later..  Started again while driving to work and lasted from about 4pm to 8pm.  Subsided about 10pm.   3rd symptom - feel very fatigued.at typing of this report at 10pm - started about 5pm. So far nothing else - no headache or chills for example.  No pain at all at the actual injection site - now the pain is mostly above it - from the shoulder joint to near the injection site (maybe a couple inches above.) as well as the forearm, all around.   To make coping easier in case the symptoms (arm ache, fatigue, etc) are worse as commonly described from the 2nd dose I put in and was approved for PTO from work for scheduled 2nd date on  March 30th.   Will allow me to rest (avoid being effected at work with the fatigue and an even more achy arm as expected side effects of 2nd dose)

The next day (3/7) the right side of my face was numb and showing symptoms of what doctors later decided was Bells Palsy. on 3/7 I had fatigue and general feeling bad like I had the flu. On Monday 3/8, I was feeling worse and I called the advice nurse who advised I go to the  Emergency room due to right face partial paralysis, numbness, and face drooping. They diagnosed Bells Palsy and prescribed Valtrex and prednosone. From 3/9-12 the right side of my face was numb, droopy and I had ear pain and a lot of fatigue. By Saturday 3/13 I was feeling better and have gradually gotten better through today 3/26. I still have numbness in my right cheek. and occasional tingling in my lips. My doctor has advised me to go ahead and get the second dose of vaccine tomorrow 3/27. Also, during the week of 3/7 - 3/12 I had some dizziness and a general foggy feeling in my head.

A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 (at the age of 54-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient experienced not feeling well, ate a bit but not much, kind of pale, vomiting, trouble in breathing, and agitated on 04Jan2021; body was hyper dried and restless on 05Jan2021; mind just seemed like it was racing on 06Jan2021; and not responsive and he passed away on 06Jan2021 at 10:15 (reported as: around 10:15 AM). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the vaccine on 04Jan2021, after which he started not feeling well. He went right home and went to bed. He woke up and ate a bit but not much and then was kind of pale. The patient then started to vomit, which continued throughout the night. He was having trouble in breathing. Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting. The patient was told he was probably having a reaction to the vaccine, but he was just dried up. The patient continued to vomit throughout the day and then he was very agitated again and would fall asleep for may be 15-20 minutes. When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening. When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn&#39;t breathe, and his mind was racing. The patient&#39;s other brother went to him and he was not responsive, and he passed away on 06Jan2021 around 10:15 AM. It was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of all of the events was unknown; not responsive was not recovered, the patient died on 06Jan2021. The cause of death was unknown (reported as: not known by reporter). An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and has been requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: not responsive and he passed away

Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

He had 2 doses of covid vaccine with no side effect. 15 days later, he had antibody test on 05Feb2021 and the test of IgM and IgG basically were negative. He had no antibodies to the coronavirus. So he was not sure whether or not he got a vaccine that was too old, not taken care of properly, but he had no immune response 15 days after the second dose he should have developed a response, developed antibodies. He was inquiring if that was effective and wanted to know if he should get another antibody test and take another dose of the Pfizer vaccine or get the Moderna vaccine. The patient stated seriousness as it was serious, it did not require hospitalization, he was not ill at least and had been self-isolating very well, but he was thinking long term, he was feeling well, had no problems, no complications related to the vaccine, other than a sore arm with both shots, that&#39;s it, it went smoothly, it was serious, he hoped to have some protection, but was concerned he had none. The patient had sore arm with both shots. The outcome of event antibody test negative was not recovered and event sore arm was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: It was noted that patient had antibody test and the test of IgM and IgG basically were negative. He had no antibodies to the coronavirus.

                                                Within approximately a couple of days from the first of two COVID19 Pfizer injections, I developed a progressive, systemic, neuro/neuro-muscular inflammatory pain response.  The inflammation and pain first manifested in my left wrist and hand, greatly worsening recent symptomology that may have been the start of a carpal tunnel syndrome.  The inflammation and pain then progressed to my right wrist and hand and right shoulder.  Then they progressed to my left shoulder, under my clavicles, my hips,  and my upper lumbar/lower thoracic region of my spine.  Muscle groups tightened and hurt, chief among them my hamstrings and upper back.  All within days.  The inflammation and pain were severe, especially from the early a.m. (3 or 4 in the a.m.) to waking hours.  And the conditions left me nearly debilitated and incapable of sleeping well or performing many ADLs.  Then, on Monday, March 29, 2021, I saw an orthopaedic for the pains in my wrists and hands, and he prescribed me a steroid for a preliminary diagnose of bilateral carpal tunnel.  The inflammation and pain throughout my body decreased considerably after only two doses of the steroids.  That led me to seek a consultation with the rheumatologist.

Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 54 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cholesterol. The patient was diagnosed with BPH a few years back 2016 or 2017 and had a uralist in 2019 and that resolved his issues. The patient had been on no BPH meds and back to normal since that procedure. Co-suspect medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) from an unknown date to 01Apr2021 at 40 mg, 1x/day for blood cholesterol. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced prostate infections, and abdominal discomfort. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced arm pain, and was lightheaded. He described the arm pain as he had deltoid pain but he also had pain like he had been hit from his right pectoral down his arm to about 4-5 inches above his wrist. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, sweat, urinating blood, and dark colored urine. The patient was concerned with the dark urine so he stopped taking atorvastatin, and called his physician who said he didn&#39;t need it anyhow. The patient visited the urologist office and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) as treatment for dark colored urine, urinating blood and prostate infection. On 06Apr2021, the patient experienced leukocytes in urine. Relevant lab data on 06Apr2021 included a urinalysis which resulted in leukocytes and blood &#43;3. The action taken in response to the event dark urine with atorvastatin was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events prostate infection, and abdominal discomfort was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events arm pain, and lightheaded was recovered in 26Mar2021. The outcome of the events couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, and sweat was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of the events urinating blood and dark colored urine was recovered on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the event leukocytes in urine was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the serious events Prostate infection, Blood in urine, and Urine color abnormal are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drugs. Relevant medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may provide a plausible explanation for the events.

Took second dose vaccine 1/20/21.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

They took some blood work, CBC panel were  negative, thyroid test, normal, anaiongap, normal, glucose reading, normal and an EKG normal.  2nd episode 01-21-2021 started 11;45am, that morning when i woke up i felt really strong feelings of sadness and despair.  At 11;45a i was about to eat and i started to feel again brain fog, total body weakness, elevated BP, they took my BP again and it was 144/88 so i went to the ER again. I could not keep my eyes open. They did a EKG again with a CTA and a CT with perfusion both were normal. They gave me fluids, sodium fluids. Agian it was transient my BP slowly went down and went home.  Third episode 01-25-2021 started about 9am,  i was at home did not have access to a BP cup, symptoms were same but less intense, i could feel my heart pounding, brain fog and body aches and this lingered throughout the day. It felt like I had the  flu.  No elevated temperature on all three of my episodes.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.  RADIOLOGY DIAGNOSTIC - CHEST PORTABLE 02/04 2051 *** Report Impression - Status: SIGNED  Entered: 02/04/2021 2059 IMPRESSION: 1.

The patient experienced the following with his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Shot was painful and in about 15 to 20 minutes later everything felt fine. But by the time he and his wife drove out of town, he started to get HOT with the sweats, terrible headache, dizziness and started to lose his vision. He pulled over to let his wife drive and by the time he got out of the car he could barely navigate to the passenger side. They turned around and headed for the hospital, 8 min away, at this time he couldn&#39;t see anything, he was nauseated but knew the hospital was pretty close. During this whole time his heart rate never raced just kept and even beat. His breathing was also just fine. By the time they got into the parking lot his vision was slowly getting better, so they sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes with the air conditioner on as high as it could go. His wife read through the side effects, he was experiencing many on the list. They left without going in. Onset of the events was reported as 12Mar2021 12:45 AM. Treatment was not given for the events. The patient recovered from the event &#34;shot was painful&#34; on 12Mar2021; while recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Mar2021.

It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus.

He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic.

A 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899), via intramuscular route on 17Dec2020 at single dose (dose 1, left deltoid) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included non-smoker. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient was scheduled to take the second dose on 05Jan2021, also reported as 08Jan2021. The patient experienced sore arm for 24 hours afterwards on Dec2020. Patient experienced mild COVID symptoms such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, and tiny bit of shortness of breath on 24Dec2020, but stated he was better now. The patient was positive in the COVID test on 28Dec2020. He wanted to know if it was normal to get COVID after getting the vaccine and if he should get the booster shot if he gets better.  He commented that testing positive for COVID was medically concerning. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow ECMO) or receive a mechanical ventilation. Treatment included over the counter medication. No additional testing was done. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the event sore arm was unknown; cough was not recovered; fever, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, tiny bit of shortness of breath was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number was already obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 virus test positive cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A contactable nurse and contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR), orally from 02Oct2020 at 11 mg, daily for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 19Dec2020, the patient experienced neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare.  In Dec2020, the patient experienced increase in joint pain from his baseline. The physician was aware. The patient was placed on unspecified steroids for the events, neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare which minimized symptoms. While weaning off steroids, the severity of symptoms returned. The patient was instructed by the doctor to stop taking tofacitinib citrate which was stopped on 29Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for tofacitinib citrate was permanently withdrawn on 29Dec2020.  The patient reported slight improvement after stopping tofacitinib citrate.  The outcome of neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare was recovering and of increase in joint pain from his baseline was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, the reported events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors and unlikely that it is related to the suspect product. However due to temporal association with the vaccine, a possible contributory role of vaccine cannot be ruled out. Case will be reevaluated based on additional information during the follow-up.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

About 1.5 hours after injection, in between my pull-up exercises I felt light arrhythmia; his legs were shaking which had never happened before; This is a spontaneous report from a  contactable consumer reporting for himself.  A 56-years-old male patient  received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot # EL0140) vaccine , in the right arm on 05Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation .  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced light arrhythmia  on 05Jan2021 16:30 with outcome of recovered , his legs were shaking which had never happened before on 05Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, had sore arm  on 06Jan2021 with outcome of recovered; felt brain fatigue  on 07Jan2021 with outcome of recovered ,  , felt very hungry before dinner  on 07Jan2021 with outcome of recovered , on 07Jan, after breakfast  felt tired, so took a nap  on 07Jan2021 with outcome of recovered , during the whole day i took three naps  on 07Jan2021 with outcome of recovered.   Course of the event: Between 15-30 min after injection, the patient felt light arrhythmia twice and  tried to do deeper breath to control it. About 1.5 hours after injection, in between his pull-up exercises he felt light arrhythmia 2-3 times, and after doing the third set of pull-ups his legs were shaking which had never happened before.  Next morning the patient  woke up a couple hours later than his normal time. Noting that the night before he went to bed one hour earlier for no reason. When semi-waking up, he had a strong arrhythmia, followed by a couple more light ones. In the past arrhythmia did occur to him when he was very stressed or very tired, but had not have it for a few years.  The patient had sore arm but tolerable. On 07Jan2021, after breakfast the patient suddenly felt tired, so took a nap. During the whole day he took three naps, which he had never done before. No arrhythmia though. The patient felt brain fatigue, but physically no problem. He felt very hungry before dinner, same as the day before, but not in other days.

                                                I did not experience any adverse symptoms with the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with the exception of injection site pain after the first dose that began on day 2 through day 5 or for 3 days.  The first Pfizer-BioNTech dose was received on December 30, 2020, LOT EK5730. I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS on 12/31/20.  Please note that I completed the same pretreatment protocol 1.5 hours prior to dosing with Pfizer-BioNTech of Diphenhydramine 25 mg plus Pepcid 20 mg for both COVID-19 doses.  I elected to complete a self-administered pretreatment protocol due to a shellfish allergy and literature reports of anaphylaxis with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in food allergy recipients.  I did not experience any adverse symptoms on Saturday afternoon after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at 4:45pm on 1/23/21.  On Sunday morning 1/24/21, I awoke feeling &#34;cold.&#34;  I dressed warmly, but the feeling progressed to chills by 3pm.  Malaise ensued around 1pm.  I also experienced injection site pain on the morning of 1/24/21 beginning at 7am.  The pain lasted until 1/25/21.  I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS ON 1/24/21.   I began to feel uncomfortable with malaise and chills at 6:15pm on 1/24/21 and self-administered one dose of OTC Aleve, Naproxen sodium 220mg plus one dose of Benadryl 25 mg.  I began to feel better by 9pm on 1/24/21.  I awoke on 1/25/21 without any symptoms or discomfort with the exception of some injection site pain (2 out of 10 on VAS).  I have been asymptomatic since 1/26/21.

For the Uveitis I went to my eye doctor and started a prednisolone regimen and am still on it. I received the 2nd does (lot EL9264) yesterday on 3 Feb at 09:00am. The mouth ulcers were treated with oral medication-Valtrex. 2nd dose does not seem to have aggravated the above noted reactions. Other symptoms common to the injection are occurring but seem more intense after the 2nd dose (aches, low energy, some minor coughing)

                                                Mild palpitation; faint feeling; Arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 56-year-old male patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, lot number: EL0140, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (vaccine location: right arm) on 05Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: Hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no Covid prior to vaccination. On 05Jan2021, 30 min after injection, felt a mild palpitation-stronger than any previous mild ones but not as strong as the strong one he experienced after the first injection, and he had to close his eyes due to the faint feeling. This was followed by a mild one 3 min later. In the next few days, he had several additional mild to weak palpitations. The strong one that he experienced was 12-14 hours after receiving the first dose, did not show. The patient also experienced arm soreness after the first dose (Jan2021). The patient was not Covid tested post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

                                                On the night of vaccine I had a fever up to 101 degrees, aches and fatigue into the next day.  Two days later I started having diffuse sporadic and intermittent tingling on various parts of my body.  That lasted about 2 days in its greatest severity.  On day 6 post vaccine, I was walking in an airport and developed chest pain, tachycardia, and shortness of breath out of proportion to my level of exertion.  This chest pain, shortness of breath and tachycardia with minimal exertion (a flight of stairs.  A walk to the end of driveway.) has persisted since then.  A cardiac w/u with Echo and  treadmill stress ECHO were negative.  I also have intermittent fatigue, headaches, and a mild &#34;brain fog.&#34;

                                                First injection - only a sore right deltoid (injection site).  Fairly intense but only lasted 24 hours and easily alleviated by Tylenol. Second injection - Ringing in my ears - noticeable starting about 9pm the day of the second injection (3/11/21) and it&#39;s still going strong.  Intensity of ringing has remained constant to date unfortunately.  Headache was minor and on &amp; off starting the night of the injection date and appear to still encounter them but intensity has been low.  Taken Tylenol to alleviate symptom with success.  Soreness at injection site - less intense on second shot than first but it lasted about 48 hours.  The Tylenol I took for the headache seemed to help with the arm pain.  On the day after the injection, my right latissimus dorsi (same side as shot) became sore but only for about 24 hours. Tiredness - didn&#39;t feel the exhaustion until about 9pm on the day of the injection.  Exhaustion/tiredness set in more than expected so very low activity the day after and went to bed several hours earlier than normal.  Still feeling tired but emerging from that as i&#39;m starting to feel more energy come back.

I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

                                                Experienced a delayed reaction to vaccine that occurred at 11 p. m.  Administration was at 8:23 a. m. earlier in the day.  Symptoms began as build up of mucous in back of throat and reflux. Very early the next morning symptoms progressed to near inability to swallow,    Took 50 mg of Benadryl which gave a bit of relief.  Very hard to drink the water and get it down with the two pills.  The symptoms included swollen lips and inside of the mouth swelling.  Went to the emergency room at the Clinic  at 7:30 a. m.   I was given 60 mg of Prednisone, Pepsid to coat the stomach re the steroids. Was sent home with prescription for epi pen, medrol dose pack, Pepsid and Zyrtec.  Symptoms improved except for swelling of lips.  However, on 3/11/21, despite taking the medication, the symptoms worsened in terms of renewed lip swell as well as new symptoms of facial flushing and chest flushing.  Symptoms then abated with medication.  On 3/13/21, symptoms flared again with renewed lip swelling, inside and outside check swelling and outside face and chest flushing.  They they abated again with medication.  On 3/14/21, lip swelling renewed as a symptom.  To date, my lips do not feel right but tingly and bloated and irritated.  Saw an allergist this morning who thinks I am allergic to polyglycol a preservative in the vaccine.

By 3/16/21 some of the swelling had gone down on my left knee.  As of today 3/17/21 I still have some swelling in my left knee and lower leg.

A 57-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Mar2021 at 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gout, neuropathy, high cholesterol and heart disease with 4 heart &#39;stints&#39; and known allergies to dairy. Concomitant medications included colchicine (COLCHICINE), gabapentin (GABAPENTIN), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPRIN). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took and had allergies with Cipro [ciprofloxacin] and Erythromycin.

                                                left arm soreness has continued since first immunization received on 2/14/2021, as well as since 2nd immunization on 3/7/2021. Although mild in most positions, it is painful when I attempt to extend my arm laterally in an upward direction. The discomfort is mild under most circumstances, but is quite painful when, and only when, my arm is extended in the aforementioned manner. It has not required medication, and has not required me to seek medical attention. It has been persistent, and the severity has neither increased nor decreased. I&#39;ve simply adjusted my range of motion to avoid those positions that elicit the pain. I would have expected the pain to gradually lessen, but it is not doing so. I suspect that there may be others experiencing the same side effect, so I want to report it.

Little cramping but not urinating blood for now Drank a lot of water and went away  This more than likely unrelated.

The patient just started on his Vitamin D pill until yesterday. He didn&#39;t know he was lacking Vitamin D until the doctor found out. She wants to know if her husband should go ahead and get the second vaccine tomorrow or should he wait a week and let the Vitamin D pill kick in. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s arm started hurting about 5 or 6 hours later after getting the shot on 23Feb2021. The next day, it felt really bad.

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care.

Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, on 22Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID 19 immunization. Relevant medical history included COVID infection last Apr2020. On the peak of the COVID pandemic he had the COVID infection, he lost the sense of taste and smell, had diarrhea although he did not have fever and did not have coughing. He also has medical history of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome. He was tested for COVID, he was positive 2 times and then they did PET scan, MRI from head to toe. They were looking for tumor, neuroblastoma, what was causing the shaking, the myoclonus, the opsoclonus, the ataxia, they could not find anything. They gave him convalescent plasma and then they gave him immunoglobulin human normal (IVIG) 5 doses and they gave him high dose of steroid to the point that his blood sugar was reaching sky high they have to give him insulin. He was hospitalized 2 times, 3rd time was 2 days and sent home and then it got worst, so he was readmitted for another &#39;3&#39; days. So, he was sent home on clonazepam, it makes him drowsy and he went for physical therapy and slowly after almost after 8 weeks his symptoms disappear, and he was able to go back to work. His symptoms all recovered by the end of May, towards the beginning of Jun2020 he went back for the swab test, it was negative, COVID PCR negative and my antibody was positive. Concomitant medications included clonazepam, metformin and simvastatin. Patient went back to work and have no symptoms until this 07Jan2020. Like almost 3 week or two and half weeks after he received the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Two and half weeks later he started having symptoms like shaking of the hands that I could barely write and yesterday he could barely walk down the stairs. The patient received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Dec2020. Immediately after the vaccination the patient felt that his hands became weak. He ignored it because it went away, like after a minute or so it went away. He went home and nothing happened, except for the soreness of the arm the injection site for 2 days, which really did not bother him. Then this past Thursday, 07Jan2021, he went to the church, he was lightning a candle and his hands started to shake, he can barely light a candle. He was able to do it although his hands were shaking. So, he went home. He ate breakfast, and called his neurologist and he said just to observe and then it went away. On Saturday night (09Jan2021) he noticed that his hands were shaking again when he was typing in the keyboard. He can manage to type but his hands were shaking. He went to sleep and just ignored it. Then yesterday, Sunday he worked again, it became worse, his handwriting was shaking. He was really holding on to the pen to write legibly and then he was in the third floor hospital, elevators did not work. So, he walked down through the stairs, both of his legs were shaking very bad while he was walking down three slides of stairs but he thought he came to the ground so he was able to walk on the flat floor on the street and able to walk home. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Outcome of the event tremor was unknown, while for the other events was unknown. The consumer considered a causal relationship between the events and the vaccine.

This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it&#39;s still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it&#39;s lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can&#39;t think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn&#39;t want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn&#39;t know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node&#39;s reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020. His second dose is scheduled tomorrow (14Jan2021) and wants to know if he can still take it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events myalgia and lymphadenopathy were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tendonitis with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Injection site pain; Arm pretty sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician who reported for himself. A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot #: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 at 09:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included a history of anaphylaxis to latex which predated treatment with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, heart rate control, hypertension and high cholesterol; all from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s medical history was &#34;none&#34; and that the patient had no illness at the time of vaccination. Family medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications included ongoing metoprolol taken for heart rate control taken from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for two years&#34;), ongoing telmisartan taken for hypertension orally from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for two years&#34;) at 1x/day (take once daily by mouth) and ongoing rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR; strength: 40mg) taken for high cholesterol from an unspecified date (&#34;taking for 10 years&#34;) at 40mg, 1x/day. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Dec2020 the patient experienced &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34;. It was reported that &#34;a physician called regarding the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he received the second dose of the vaccine on Thursday and was advised by his medical director to call Pfizer to report his symptoms. He reported that he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine three weeks prior to the second dose. The patient first stated that was about 14Dec2020, but then clarified that per his vaccine card, he received the first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at 0900AM in the left arm. The patient stated that he noticed injection site pain that lasted about two days and his arm was pretty sore. Both events completely resolved before the second dose.&#34; It was reported that the events did not require a visit to the physician or to the ER. It was reported that there were no relevant tests. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34; were both recovered/resolved on 15Jan2021.  The reporter considered that there was reasonable possibility (method of assessment: Global introspection) that the events &#34;injection site pain&#34; and &#34;arm pretty sore&#34; were related to BNT162B2.

                                                No initial symptoms other than sore arm at injection site which lasted for about 23 hours. On January 28 in the middle of the night woke up with pain in left hand. Could not move left hand. Was sleeping on back - not on arm or hand.  No restricted blood-flow.  Massaged hand and it became responsive.  This was followed by burning and tingling sensation in hand.  Hand was cold to touch first day. Burning and tingling and muscle tension increased for first couple days.  Would be intermittent and location varied. Hands and feet most common. Left back scapular area and left pectoral muscle common.  Muscle tightness would cause joint pain without signs of any redness. No temperature. No discoloration. Not as bad in middle of the day. After a few days. When second shot was administered on February 9 at 12:10 AM went home and all sensations stopped for about 12 hours. Took Tylenol with some benefit to diminish but not end symptoms. In past few days have read about taking antihistamines which has often helped.  Symptoms are not as intense as they started out to be, but they continue to linger.  Muscle tightness has largely given way to fluttering sensation or paresthesia and burning is mostly in bottom of left foot only. Any muscle tightness can be rubbed out (massage) for the most part. Occasional joint tightness continues in fingers - crack knuckles and it improves.

                                                Pt reported he got the second COVID vaccine at 8:33 am at the  Center at an event run by Health Clinic. At 10 am he began to feel unwell describing &#34;disorientation&#34; which upon further explanation seems he is describing difficulty with his proprioception, ie not able to tell where his body is in space, and disequilibrium, ie having to stop and hold on to something while walking. This lasted most of the day and subsided by evening. He has continued to have ongoing shorter episodes 3-4 times per day lasting 5-10 minutes. In addition he has noted increasing weakness in his right thigh, particularly when going from sitting to standing and the through swing while walking. He describes these as &#34;paralytic attacks&#34; that occur once or twice per day and last hours. Both symptoms are similar to those he had post CVA in 2019 and greatly improved with PT and home exercises. In addition he has noted fecal urgency and fecal incontinence in the last couple of weeks, he is unsure if this is directly related to the vaccine.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not provided, expiry date May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Jan2021 10:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and apixaban (ELIQUIS, lot number ABA8272S, NDC 0003089421, expiry date Oct2021) film-coated tablet, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to 31Jan2021 at 5 mg, twice daily for cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis. Medical history included: he had tested positive asymptomatically for COVID due to contact contamination on 02Jan2021 or 03Jan2021, blood pressure, and A-fib (atrial fibrillation). Concomitant medication included ongoing metoprolol for blood pressure. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient stated that he got sick after getting the vaccine (on 30Jan2021) and had an important question. He got a fever (31Jan2021) and all that stuff that lasted like a day and a half after getting the vaccine, just like a million other people. But he missed the part about asking a doctor about taking his blood thinner, which he took as normal up through the day that he got the vaccine and the next morning, then he stopped it. The patient clarified that he got the vaccine on Saturday (30Jan2021), stopped the blood thinner on Sunday (31Jan2021), the sickness subsided around Monday (as reported), but he still hasn&#39;t gone back on the blood thinner. He wanted to know when it was safe for him to start taking the blood thinner again, and he needed to know what to do for the second vaccine. The clinical course was as follows: He got the first dose of the vaccine on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 and at 22:00 he started feeling hot through the night. On Sunday, 31Jan2021, he had 103 degree fever, chills, body aches, and a headache. He clarified that he recovered completely by Wednesday, 03Feb2021. He had been on Eliquis for years for A-Fib. He stopped taking it once he got sick after getting the vaccine and went back and read the material and noticed what it said about the blood thinner. He did not go to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. The action taken in response to the events for apixaban was temporarily withdrawn. The outcome of the events was recovered on 03Feb2021.  Follow-up (05Feb2021): This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer based on information received by Pfizer from Bristol-Myers Squibb (manufacturer control number US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-013684), license party for apixaban (ELIQUIS).  This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: #) on 05Feb2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 09Feb2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a patient and describes the occurrence of PYREXIA (103 degree fever), CHILLS, PAIN (bodyaches) and HEADACHE in 58-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) film-coated tablet (batch no. ABA8272S) for Cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included Covid-19 Vaccine injection for COVID-19 immunisation. Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure abnormal. On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (batch no. ABA8272S) (unknown route), 5 milligram twice a day. On 30Jan2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (unknown route) Unknown dose by injection in left arm. On 31Jan2021, an unknown time after starting Eliquis, the patient experienced PYREXIA (103 degree fever), CHILLS, PAIN (bodyaches) and HEADACHE. Eliquis (Unknown) was interrupted due to event. On 03Feb2021, PYREXIA, CHILLS, PAIN and HEADACHE resolved. DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 31Jan2021, Body temperature: 103 degree. For Eliquis (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

                                                I had a single red blotch on my right ankle appear the day after my first vaccination. I did not complete an adverse reaction form for it because I was not sure it was related. When I got my second dose, I did not experience any reaction other than a sore arm until three days later. I developed red blotches/hives on my arms, legs, and torso (front and back).  I took two Benadryl on Sunday morning and two more that night.  They tended to go away and then others would pop up in other locations of my body. The Benadryl did not seem to have any significant affect. I was very itchy for several days. i went to see my doctor on the 5th day since it occurred over the weekend and I had an epi pen if I needed it. It was getting better when I saw her so I didn&#39;t want anything other than a topical, which didn&#39;t come in to the pharmacy until they cleared up. I stopped itching by Monday and they were pretty well gone by Wednesday, which was 7 days later. I took photos of the spots.

Lasted 3 solid, then fever began to drop day 4, but headache persisted along with sweats and violent chill. No real appetite.  Also experienced body ache, but not as bad as other symptoms.  No, or little bowel movement during this time.  On day five (today) urine output is dark, but went 18 hours without Tylenol.  Piot to that i need 2 extra strength Tylenol every 5 hours for 4 days straight.  No nausea or vomiting associated with any of this.  I have extreme fatigue due the extreme headache pain keeping me awake.  Headache on the left and right side of the head, not front or behine the eyes, more over the ears.  Today I just feel wiped out by it all, but much improved.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccines previously, including allergy, flu, shingles and pneumonia.

                                                Right Foot started hurting the night after the vaccine. The next day, it hurt to  walk on it. Mainly around the base of my 2nd and 3rd toes. The next day it hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t walk on it and saw the doctor. A red area had developed on top of my foot at the base on my toes. Doctor though could be Gout but didn&#39;t really look like it and usually that is in the big toes. Plus the timing of this issue and my vaccine were suspect. Had X-ray on that Friday, two days after vaccine and everything looked fine they said. I was prescribed Celebrex  and over the weekend took two per day due to the pain. I stayed in bed all weekend and pain got worse before taking another dose of medicine which helped for a while.  Swelling continued to be about the same or a bit more and the redness moved over to my big toe and then up my foot around towards the right side. Today my right side of foot is really soar now as well and still can&#39;t walk on it and still swollen. Doctor at a urgent care sports medicine location prescribed me Prednisone steroid to see if that helps. But so far 5 days after vaccine and my foot is still swollen, red across the top and so painful it keeps me up at night and I can&#39;t walk on it. I&#39;m hoping the steroids work.

                                                On 3-11-21 at 0930, I developed low grade headache up neck over top left side of head in morning, by 1300 hours I felt very crappy similar to how it feels days after a fever breaks when having the influenza. At bedtime 3-11-21, I had a fever 100.1. At 0100, fever rose to 101.1. At 0500 fever rose to 102.6. During day on 3-12-21, I felt like I had the flu, fever broke mid-morning. on 3-13-21, I felt OK. On 3-15 and 16, I felt like I generally like I  had a flue bug. I felt better days later and then around March 21-24th I&#39;ve had a pretty continuous headache and neck ache which I have not had before the  vaccine. Lack of energy and feeling crappy. Scheduled for second vaccine April 2nd.

Woke of the next day with my post acute syndrome symptoms  much worse than I had prior to shot,  my fatigue in my legs were to the point I could hardly walk, my brain fog and tremors  were much worse, that lasted about 1 day then the next two nights I woke up in the middle of night with severe sweating. I was then felling like I had before the shot. Then about 4 days after receiving the vaccine the post acute syndrome symptoms again were much worse than before. This last for about 2 weeks then gradual worked back the my original feeling of fatigue, brain fog and tremors  that I had prior to vaccine

                                                At 1300 on March 26 I received the shot in my left arm. I went back to work after receiving the vaccine I returned to work. At 1720 I was at home and started itch all over my, arms legs, and stomach. Broke out in a rash on my stomach and chest. At 1830 my tongue was swelling and had a hard time speaking. I call a friend and told her. She told me to take some Benadryl. I did. I then went to bed. My friend came over at about 2100 because she was worried and found me in bed. My breathing was off and she tried to wake me. She called 911 and I was transported to the hospital.  I am now in rehab with undetermined results as to what happened.

                                                I woke at 6:30am on 04/07/2021 in a state of complete confusion and disorientation.  It was a level of disorientation I have never experienced before in my lifetime.  I fainted one time and was having extreme difficulty getting my bearings and walking and was simply in total &#34;mental disarray&#34;.  I was having difficulty producing words, a prolonged stutter, you might say.  I was shaking.  The local paramedics came and I was taken to the local ER.  Because I was having difficulty speaking, the paramedics (and later the physicians) thought I might have had a TIA.  An MRI on 04/07/2021 at 5pm produced a negative result.  So i can only attribute my reaction to the vaccine.  It was very significant, and i thought it made sense to report it.

The patient had COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no other medical history or known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported as none.

And when they are not on fire, they itch so bad, and I have scratched them so much, I have sores and scabs on my arms and legs from scratching a itch I can not reach.  Feels like the itching is under my skin.  Not on top.   1) Pain in ALL my body 2) High temperature - my house is 91 degrees and I&#39;m in a blanket and I&#34;m still cold 3) Even though I&#39;m cold - I sweat a lot 4) Have not been able to eat since I got the vaccine 8 days ago - growing very weak and loosing weight 5) I&#39;m dehydrated - Having trouble keeping liquids down 6) Bad stomach pains - sharp pains 7) Real bad gas and lots of it - Not normal for me 8) My kidneys hurt real bad - Probably clogged and overworked      I spend most of my time on the floor n my back.  Hurts too much to stand and walk   NOTE:  I&#39;m growing weak and very dehydrated.                   Something needs to be done soon !

I had not been able to keep down food in 10 days and for 3 days could not keep down liquids, so I went to the E/R. Pulse was down to 37bpm.  Blood had a high clotting factor as was starting to clot. Every nerve in my body felt like it was being electrified while on Fire at the same time!  Acute pain in my heart - Thought I was having a heart attack. High fever with chills and sweats.  Extreme dehydration.  And my kidneys hurt like hell.  They are taxed working overtime.   I was in such extreme pain, they had to shoot me up with Morphine every 4 hours to get it under control. They had to administer blood thinners to prevent clots.  I&#39;m still on blood thinners thanks to this damn vaccine! I was so dehydrated, they gave me 5 bags of IV Saline, a picture of Ice,  a picture of Water, then a picture of Tea, before I could even urinate.    I got to the E/R just in time before my heart stopped,  or before a clot formed and killed me.  Was in the hospital for 2 days.    I&#39;m home now, but still in pain.  I can&#39;t eat but force myself to drink liquids.  I do know if I will be getting any more vaccines...

A 58-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8734) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:00 at age of 58-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It also stated the patient was one of the most vulnerable against virus so he took the Covid-19 Vaccine. Medical history included ongoing cardiac failure congestive diagnosed probably 10 years ago, ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed probably 20 years ago, ongoing dialysis for 3.5 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing unspecified blood thinner. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t take any blood pressure medications and that she knew the patient took a blood thinner. Caller unable to provide further detail for the patient&#39;s medications as she doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s list of medications with her. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534) injected in left arm in Mar2021 at age of 58-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fatigue after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it was hard to determine the cause of the fatigue because the patient was on dialysis, but that the patient has been more fatigued since he received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was a compromised fellow with a host of pre-existing conditions as far as heart disease, diabetes, and dialysis. Caller was calling in regard to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she was calling to report a bad reaction that her husband, the patient, received on Sunday, 04Apr2021, following his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Approximately 3 hours after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient had a full blown seizure at 15:00 on Sunday, 04Apr2021. Caller reported that she had to call emergency responders following the patient&#39;s seizure. The patient was doing better but the experience with his seizure was quite traumatic. Caller stated that if it was going to happen, it was going to happen to us. About 3 hours after receiving his Covid-19 vaccine on 04Apr2021, the patient became real sluggish and his speech started getting slow before the seizure occurred. Caller reported that the patient made a gradual descent downwards. Caller reported that she swears the patient has not been the same as far as fatigue goes since the patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior. Caller reported that she thought the fatigue was maybe from dialysis. The patient started to get slow just before the seizure, about 2.5 hours after he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was laying down following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s breathing was off. The patient&#39;s breath was heavier. Caller reported that after she noticed the patient&#39;s breathing was off, she asked the patient if he was ok. Caller reported that this is when she noticed that the patient&#39;s speech was really slow and that he was experiencing confusion. The patient has had no more seizure activity. The patient was still being monitored in the hospital. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t remember any of it. It&#39;s hard to say if the patient&#39;s sluggishness and fatigue were ongoing. Caller reported that she couldn&#39;t go see the patient while he was in the hospital but that the patient&#39;s voice sounds much stronger. For Confusion and Speech: Caller reported that the patient seems to be back/ returned to normal. Caller reported that she knew that the patient&#39;s cardiologist went to see the patient. The patient&#39;s cardiologist said that there was nothing that happened to the patient&#39;s heart, that what the patient experienced was not a heart issue, and that the event had no effect on the patient&#39;s heart. The medical staff stated that the seizure the patient experienced was related to a blood pressure drop. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low on 04Apr2021. The patient required a visit to Emergency Room for event seizure, no visit of physician office. Admitted on Sunday, 04Apr2021 for seizure, and still hospitalized. For investigations: Caller reported that the medical staff at the hospital definitely did lab work but she was not sure if any imaging was performed. Caller reported that she has no results available for tests that were performed. The outcome of events confusion and &#34;speech started to get slow&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021380129 same patient, different product(dose)/event

It resolved in two hours. He did have soreness for two days after the vaccine.  He did not have any other symptoms like rashes or difficulty breathing. He could lift his arm.

                                                Had my 2nd COVID vaccination shot at 2 pm on Monday, January 11, 2021.    Next morning - moderate pain in upper left arm/shoulder (place of injection). Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

The day after that the patient was back to being himself. His arm continued to be sore for a total of 5 days. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered.   Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.

On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January.

I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.

Shot Info:  from 3/5 10am to 3/6, no issues, I didn&#39;t even feel the shot, no soreness or other symptoms.  woke up at 2am (first noticed):  Very sore arm, Sore from head to toes, headache, sever chills/shaking, very tired, severe shortness of breath, joints (knees, hips, wrist) constant (not overly severe) pain. Severe symptoms lasted for 24 hours before starting to taper off, felt pretty good by Sunday 3/7 12pm/Noon. My chills were so bad, just getting up to go to the restroom 15 ft away, didn&#39;t know if I could make it back to the bed. Headaches was the last thing to go.

Around 6 pm on the day of the injection I noticed that my taste buds were more sensitive. Following that I became very sluggish. So I went to bed shortly afterwards. The following morning I was still sluggish and there was a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. The feeling of tiredness an no energy started and continued until Wednesday the 3rd of March.  That morning I awaken feeling better. I still have a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. But overall I feel great.

I then received a second dose (Lot # EN6206) on 3/13/21.  Over that weekend the pain in my leg grew worse and the leg began to swell. on 3/15, I went to my primary care physician who said it looked like a blood clot. He sent me to a radiologist for an ultrasound (?) of the leg. After confirming the clot, I went to a local ER. They started me on Eliquis to treat the clot

Pt was recently transitioned from haldol decanoate to clozapine.  Last dose haldol decanoate was on 2/16/21. First dose clozapine 12.5 mg was on 2/24/21. Increased to 12.5 BID the following day. Increased to 25 mg BID on March 2, without reported side effects or other issues.  Pt got his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on March 4, and that night was less engaged with staff, felt feverish. Did not spike a temp per bedside accompaniment who was with him that day. The following day, he barely ate any food and did not get out of bed all day. This continued for the entirety of the weekend - bed bound, turning to look at staff when called but did not engage/respond verbally. He was incontinent of urine over the weekend.  Treated for Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 2/2 clozapine  Uncertain if vaccine contributed to event, but recent case report published relating clozapine toxicity and Pfizer COVID vaccine, so submitting to VAERS for evaluation

Shortly later I had less and less control of the right side of my head, now I can&#39;t  move it. I have since discovered that I have Bell&#39;s Palsy due to the vaccine. I didn&#39;t know what it was until I went to the doctor as this has never happened to me before.

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 06Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pain, high cholesterol, and testosterone low, joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, any place in his body had pain, and doesn&#39;t have good memory, all ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrocodone for pain, ongoing atorvastatin for high cholesterol, ongoing clomiphene citrate for testosterone medication because it was low because of his age, ongoing colecalciferol (Vitamin D), ongoing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), ongoing oxycodone for pain, and unspecified eye medication. He had many different medications that he was taking. Historical vaccines included chicken pox vaccine for immunization and shingles vaccine in Jan2020 for immunization and experienced pain all over. The patient stated that he was a torture survivor and he has been taking pain medication because of him being tortured previously. He was taking medications for the pain, clarified to be hydrocodone and oxycodone. These medications kept his body stable. He was able to sleep and relax. One day after he received his Pfizer COVID vaccine (07Mar2021), he started feeling the pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse but the pain used to be stable with the way he was using his medicines. But now his body was not stable. Any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously because of the damage of torture but now it all came up after the COVID vaccine. Every piece of his body hurt even if he takes his medications. He still had the pain and his body was so weak for about 4 to 5 hours. He used to be able to do his business all day but now after about 3 to 4 hours on his feet he got so tired and he needed to sit. He didn&#39;t know why this happened. He has talked to others that have received COVID vaccines and none have had this kind of reaction like him. He has asked them about it. It was very frustrating to him on an unspecified date. Every month he sees a physician. He would like for Pfizer to contact him with further questions, he can&#39;t understand the pain. This was really killing him especially when the pain goes to his bones. He will keep him up until 3 in the morning and he stays awake on an unspecified date. He then took medicine and he had to wait for 30 minutes for it to start working and then he will be able to sleep. But other than that, the pain jumped. He has had the chicken pox and the shingles vaccines and none did like that. The pain was not going away in his muscles or joints. And now he was getting a headache on an unspecified date, it was really frustrating. He didn&#39;t have good memory from the torture. This morning, when he woke up, he had the pain in his joints and his bones. He didn&#39;t like to use too much medication. He liked to use it only as he needs it. Pain medications are strong. But this COVID vaccine somehow made him need to use more medication and then that caused him to have a headache. His pain should get better with his medications but today, he had pain all over him and he didn&#39;t have any energy to move. He didn&#39;t know how to explain it. The COVID vaccine had really kind of made him weak. Sometimes he drinks a lot of cranberry juice to try and take the vaccine out of his system and it was frustrating because he hasn&#39;t ever been like this. When he had pain like this it reminded him of his torturing and what had happened to him. When the pain came on strong was when it reminded him of that. The medications he was taking were supposed to kill the pain. That was the reason he got so pissed and was trying to ask what was going on. This COVID vaccine is not safe he believed because it has been almost 10 days and it was not helping him. He was still not good. After he got his COVID vaccine on 06Mar2021, he had a little bit of small itching, not much, just a little bit that made him feel not comfortable with it. That was why they kept him for 20 minutes after his vaccine. When he got back home, he was okay, it was nothing serious. But then the day after his COVID vaccine on 07Mar2021, his joints, his muscles and his bones had pain. On 06Mar2021 the itching lasted about 20 minutes. He felt like he was chewing his lip, he was a little uncomfortable and he felt his ribs moving quicker. Nothing happened but he could feel it. He tried to chew his lips a couple of times, but not that much. But after that, he had pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine, 07Mar2021. By the time this vaccine started getting into his body, it was really hurting and getting worse. He had the shingles vaccine and for 1 1/2 to 2 days, he had pain all over and then 2 days after it was all gone, he was back to normal life. The pain was gone. With this COVID vaccine he thought that maybe it was going to be the same but it was not the same and it was hurting. The shingles vaccine was last year in 2020, 3 months before people knew about the coronavirus that was when he got the vaccine for shingles, so maybe Jan2020 was when he had the shingles vaccine. He had no medical conditions or heart and chest problems. No other vaccine he has taken has ever had this type of side effect to him. He took his shingles vaccine in his right arm and the COVID vaccine was in his left. With both he had the same start of having the bad pain. This COVID vaccine goes deeply to the body. The vaccines job is to wake the body. The vaccine&#39;s job is to wake up the body for the virus. The body has to make some kind of soldiers to stand up on the virus and this COVID vaccine had actually made his body weak. After the vaccine is supposed to wake the body, little by little the side effects are supposed to go away. His body was not learning this vaccine. It kept fighting to learn whatever was in this COVID vaccine, his body can&#39;t learn it and fight it. That was the reason his body got weak and the pain has not gone away. His body is still in alert and that&#39;s why the pain was still there. His body was still fighting. Somehow it didn&#39;t match the inside of the body. Maybe for some people that this will happen to, they will be okay but for some they will not be okay. It is not because some people have nothing wrong with them. The patient recovered from itching and discomfort on 06Mar2021; not recovered from any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously/ pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse/ pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine; while outcome of other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 59-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EN6207, Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (at the age of 59 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lupus from 2020 and ongoing, ongoing High Blood Pressure, Spinal Surgeries from 1999, Chronic Pain,Retention water, blood clot issue. The patient previously had tetanus shot. Concomitant medications included losartan potassium; allopurinol; hydroxychloroquine; methocarbamol; morphine sulfate (MS CONTIN); oxycodone; furosemide.  Caller states he is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. Seven days later the dose of vaccine (18Mar2021), patient developed Bell&#39;s Palsy which he has never had before and has never had any other problem with. He has seen an ENT, his pain doctor, and his medical doctor and they all say the Covid vaccine has caused the problem he is having. He was told by his ENT this is very possibly permanent. Emergency Doctors are who he went to because he thought he was having a stroke, because half of his face went numb. He has been to the doctor 10 times in the last 7 days, it has not been fun at all. He didn&#39;t put it together until he saw the ENT, who said Bell&#39;s Palsy is caused from a virus. States he had no idea until he said that, that it could possibly be from the injection. States he has never had Bells Palsy before and it started 8 days after the initial shot. His right eyelid was sticking on his eye and wouldn&#39;t shut and he couldn&#39;t move his face on the left side and he can&#39;t control it at all. Clarifies he couldn&#39;t shut his right eye all of the way. Since then they have told him he needs to tape his eye shut for 12 hours a day to keep from going blind. The thing that bothers him is his eye sight in that eye is getting worse every day even though he uses the cream and tapes it shut. His wife told him even with both eyes shut, it will not completely shut because his lower eyelid is hanging down too far. The ENT told him he needs a hearing test today at 2:00p.m. to see if this is going to be a permanent problem. He is getting ready to go to the ear doctor to find out more. At the same time he developed the Bells Palsy, his blood got really thin and wouldn&#39;t clot which seems really weird. Also on 18MAR2021, his left hand got really swollen and the entire arm bruised and they said the edema in his hand got to the point where his skin was cracking because his blood got so thin that it couldn&#39;t clot at all. He had a blood clot issue in the past. States his arm and hand have improved, he can move his hand again finally. The ENT said that since he has been on Prednisone, for recovery for Bells Palsy, for over a week and gotten worse instead of better, it may be permanent. Prednisone is not working, it has actually gotten worse. Prednisone 10mg for 7 days and to decrease by one tablet every day until gone but states he has gotten worse. Treatments (assessed as for all events): Prednisone. States that it has been two weeks since this happened and the doctor told him the only other option is skull surgery. The bones in his head would be drilled out to make room for the nerves in hopes he would be able to work his mouth again, so not a good thing. Eye cream. He is on disability and his house payment is 3/4 of what he makes, so he can&#39;t take care of the medical bills himself otherwise he wouldn&#39;t worry about it. It is very depressing. His medical doctor said he hadn&#39;t seen any cases of Bell&#39;s Palsy for 2 years, and he has seen 4 in the last week so that doesn&#39;t give him a lot of confidence even though he is still encouraging people to get the vaccine because it is safer than not.He has multiple visits to the ER 3 times between 18MAR2021 and 19MAR2021 within 24 hours; states he was in the ER for hours and hours but no admission. States they did a CT Scan, MRI, CT with contrast and then after that ended up 22 saw ENT who confirmed the fact that Covid Vaccine that gave Bells Palsy and on 22-23 saw his GM again. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None within 4 weeks; states 9 months ago he had a Tetanus Shot. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy, Visual acuity decreased, Eyelid disorder, Orofacial dyskinesia, numbness in face was not recovered; other events was recovering. All events happened on 18Mar2021.

                                                Thumb hurt; Hand swelled up; Elbow was swollen; Intense pain in the elbow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 59-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, at age of 59 years old, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 09:45 (Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure increased from 1995 and ongoing (It is controlled), anxiety (young and suffering from anxiety, has no clue why) and family cancer history. The patient previous received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 19Mar2021 09:45 (Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at age of 59 years old, at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He received the Covid vaccine on 09Apr2021. The following day he later noticed his elbow started bothering him that night, and around midnight it woke him up. He had intense pain in the elbow and tried to tough it out. 4 hours later he was in the ER, it was that bad. When he got there they did an ultrasound and some X-rays. The ultrasound showed his elbow was swollen, and they removed 17cc of fluid. They asked if he had any trauma to his arm and he said absolutely no way. He doesn&#39;t know what to think. He was trying to find someone to help with the issue. On a scale of 1 to 10 the pain was a strong 10. To this day it was still bothering him pretty bad. He coundn&#39;t work because of it. He could hardly straighten it out because it is so sore. It was painful, but not as bad as Saturday(10Apr2021) and Sunday(11Apr2021) morning. On 13Apr2021, his hand swelled up. That&#39;s gone away. His thumb hurt on 14Apr2021 and that had gone away, he just aced that. He put ice on his elbow. His elbow from last night(13Apr2021) to today (14Apr2021) probably had a 30 percent change. It is getting better but it is still sore. He can&#39;t straighten it and he is trying to bend it to work it so it doesn&#39;t get stiff. With the work he does he needs to use his arms. He works in construction. He got the shot on 09Apr2021, and the pain was later in the day. He received his dose around 0945, and at about 1500 to 1530 he noticed his elbow bothering him. Later that night when he went to bed he was uncomfortable and couldn&#39;t sleep. Eventually he did fall asleep and at 0000 he woke up in excruciating pain. He tried to deal with it until 0400 when he went to the ER. His pain is nowhere near what it was. When he tries to straighten it, it is very painful, about a 6. If he bends it back it is much better. If he tries to straighten it the pain level goes up. It is still swelled up a bit. It is hard to say if it has improved, he never really saw it. He went to bed and when he woke up he was in so much pain. He had on his PJs and put on his shoes and left. All he knew was he was in pain. He presumed it was more swollen then, they did the ultrasound and found all that fluid. The pain in his thumb subsided a bit. He took the ice off of it about 30 minutes before this phone call, so about 45 minutes ago. It feels a little better. At least one part of the puzzle is solved. He noticed it at about 0730 this morning. He had an ultrasound on 11Apr2021. He had 3 to 4 X-rays on 11Apr2021. Outcome for events was not recovered. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8732) at the age of 59-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Mar2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. He has no known allergies and has COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, rosuvastatin, oxybutynin, and tamsulosin. There were no other vaccines in four weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he was having some wild effects from the vaccine and did not know what to do. On 26Mar2021 at 15:00, he was having neuropathy like effects. His hands, arms, legs, and feet were experiencing pain and burning sensations, they were burning like nerve damage; he also has a little burning sensation in his nose and cheeks. He has never had this before. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. He was also having some weird sensations in his calf muscles, these sensations started within the past week and a half (Apr2021) which prompted physician office visit. The physician placed him on gabapentin 100 mg to start from 12Apr2021, but it was not enough, it was titrated up to 300 mg, three times a day and he is scheduled to see specialist soon. The patient mentioned that this vaccine has ruined his health. He also went to an urgent care center because his leg was bothering him, it was swelling on an unspecified date in 2021; he thought he had a blood clot; they did some kind of test where they looked at the leg and did not find anything. He didn&#39;t have a particular question. He would just like to talk to someone to see if this was going on with anyone else, if it will go away, or if this was permanent problem he will have. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. He received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Apr2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The outcome of the events was not recovered.
