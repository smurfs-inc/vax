                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

                                                Double Covid Pneumonia; feeling tired; weak; doctors were concerned that the Covid vaccine had taxed his immune system; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient; a direct care staff for a group home).  A 60-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: 613247, expiration date: May2021), intramuscularly to the left arm on 21Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization. He was given the vaccine at work. It&#39;s a group home facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure, and positive for the covid virus from 09Jan2021 to an unknown date. Concomitant medication included benazepril from 22Jan2021 and ongoing for high blood pressure. He saw a doctor on 22Jan2021 and he prescribed Benazepril; it was started on 22Jan2021. The patient previously received a flu vaccine on Sep2020 for immunization. The patient called about the Covid vaccine. He reported that on 09Jan2021, he was positive for the COVID virus. He was then cleared on 16Jan2021 to go to work. His work then offered the COVID vaccine on 21Jan2021 and he got it. Then on 29Jan2021, he was diagnosed with Double Covid Pneumonia. His doctors were concerned that the Covid vaccine had taxed his immune system. The patient was a direct care staff for a group home. He cares for adults that are developmentally challenged. He has a CPR license. The patient confirmed that he received his first dose of the vaccine on 21Jan2021. He started feeling tired and weak about evening of 22Jan2021. He then started feeling out of breath Wednesday 27Jan2021, 28Jan2021 Thursday, and Friday 29Jan2021. He thought maybe he might be having a normal side effect. He stated that the Double Covid Pneumonia was detected on the X-ray that took place on the 29Jan2021. He is scheduled for second dose on 11Feb2021. The patient stated that the weakness was horrible. They gave him antibiotics; he was starting to recover. He was off of work till Saturday due to the pneumonia. He doesn&#39;t know if he will be getting the second dose. The patient was prescribed antibiotic Cefuroxime Axetil 500mg 1 tablet by mouth twice a day for 7 days, antibiotic Doxycycline Monohydrate 100mg 1 tablet by mouth twice a day 7 days, a Steroid Prednisone 20mg 2 tablets by mouth daily at same time in morning for 5 days, and a breather Albuterol HFA 90mcg/att inhale 2 puffs by mouth every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath, wheezing, or cough. It was reported that they did a Covid Nasal Swab Test on 09Jan2021, then on that Sunday or Monday he got positive result, and by that time he had fatigue. After he got the vaccine, he went back to work. After the vaccine, it was a big surprise about the double Covid pneumonia, and they think it was taxing the immune system. He has had no issues with vaccines in the past. He had a Flu vaccine recently and there was no problem, that was Sep2020. He wants to know should he get the second dose.The outcome of the events double Covid pneumonia and &#34;doctors were concerned that the Covid vaccine had taxed his immune system&#34;  was unknown. Regarding his double Covid pneumonia, the doctor said his O2 level will determine how he is doing. They will also do another lung X-ray. The doctor said the antibiotic should take care of it. The doctor did warn him that things could get worse. They said he can possibly go back to work on 06Feb2021, but this is not certain at the moment; it could change.

                                                Few days after receiving the 1st dose, developed tingling paresthesia in both hands. He received his second vaccination  despite the symptoms.  Symptoms continued to progress to his feet, and also developed weakness, particularly in his legs.  Also had some weakness in arm but more so on the left side.  He had difficulty climbing ladder when deer hunting due to weakness in his thighs/legs.  He ended up falling in his home on Jan 17, 2021 as well, which caused significant hip pain.  Had a neurosurgical evaluation- finding lumbar disease L3-4 requiring fusion.  Following surgery, paresthesia and weakness persisted and  actually worsened, , developed uncontrolled twitching in both thighs.  Further developed loss of function in his L-hand.  MRI revealed transverse myelitis.  Symptoms have improved with corticosteroid therapy.  Patient was hospitalized due to these symptoms for two days, discharged on corticosteroids.

Then starting on the 3rd day until present, I feel extremely light-headed and unsteady with a persistent severe headache.  Almost feels like there is pressure in my head for lack of a better description. I feel feverish as well but do not have a fever.  I have difficulty maintaining balance on my feet so it is difficult to walk.   I did seek medical attention yet since I live alone and do not feel comfortable to drive. Although the symptoms are difficult, I also don&#39;t consider them an emergency to warrant calling an ambulance.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

                                                High fever; Vomiting; Severe fatigue; Weakness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient himself).  This 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL1442), via intramuscular, on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 61-year-old. Vaccine location was deltoid left. The subject did not have a relevant medical history and concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021, the patient developed high fever, vomiting, severe fatigue and weakness. He did not experience anaphylaxis. The events were considered serious as medically significant. The patient stated that side effects mentioned lasted 3 hours and he felt much better now. However, the final clinical outcome was unknown. The patient is not sure if he should get the shot again in 3 weeks since he was really sick.  The reporting physician considered the events &#39;high fever&#39;, &#39;vomiting&#39;, &#39;severe fatigue&#39; and &#39;weakness&#39; related to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, vomiting, fatigue and asthenia cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown. Outcome of the events dizziness, &#34;feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his brain wanted to pop out of his head/ his brain wanted to swell up&#34;, felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy, and fever was reported as recovering.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded. The events are known adverse event of the product.

A 62-year-old male patient received NT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL01-40), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Dec2020 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Anatomical Location provided as Left deltoid. Medical history provided as none. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). Physician stated, he got his Pfizer vaccine on last Sunday on 20Dec2020 around 9:30 there was usual soreness at the site of injection on 20Dec2020, which was there but no problem. But Monday (21Dec2020) after his vaccine that was Sunday he had and Monday night on 21Dec2020 he had chills he thought these were all just the reaction to the vaccine. Next day on 22Dec2020 he went into work he had mild body ache at work, at about 3:30 he felt a little sick and he got his temperature about 100.2, get home rested, next day on 23Dec2020 he worked from home, did not go so for next four days (from 24Dec2020 to 27Dec2020) he rested at home but his chills and body ache are not going away. They were there, they come and go, he took Tylenol, it went he have mild sore throat, cough on Dec2020. Today on 27Dec2020, the patient just took the temperature 100.7. For Causality assessment: Physician stated, &#34;he didn&#39;t know, he was just trying to find out to get to bottom of it. Is it really COVID infection or is it due to side effects as from what he read the reaction shouldn&#39;t really last long. It may last probably 3-4 days but this has gone beyond that so he was little concerned and the fever that he had was 7 days after the vaccine.&#34; The patient still had chills and body ache which he means they were not going away and now mild fever. When probed for the outcome of, Physician stated, &#34;They are persistent you know some day he had one day which was good but after that in the afternoon in the evening he felt the same thing. Fortunately, he was off for four days it didn&#39;t really have much problem, physically it was persistent has not gone away.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, had mild body ache, felt a little sick, cough, fever, mild sore throat. The outcome of events chills, mild body ache was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                Intense pain to R foot within 12 hours; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 10:30 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, Penicillin allergy.  The patient experienced intense pain to R foot within 12 hours on 30Dec2020 01:30 with outcome of recovered with sequelae. Treatment received for the adverse event included: MRI, Ultrasound, Interventional radiology. The patient was hospitalized for intense pain to R foot within 12 hours for 9 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Interventional radiology, magnetic resonance imaging, Nasal Swab test: negative, ultrasound scan.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 62-year-old male patient had medical history included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular accident.  The reported intense pain to R foot was more likely due to intercurrent condition/disease, and less likely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information, including MRI and Ultrasound findings and Interventional radiology details, become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 25Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing urinary incontinence (use of medication that does not make him run to the bathroom and helps him hold his urine), ongoing acne, drowsy, and ongoing flow of urine or weak bladder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included fesoterodine fumarate (TOVIAZ; Expiration Date: 04Dec2021) (about 2 weeks prior to getting the COVID-19 vaccine) for urinary incontinence, doxycycline (Expiration Date: 26Nov2021; makes him drowsy) for acne, and tamsulosin (Expiration Date: 12Nov2021) for flow of urine or weak bladder; all from Jan2021 and ongoing. The patient does not take any of these medications while driving. The patient took his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 25Jan2021 (Monday). The patient had been experiencing dizziness which started a few days after getting the vaccine (Jan2021). The patient was supposed to work from Tuesday to Friday, but he did not go into work on Wednesday. The patient was unsure of the specific day the dizziness started. The patient did have allergies (unspecified date), but when he called in his doctor, he sent him a medication for allergies, meclizine (Expiration Date: 28Jan2022). Normally, the medication takes a couple days to make him feel better. After he took meclizine for dizziness, he feels better. The patient notices the dizziness when he is up and moving around. The patient can tell something is off, like his equilibrium is off in Jan2021. It may not be due to the shot, but looking at the paper it says tiredness, which he has been feeling fatigued (also started a few days after the vaccine, but he is unsure specifically what day) and dizziness, which he has in Jan2021. The medication he is taking (meclizine), can also do the same thing, but never for this long. When he takes it, it normally makes him feel better after a few days. The patient has sinus problems as well on an unspecified date, but never lasting this long. The patient had not started feeling better since taking the medication, meclizine (as reported). The patient also said that meclizine could be causing the fatigue because it does make his drowsy and he just sleeps when he takes it - he cannot take it when he drives. The patient would go back for the second dose on 15Feb2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Dizziness when he is up and moving around&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Allergies&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

A 63-years-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Dec2020 14:40, at a single dose for Covid 19. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has no prior vaccinations -within 4 weeks. The patient is an EEG technician. On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine. He mentioned that he was tested for COVID 19 on 18Dec2020 and the result was inconclusive. He went again 23Dec2020 they called him on 25Dec2020 and informed he was positive per the PCR test. He treated himself with 500mg acetaminophen (UPC 0904672059; lot OBE2896 and expiration Oct2021) and azithromycin Z-Pack (NDC 65862-641-69; Lot ZYSA20012-A; and expiration date Mar2022). The sample of the product is not available to be returned. Predisposing factor was that the patient&#39;s wife was at home and was sick too at the same time. She was tested Sunday with no results yet. The outcome of the events of fever recovered on 28Dec2020, sluggishness recovered on 29Dec2020, pain all over the body was recovered on 02Jan2021; running to the bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine and heart pounding were recovered on 24Dec2020, weight loss was not recovered, and for other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (4 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / SARS-CoV-2 test positive) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded

Increase in metabolism leading to being warm all the time ( no sweating).  Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

                                                soreness in left arm; feeling kind of achy; was wanting to run a fever/Very high fever in excess of 102 degrees Fahrenheit; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose on the left arm for vaccination. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism. Concomitant medication include levothyroxine (manufacturer unknown) from an unspecified date probably 2-3 years ago and ongoing for hypothyroidism. The patient reported that the first dose was administered of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 04Jan2021. He had onset of soreness in left arm that day, 14Jan2021 which he recovered completely from by 05Jan2021. He stated that starting maybe 05Jan2021 or 06Jan2021, he had onset of feeling kind of achy and like he was wanting to run a fever. Starting 08Jan2021, he started running a very high fever in excess of 102 degrees Fahrenheit which has been ongoing and persistent since then. He has been taking Tylenol every 6 hours to try to control the high fever but the high fever is just not going away. He was wondering if there is anything he can do because his primary care physician (PCP) can&#39;t really help him at the clinic; He was wondering if Pfizer is familiar with this reaction and if there are any recommendations regarding them. He has taken Tylenol to help, but it is not making it go away. He wanted to know if steroids could be used to counteract this side effect. He added that he is supposed to get the second dose 25Jan2021 but he does not plan to get the second dose, at this point he does not want to do that. He was administered the vaccine because his mother lives in an assisted living facility where the vaccine was offered to residents; and because he acts as a sitter at the facility it was offered to him. On 11Jan2021 he went to Urgent Care for these events, and was given a Rapid COVID-19 Test which had negative result. The outcome of the event soreness in left arm was recovered on 05Jan2021, the outcome of the event was wanting to run a fever/very high fever in excess of 102 degrees fahrenheit was not recovered and the outcome of the event feeling kind of achy was unknown.

He&#39;s reporting adverse events and would like to know: If he takes Tylenol to treat his symptoms, would it decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine or not. Also, if he were to go for a COVID-19 viral test, would the fact that he was received the vaccine interact with the test and cause a false positive result or not. Patient was reporting that yesterday, day 4, he started with body aches, headache, and &#34;when he got in bed, he had chills and shivers real bad, little chilly&#34; so possibly a mild fever.

He also states he has a history of asthma and has been hypervigilant about avoiding COVID infections. Caller, reporting on the COVID vaccine and who explains that he got the first shot on Monday and he had a mildly sore arm- this lasted 2-3 days, no big deal. Then 5 days later he had really bad body aches and a headache. He went to bed cause he was feeling worse but before going to bed he noticed he had shivers really bad, uncontrollably almost which lasted over an hour. He presume they are fairly normal side effects but wants to confirm this could happen after five days. Also, he was told not to take Aspirin or Tylenol before getting the vaccine because it could affect the efficacy, but he wants to know could he take a Tylenol now 5 days later for the headache and body aches. He was better now than he was doing. Caller clarified the event was 4 days after the shot, the shot was Monday and events started Thursday. On Thursday evening, 11Feb2021, was when he had the bad body aches, headache, and shivers. At this point he still has the headache and body ache. He felt like, last night, he had a fever, but he didn&#39;t check it. At the same time, he had the chill and the shivers. Those feelings were resolved by this morning.

By 10:30pm, I began having flu like symptoms, (aches, low grade fever, sinus symptoms) took another acetaminophen 1 GM.  At 11:00 pm, developed severe rigors that lasted for approximately 2 hours. I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

                                                64-year-old male who presented to the clinic with complaints of left-sided weakness on his face. He stated when he woke up this morning he noticed that the left side of his mouth drooped and that he could not close his left eye all the way. Yesterday he felt fine. Today he went to work. Patient stated that on 12/18 he got the COVID vaccine. It was on a Friday. The following day he had a headache and he felt flu-like. He stated that those symptoms resolved quickly. He then had the facial weakness today (11 days after the vacciantion). He has not had any fever, sweats, or chills. Patient stated that he had called ask a nurse, and he was advised to hang up and call 911 and go to the emergency room. However, he stated he was an EMT and did not feel that was necessary. He denies headache. He has not had any vision change. He has been eating and drinking well without any difficulty.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General appearance - patient was not in any distress. He was conversant, pleasant and appropriate. HEENT - normal conjunctivae and lids. Sclerae anicteric. Pupils equal and reactive to light. Patient was not able to close his left eyelid. Normal ear canals. TMs are pearly gray with bright light reflex. Neck - supple. No lymphadenopathy. Skin - pink, warm and dry. Neuro - alert and oriented. Deep tendon reflexes 2&#43; upper and lower extremities with no focal weakness. Normal range of motion. Patient can raise his right eyebrow. Could not raise his left eyebrow. There was impaired eyelid closure on the left; tight closure on the right. Smiling of the face revealed lateralization to the right side. When frowning, he had upper and lower facial paralysis on the left with flattening of the forehead. The patient could not tighten the left side of his mouth.   ASSESSMENT: Bell&#39;s palsy.   PLAN: Discussed pathophysiology of Bell&#39;s palsy. Advised patient I recommended him to call the number that he got with the information when he received his COVID vaccine. Advised patient that I could not definitively correlate the Bell&#39;s palsy with the COVID immunization, but that he can call the number he has to let them know of his symptoms. Discussed treatment options. Since patient woke up with his symptoms this morning, I advised patient that he would have hopefully the best outcome because he would be able to get on the steroid and antiviral soon after developing the symptoms. He is to wear an eye patch to prevent corneal drying or abrasion of the left eye at night. Using Lacri-Lube at night before placing the eye patch and then following up by using artificial tears during the day.   Patient was placed on prednisone 60 mg once a day for 1 week to be taken with food. Valtrex 1,000 mg 3 times a day for 1 week.   Side effects of medication discussed. Handouts were provided. He will follow up with PCP if any changes or concerns. Advised patient that it may take up to 3 weeks before all his symptoms have resolved

A 64-year-old male patient reported received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK4176  and expiry date: Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 08:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history bypass surgery (10.5 years ago, in June it will be 11 years ago) and hard of hearing. Patient said he used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but right now he is 5&#39;6&#34; or 5&#39;5&#34;. He says that change in his height happened before he got the vaccine, that is effects of being short. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) and simvastatin. It was reported that the patient had been healthy all his life, he doesn&#39;t have any medical conditions which could have contributed to side effects.

The patient got the vaccination, the first one (BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization, on unspecified date) he did not have anything happen, no side effects or nothing. It was as if he didn&#39;t receive any vaccine. The second dose he received it at 8:45 AM on Sunday (10Jan2021) and Sunday night he began experiencing tiredness and then chills, fever, generalized aches and could hardly sleep through the night. It was reported as the worst night in his life and then, fortunately during the day on Monday, gradually, the intensity and severity of the symptoms began to subside but he was not able to do any of his normal functions. Then last night Monday night (11Jan2021) he slept well and today on Tuesday (12Jan2021) he was okay, this morning everything was fine. On Tuesday night he took Acetaminophen for pain, he clarified that was Sunday night after he had gotten the vaccine he took Acetaminophen and he still had the problems then Monday night he thought it would be the same so he put the medicine next to the bed on the night stand but he did not need to take it. He slept and woke up this morning and his back to work. Now it is like nothing has happened. He has recovered completely from all effects.

                                                occipital neuralgia; left-side Bells Palsy; bilateral headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (Lot/batch number and Expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration at right deltoid on 21Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included low high density lipoprotein (HDL). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (longer than 4 weeks ago, and he did not have any reaction), pravastatin for low HDL. Reported 2 days ago (02Jan2021) he developed a bilateral headache. He stated he was asymptomatic until then. He said he now has Bells Palsy on 02Jan2021, clarified he has left-side Bells Palsy. He said it is unknown to him if the bilateral headache and Bells Palsy are related to taking the COVID-19 Vaccine. He stated he started wearing a N95 mask for the past 2 weeks. He said the N95 mask is very tight on the back of his head. He said he believes he is experiencing occipital neuralgia caused by wearing the N95 mask. He said studies show that the N95 mask can cause Bells Palsy, and the N95 mask maybe a confounding factor. He stated he doesn&#39;t have any further information on the N95 mask he was using. Initially he had a severe headache and administered to himself a sphenopalatine block of Lidocaine 1% in his nose. He stated being an ER doctor, he knows how to administer the sphenopalatine block to a patient. He went to the ER on 03Jan2021 to make sure he did not have a tumor or a stroke. He said the hospital performed a CT of his head, a MRA, labs, and a COVID-19 test (clarified as a PCR COVID-19 test) with a full viral count. He said all the tests were negative. His wife noticed his Bells Palsy yesterday, 03Jan2021. He said he thinks the Bells Palsy started the night before on 02Jan2021. He said he noticed on the night of 02Jan2021 when he was brushing his teeth, he hit a tooth on that side (clarified as left side) of his mouth with his tooth brush. He hasn&#39;t started taking steroids yet, but will be starting steroids real soon. He clarified his doctor prescribed a Medrol dose pack and Valtrex for the Bells Palsy. He stated he has not started the Medrol dose pack and Valtrex. He is ordering Lidocaine 1% viscous for himself, so he can do an internasal sphenopalatine block on himself. He does not know if the bilateral headache and Bells Palsy were caused by taking the COVID-19 Vaccine. The events required Emergency Room visit. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered,  Headache was recovering, Occipital neuralgia was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162b2 and the onset of Bell&#39;s palsy/Headache might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

Medical history included Covid-19: he tested positive for COVID and received the monoclonal antibody, bamlanivimab on 13Dec2020; other unspecified health conditions which might make him high risk. The patient previously received monoclonal antibody 17-1a, bamlanivimab on 13Dec2020. For Covid-19. The patient received other unspecified medications in two weeks. On 28Dec2020 21:00, 3 hours after vaccination, he was feeling bad with flu-like symptoms, nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue and diarrhea. No treatment received. Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.  His colleague now knows he should have waited 90 days after the antibody but reporter was wondering if there was information. Since there probably is no information, this is a unique situation and reporter wondered if Pfizer wants him to run any particular tests or send in some blood to Pfizer for testing to further medical knowledge on giving the vaccine within 90 days of the antibodies.

I was shivering and chattering on the walk out to the car (it was 30 degrees outside). When I got home, even though it was New Year&#39;s Eve, I put a light jacket on and sat in my cozy chair most of the evening, celebrated New Year&#39;s with the family, then I had to put on flannel pajamas in order to be warm enough to sleep. I usually don&#39;t have to wear pajamas to bed. And for most of New Year&#39;s Day I kept the pajamas on and a light jacket and I was in my chair most of the day trying not to shiver. The shivering finally stopped late on the First, about 54 hours post-injection. And over the weekend the pain in my arm slowly went away, and by now, one week post-injection, I feel no pain in my arm at all.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

A 66-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 12Jan2021 09:15 at single dose in the left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Medical history included prostate cancer from 3 years. Having aches and his back bothering him predates taking the vaccine. A while ago he blew out his knee and his shoulder and three years ago he started having trouble with his back. Family Medical History: heart disease.There were no concomitant medications. He had the flu vaccine from the VA and it can be a little bit of a thing but the last one it ached, made his shoulder worse; the ache lasted six months but it might have been the way it was administered. He has no product or information to provide NDC, lot or expiration date for the flu vaccine he received about two years ago. Mentions he swore off the flu vaccine after that. He was at the VA yesterday for some other business and they told him the shot was available to him so he had it. He is planning to get the second dose on 02Feb2021. He used to take blood thinners and he imagines, like with the blood thinners, that they wouldn&#39;t want him to stack Tylenol on top of the vaccine. He has a few aches and his back is bothering him; which is normal for him; but he would like to know if he can take Tylenol for his back. He noticed some soreness in his arm, a little, when he got home two or three hours later. His sister said to rub it to disperse the medication, so he did. Adds it is not a big deal. Recently he has not been sleeping well; which is also normal for him; so today he slept in; he may have slept too long on his back but his back is aching and he wanted to take some Tylenol for his back. The patient experienced some soreness in his arm on 12Jan2021 with outcome of recovering , back ache on 13Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Treatment received for the event. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Possible Bells Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 66-years-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date: unknown), intramuscular on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 Immunization. Medical history included hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, essential hypertension, obesity, hyperuricemia, iron deficiency anemia, type 2 DM and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besylate (AMLODIPINE BESYLATE), glimepiride (AMARYL [GLIMEPIRIDE]), levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM), metformin (METFORMIN), losartan potassium (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM), ascorbic acid, calcium, minerals NOS, retinol, tocopheryl acetate, vitamin B NOS, vitamins NOS, zinc (CENTRUM SILVER [ASCORBIC ACID; CALCIUM; MINERALS NOS; RETINOL; TOCOPHERYL ACETATE; VITAMIN B NOS; VITAMINS NOS; ZINC]), sucralfate (SUCRALFATE), glimepiride (GLIMEPIRIDE), furosemide (FUROSEMIDE), atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]), pantoprazole sodium (PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM), cyclobenzaprine (CYCLOBENZAPRINE), cholestyramine (CHOLESTYRAMINE). Other vaccine in four weeks included the first dose of influenza vaccine, intramuscular on the left deltoid, on 22Dec2020, lot number: UJ475AA. The patient has no COVID prior vaccination and had not tested post vaccination. The patient experienced possible Bell&#39;s palsy on 14Jan2021. Treatment for the event was unknown. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had not recovered from the event.     Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Symptoms have mostly resolved, he is not always cooperative so subtle weakness is difficult to detect. He was hospitalizaed, started on ASA &amp; increased BP meds, and returned to his home, where he has resided for several years.

                                                On 02/12/2021 around 11:00am I was assigned to have Covid 19 shot at the table#6. At that time I saw the Vaccine was already in the syringe which was in the plastic bag with zipper. Ten days after the shot I felt well, no pain nor swell on my left shoulder. But in the morning of 02/23/2021 after waking up I started to feel hurt to my left arm and the pain was transmitted to the left of my back (left lung). During these 3 days 23,24,25 my pain reached the maximum intensity 10/10 even I took 3 times a day Ibuprofen which was each time 2x200mg. On 02/26/2021 I went to Hospital in the Emergency Unit and after diagnosis the Doctors found that I had 3 heart arteries clog-up. How can I be sure that the liquid in the syringe is the Pfizer Vaccine or something else? I used to see the TVs broadcast on the Covid 19 shot that the nurse inserts the syringe in the small Pzifer bottle, suck the Vaccine into syringe and inject  the vaccine into the shoulder of the patient. Can CDC require that all Covid 19 providers show the vaccine to all patients before the shot? In 2017 I had an Angiogram and my 3 bypasses were not clogged why they are all clogged now? I don&#39;t change my every day diet and I&#39;m very careful with eating fat, cholesterol and salt in my everyday food.

                                                I had the Pfizer vaccine in my left arm on Jan. 23rd. I had no side effects at the time, other than a sore arm, as with any shot. However, two days later I lost all hearing in my left ear. I had no history of ear infections or other ear or hearing problems, except for wax buildup two or three times. On Jan. 26th, I saw an ENT. To my dismay, there was no wax. He prescribed the standard treatment of Prednisone for Sudden Idiopathic Hearing Loss. No change after the first round, so I had a second round, and also had the series of three ear injections with Dexamethasone. Had an MRI, as well, which was normal. A couple of weeks into all this, I began to have a bit of sound-generated static in my ear, and this continues today. (Fortunately, I?ve only had the most minor of tinnitus in that ear, and even it is pretty much gone now.)

The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. There were no concomitant medications nor medical history. He did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No history of any other vaccines or events. He got his vaccine on Saturday(02Jan2021) at 1:30pm(13:30) and by 5:30pm(17:30) had very sore arms/arm pain, at 7:30pm(19:30) he had chills off and on and was sweating. He woke up soaking wet and did that on Sunday, but was feeling a little better today. He also experienced body aches and fever in Jan2021. Today is testing day at his work and he tested positive for COVID virus on 05Jan2021. Not sure if it&#39;s a coincidence. Again, he got the shot and then started having all these symptoms at 5:30 and 7:30. Now they are both on quarantine for the 10-14 days. He wanted to see if it&#39;s possible to test positive for the virus after getting the shot or is it just a coincidence. He also had some muscle aches in Jan2021. Last night (04Jan2021), he woke up again sweating, but not like on Saturday, but he got really warm and started to sweat a little, and on Sunday(03Jan2021) he was cold all day and had a tiny cough, but it wasn&#39;t significant. Ever so often she would hear him cough. All of a sudden patient would wake up sweating. Again, Saturday he soaked everything. There was no Emergency Room nor Physician Office. Outcome of Very sore arms, sweating was recovering, of pain and fever was unknown, of other events was not recovered.    Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

                                                SUMMARY Two weeks after first vaccine: uncontrollable shaking throughout body, followed by chills, then entire body ache and fever.  The first 12 hours were the worst, but after 36 hours all symptoms were gone.   DETAIL The Feb 3, 2021 First vaccine - Phizer Feb 18, 2021      5:00 pm suddenly came down with shaking throughout my body and then chills.        6:00 pm shaking subsided       7:00 pm entire body aches from head to feet      Later in evening - fever throughout body Feb 19, 2021 feeling better, but still muscle and joint pain throughout body.  Some slight fever.  No appetite, but can smell chicken broth.  February 20, 2021 feeling better but tired      10:00 am COVID test at pharmacy.      Noon ate peanut butter and crackers      2:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      6:30 pm ate full Mexican dinner  February 21, 2021 feeling good with a good appetite.  NO SYMPTOMS.       9:30 am breakfast      1:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      1:30 pm lunch REFLECTION: During entire time, no difficulty breathing or coughing.  And the other symptoms came and went in 36 hours.  The symptoms I did have are the same as a bad reaction to the 2nd vaccine.  (my muscle aches are not a reaction to the vaccine).  Yet, my reaction was not immediate, rather it was 2 weeks and 1 day after my first vaccine.  Therefore, do I have COVID, or a bad reaction to my first vaccine? WAITING for COVID test results.  Second vaccination is scheduled for upcoming Friday, February 26.

                                                experiencing a bit of body aches; a little achy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband) from the medical information team. A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose (at the age of 67-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pacemaker/defibrillator and 25% of heart function. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose on 28Jan2021 and was experiencing a bit of body aches (since Jan2021) and was taking paracetamol (TYLENOL), no other symptoms. The consumer had a little concern because the patient has a pacemaker/defibrillator. Before he had the defibrillator, his heart rate was over 300 but now it was normal and the patient was monitored. The patient&#39;s doctor recommended everybody to get the vaccine. The consumer had a concern about the second shot because he heard that the dose was stronger than the first dose. The consumer wanted to know if that was true. The consumer wanted to know if the patient would be fine for the second dose. The consumer added that the patient only has 25% of heart function. They have talked to his doctors, his cardiologist about getting the vaccine. All the heart doctors were telling their heart patient to get the vaccine to prevent them from getting COVID. The consumer added that after receiving the first COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was a little achy (Jan2021) like when he has the flu shot (for immunization on an unspecified date.) He was going to get over that. It was not raising his heart rate or anything. The consumer clarified further that the patient was just achy but has done really well. The patient slept good last night. He has a heart monitor in the bedroom and had no problems. The consumer wanted to understand if the second shot was thicker than the first shot and what was the difference between the first and second vaccine. The patient has not recovered from the events.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness; Almost passed out; Very light headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (shoulder), on 26Jan2021 at 12:00, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, acid reflux, and multivitamin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, esomeprazole for acid reflux, and ascorbic acid/ biotin/ boron/ calcium/ calcium pantothenate/ chloride/ chromium/ colecalciferol/ copper/ cyanocobalamin/ folic acid/ iodine/ lycopene/ magnesium/ manganese/ molybdenum/ nickel/ nicotinamide/ phosphorus/ phytomenadione/ potassium/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol acetate/ riboflavin/ selenium/ silicon dioxide/ sodium metavanadate/ thiamine mononitrate/ tocopheryl acetate/ xantofyl/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER ADULTS 50&#43;) as multivitamin, all were ongoing; omeprazole for acid reflux; and an unspecified multivitamin.  The patient really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. The patient has been administered both first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. The patient had been having some strange things that he didn&#39;t know if its COVID-19 shot related but they&#39;re symptoms he never had before. About 8 to 11 days after first dose of the vaccine (Feb2021; maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021), the patient had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out or almost fainted. The patient clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8 to 11 days. Also, in Feb2021, the patient had almost a very light headache where he almost fainted. The patient went to the emergency room in Feb2021 and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00 to 18:00 the following day. The patient spent the night in hospital, they sent him the next day. While in hospital (Feb2021), the patient had electrocardiograms (EKGs) of his head (as reported), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of his head, computed tomography (CTs; CT scan with contrast) of his head, and echocardiograms of his heart (microcardiogram). All of those tests came back normal (okay), nothing abnormal on results. They were relating this to a stroke-like symptom; however, the results were normal, also his blood test results were fine. The patient had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3 to 4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. The patient was not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because the event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit. Because of the first episode, the patient then went to his family doctor and the doctor ordered some other testing done. The patient was scheduled to get a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test (stress test of heart), his results on 10Mar2021 came back normal (not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine). The patient believed that the results of those tests both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. The patient was continuing to have some lightheaded episodes or symptoms just about daily but nothing really; continued to have symptoms which was not normal for him. Sometimes, they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes, the patient had a good day, but he had those lightheaded episodes and he never had it before he got the shot. As therapeutic measures in the hospital, the emergency room gave the patient something for dizziness when he was there, but he was no longer taking it. Currently, the patient was really taking nothing. The patient had also gone to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor where he had a balance test or a videonystagmography (VNG) test done on 17Mar2021. The patient will get results of balance test on Wednesday (24Mar2021). Every year (unspecified), the patient goes and get his yearly test in which they had his blood work done and this and his glucose levels were always good, cholesterol level was always good. All the patient&#39;s other tests come back as normal on an unspecified date. The patient had never had these symptoms before, he hasn&#39;t changed his medications or habits and it&#39;s odd that this happened 9 to 10 days after both doses of the vaccine. The patient would like to know if this has been reported before as a side effect related to the vaccine. The patient was not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. Also, he does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines. So the patient doesn&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but he had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them around days after each shot and he was continuing to have lightheaded episodes but not severe as those 2 but he had lightheaded (dizzy) episodes daily, since the COVID-19 vaccine. But they didn&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the COVID-19 shot. And he never had anything like that, and he was not blaming it on the COVID-10 shot. That was the only thing changed in his lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, his medication has not changed, and diet doesn&#39;t change. Nothing has changed other than the patient got COVID-19 shots. The patient wanted to report it, so the company had a report file and other people reporting it. The patient wanted to know if the company was having any other report or something like this so that he would know if it might be related to the shot. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

My mother contacted Pfizer who instructed us to alternate Tylenol and Motrin. Tylenol given and Motrin given 4 hours later as instructed by Pfizer. On 3/30/21 around 11:10am my dad was found unresponsive, not breathing and did not have a pulse. My mother immediately called 911 and my aunt began CPR. When EMS arrived he was found to be in cardiac arrest and after 25 min of efforts by EMS my father passed away less than 24 hours after receiving his 2nd covid vaccine.

                                                Vacinnated on Friday..following Sunday evening noticed bumps, blisters, hives on both of my hands in the pad areas of my hands. extended into the tips of index fingers and thumbs. very sensitive to the touch. I took some Benedril which helped with swelling. that was the most severe after effect. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the vaccine because i had not been anywhere that weekend and had not  put my hands on anything unusual that i don&#39;t normally touch. It only happened to my hands. Other than that i had minor flu like symtoms from the shot,  achiness and slight fatigue feeling. I had an ER doctor look at my hands when i went in today to get help for my bronchitis, which i had some before the covid shot. It got worse on Monday. He perscribed prednisone which has pretty much taken the hand spots away..i was tested negative for covid today(1/19/21) by the way.

A 68-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28Dec2020 at 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included diabetic and blood pressure high, both from 10-15 years.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient does nursing homes and assisted living facilities and also the employees of the nursing home. The patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 28Dec2020 at 1800 PM in the left arm. He tested negative on 27Dec2020, 04Jan2021, and 08Jan2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 11Jan2021, which was 2 weeks after the administration of the vaccine. He reported no severe symptoms, all he got from the COVID-19 infection was a little bit of chills, temperatures rising to a maximum of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (temperature back and forth), body aches, oxygen levels at 95%, and no cough. His oxygen saturation has always been good between 95% and 96%. The patient asked what caused the positive test and asked if he was going to have protection after receiving the first dose of COVID vaccine. The patient is due for the second dose of the COVID vaccine on Monday, the 18th (18Jan2021), in which he will still be under isolation. The patient asked if he should wait until he gets out of isolation to receive the second vaccine. The patient asked if that is part of the vaccine to test positive for COVID or if he actually does have COVID. The patient also asked if he can have the second dose. He will be unable to receive second dose of the COVID vaccine at the 21-day mark due to being in isolation from the COVID virus. The patient was recovering from the events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

                                                done in his left arm, and it was a little sore; slight headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number and expiration date were not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies: dust, pollen, grass, and trees. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He received first shot on 04Jan2021, 5 days ago. He has had no bad reactions. He was happy to report. He then stated it was done in his left arm, and it was a little sore. He also had a slight headache that first evening which was unusual for him. So far so good. He was due for his regular allergy shot which he generally gets every 2-3 weeks for dust, pollen, grass, and trees. He lived in (City) and has pretty good allergies. It is said on the allergy shot not to have a flu shot within 72 hours of getting the allergy shot, so he was just wondering if it will be safe for him to have the allergy shot within approximately 120 hours of receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine. &#34;Is it safe or advisable to have his allergy shot done today when it has only been 5 days since getting the COVID vaccine? Is he putting himself at any kind of risk?&#34; He did not have the name of the allergy shot to provide. He said it is just an injection of a little bit of the allergen. He is not a health provider. He was on the early receiving end of the vaccine because he was a hospital volunteer and works in PACU. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

There were no medical histories. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been having side effects such as sharp lower back pain going down his right leg on late thursday (14Jan2021) afternoon, but probably the morning of 15Jan2021, which he never had before. It feels almost like a pinched nerve, but hasn&#39;t done anything to exert himself since he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. He did not cause this pain himself and wanted to know if anybody else has reported this. Outcome of the event was unknown.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3302), intramuscular on 22Jan2021 15:10 at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml by intramuscular injection left shoulder) for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (diagnosed about 21 years ago), ongoing gout (Diagnosed about 2 years ag), ongoing ankle spur right foot, ongoing diminished cartilage both knees, joint pain. The concomitant medications included torsemide. The patient reported adverse event (AE) after his first Pfizer-Biontech covid19 vaccine at 15:10  on 22Jan2021. He reported arm pain starting 3 hours after vaccination until noon the next day (23Jan2021). When he woke up on 23Jan2021 he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute. The pain inhibits walking, standing, etc. He did note that he is &gt;300lbs and has had joint pain in the past, but the hip pain is new. He also thought it might be kidney pain, as he takes a daily diuretic. He stated he has been treating with Aleve twice a day, but that walking is still very bad.  The patient is an optometrist that was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and said that he did not know if the Lot number written on the vaccination card is EL3302, E13302, or EI3302. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and reported that he got a sore arm about 3 hours after receiving the injection. He woke up with a sore lower back pain. He is 5ft 9.5 and 310 lbs and he is on Torsemide, a pretty strong diuretic. He woke up with the back pain and stated that it moved right and middle to his buttocks, a little lower than the end of his spine and to the right. He did not think it was his kidneys. He said that Torsemide can make kidneys work overtime. His knees were pretty shot, the left worse than the right. No further details provided. He was upset to know that he has shrunk a 1.5 inches over the years. He has been taking 2 Aleve a day since Saturday, this morning was his 4th pill. He said that it is really odd when he stands equally on both feet his lower back hurts. He has to sleep on his right side and that it hurts more when he sleeps on his back and on his left side. He was fearful doing eye exams next to his patient and how the lower back pain would affect him.  Reporter considered seriousness for Lower back pain was Medically significant. The outcome of event lower back pain was not recovered; of event arm pain was recovered on 23Jan2021; of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event low back pain cannot be excluded. The ongoing gout and concomitant drug torsemide may also play contributory roles to the event.

                                                Contrast head CT scan showed a lacunar infarct in the M1 region from MCA; Bell&#39;s Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician reporting for himself. A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL2437), intramuscularly on 13Jan2021 11:00 on right arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type was at Clinic. Medical history included Myocardial infarction from 2019, Prostate cancer from 2016 which biochemical reoccurrence caused his PSA to bump up, Subclinical hypothyroidism, prevention of coronary artery disease, prevent platelet aggregation, urgency incontenece, asthma symptoms, High Blood Pressure from 2009 and ongoing, Aortic insufficiency from 2008 and ongoing. Ongoing concomitant medications included Carvedilol from 2011 for high blood pressure, rosuvastatin from 2015 for prevention of coronary artery disease, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) from 2019 for prevent platelet aggregation, tamsulosin from Dec2020 for urgency incontenece, levothyroxine from 2011 for Subclinical hypothyroidism, montelukast from 2011 for asthma symptoms. The caller stated that he was a physician and emeritus professor. He received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and developed Bell&#39;s Palsy on 24Jan2021 after receiving this first dose. He had already reported this reaction but he would like to know if there was any safety information on receiving the second dose after this type of adverse reaction. Patient had &#34;mentioned&#34; the reaction to his HCP but he had not spoken with her about specific guidance on whether or not to receive the second dose. Patient wished there was a way he could see more information regarding patients who have reported Bell&#39;s Palsy as a reaction to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to see if it could be a trend related to mRNA in the vaccines or if it was statistically insignificant. Patient visited the Emergency Room on 25Jan2021. Patient had a Contrast head CT scan on 25Jan2021. The results were read by the radiologist. The neuro radiologist also read the results and made a revision. He had two different reports, it showed a lacunar infarct in the M1 region from MCA. Not causing facial paralysis. There was no defined cause of the paralysis. Patient was asking if we have a resource on the significance of Bell&#39;s Palsy following a vaccine. He was scheduled to have the booster on 04Feb2021 and needed to know what to do. Treatment was received for the events included Prednisone and Acyclovir. The outcome of the events were not resolved.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported Bell&#39;s Palsy and lacunar infarct, and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 1 week after the Pfizer dose I had a small lump and soreness over my right flank at the kidney level.  Over the next two days that pain migrated to my right buttock and radiated down my right leg.  With full weight applied to my right leg the leg had weakness and would occasionally buckle.  I am due for my second injection but am considering not taking the second injection fearing permanent nerve involvement.  As of today 2/23 the pain in my right leg and buttocks is lessened but still present.

Outside temp was about 58 degrees F. Two days later numbness spread to adjoining index and ring fingers. They became very painful and sensitive to touch. Visits to primary care doctor, hand specialist and vascular surgeon is pointing to circulation problem. Finger tip continue to be extremely painful with no relief. Large black areas have formed on two fingers and is spreading to my right hand

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

                                                This was my second vaccine for Covid.  I experience headache, shaking chill and flu- like symptoms.  My left arm was also sore.  I had similar sx with the firat dose of the two but the second dose was definitley more symptomatic.  My chillswere so bad that I could bvarely open the Tylenol container to get the medicine out.  I should also state that I also had the Covid disease and I know that this is a risk factor for having a reaction.  I think people should be told that they could have a reaction so they do not plan anything important the following day, but they should still get the vaccine. The day following the reaction I felt perfect.

This consumer reported for a 72-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 08:00 at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 prevention. The medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the shot on 19Jan2021. Since Jan2021, his arm was still sore, but he had been nauseated since then. He has no energy. He has had it almost four days. He was fine until he got it and his arm is sore and he is nauseated. He is usually on the go. The patient also has an inflamed liver. He has been sick since. The patient has no appetite, he is sweating, his bones are hurting, and he is tired. The consumer took her husband to his doctor, and they tested him for COVID, and it came back negative, but the consumer does not think the PA did the test right. The consumer doesn&#39;t know what to do with him, because he is still tired, and has no appetite. The patient is breaking out in cold chills, and his bones are still sore. When the patient got the vaccine, he was walking and talking, and by 11 AM that day, he was in bed. The patient had some labs done, and was being told that his liver is big, so the consumer did not know if the vaccine went to his liver. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Each attack lasted 15 to 25 minutes, and seemed to be alleviated by taking anti-acid (simethicone) pills. Quite likely related the vaccine: 11 days after the vaccine was administered, I experienced a rather severe headache, plus slight general weakness, and a raised temperature of between 98.9 and 100.4 degrees. The first 10 days I had discerned no adverse effects. This has lasted16 hours so far, with little alleviation.

                                                terrible terrible stomach pain; bug in his colon; white blood cell 18000/19500; his blood pressure was out of the roof; could not eat anymore; he&#39;s lost 10 pounds; dehydrated; vomiting 5 times; nausea; feeling warm; broke out in sweats; arm was sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included heart rate irregular and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications were none. The patient said he had an irregular heartbeat after getting his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021. He said he had to go to the Emergency Room on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He clarified he checked his blood pressure at home and his blood pressure was low at 91/73. He said he also had a high pulse rate of 160, or better, for 9-1/2 hours. He said the only thing he can attribute his low blood pressure and high pulse rate to is the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he hasn&#39;t heard anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine being related to having an effect on the heart, but he personally believes it was his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose that caused his low blood pressure and high pulse rate. He clarified after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021, he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, fatigue, tiredness, and nausea. He said on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he recognized a small amount of chills, feeling feverish without having a fever, and sweating. He said his wife checked his temperature a few times on Saturday, 30Jan2021, and he never had a fever, but he felt clammy. He said he had noticed the nausea more than anything else. He said he maybe should have checked his blood pressure on Saturday, 30Jan2021. He said he didn&#39;t check his blood pressure until Sunday morning, 31Jan2021, and when he saw his low blood pressure and high pulse rate, he called the hospital and eventually drove to the Emergency Room. He said by the time he had got to the Emergency Room his blood pressure had went up to &#34;100 and something&#34;, but his pulse rate never changed, and his pulse was still 160. He said the doctor gave him several medications to try to get his pulse rate to come down. He said the doctor had given him a medication that was supposed to bring his pulse down. He said then the doctor had to add something else in a syringe to go with the other medication to bring his pulse down. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the medication&#39;s name. He clarified he never noticed his pulse rate was high until he took his blood pressure on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he felt the nausea start later Friday evening (29Jan2021). He said he already has stomach trouble anyways that he takes medicine for, so he took a pill, but the nausea continued. He clarified he took 1 Omeprazole 20mg capsule that was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, but stated the Omeprazole 20mg prescription looked like it expired in 2017. He said he knows he has a newer Omeprazole prescription, but did not know where the prescription bottle was. He reported on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he just laid around. He said he did not feel as bad on Saturday, as he did on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he called the Emergency Room on Sunday morning, and went to the Emergency Room. He said he didn&#39;t feel his 160 pulse rate. He said he was told by the doctor in the Emergency Room that his fast heart rate had his heart beating like he was having a stress test. He reported he doesn&#39;t know if he wants to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after what he experienced this past weekend. He reported he only takes blood pressure medicine that he has  been on for a while. He reported he had several EKGs done on Sunday, 31Jan2021, while he was in the Emergency Room. He said the EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 160s. He reported while he was in the Emergency Room he was given IV Heparin, IV Potassium, Potassium pills, and Amiodarone in a pill and IV form. He said the doctor added another IV medicine in a syringe, but he doesn&#39;t know the name of the medicine. He said the doctor also gave him IV Morphine because he had pain in his chest. He said the doctor said his chest pain was being caused by his heart trying to go back into a regular rhythm.  He reported he was in the Emergency Room for 11-12 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. He said his pulse rate wasn&#39;t coming down and stayed at 160 for 9-1/2 hours. He said the doctor wanted to admit him to the hospital, so he could have a procedure to make sure the high pulse rate didn&#39;t damage his heart. He said on Monday, 01Feb2021, he had a procedure where they went through his wrist and put a dye in his heart to see if the stress from his high pulse rate damaged his heart. He said his heart wasn&#39;t damaged, so he was discharged from the hospital later in the day on 01Feb2021. He clarified his blood pressure was good by the time the first or second EKG was performed in the Emergency Room. He clarified he already had an issue with sweating before he received his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he is still sweating, but he doesn&#39;t know if that is because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical outcome of high pulse rate and blood pressure low was recovered on 31Jan2021; nausea, fatigue/tiredness recovered on 02Feb2021; chills, feeling feverish recovered on an unspecified date; sweating was not recovered; while for the other events was unknown.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time. I lost 17 lbs and if I try to walk my lungs shut down.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

E10142, via an unspecified route of administration (administered to the left arm) on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for Covid vaccination administered at facility. Medical history included 100% disabled, Covid from Jul2020, hospitalized from 21Jul2020 to 26Jul2020, blood plasma, and sore. No relevant family medical history relevant to AEs. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient previously took remdesivir. The patient called to report side effects after getting the first Pfizer COVID vaccination. He got it on 19Jan2021. He had COVID before. Last summer he hadn&#39;t left the house for 20 plus weeks and their son who was living with them brought the COVID virus in to them. His son and wife were asymptomatic and suffered at the house and he was completely disabled, with underlying conditions had to drag himself to the facility. He eventually had to be hospitalized on 21Jul2020. He had blood plasma and remdesivir and stayed in the hospital from Tuesday through Sunday. After getting the treatment, he felt like superman. On 20Jan2021, he next day, about 24 hours later he started feeling sick again, he felt like when he had COVID back in Jul2020. It lasted for 24 hours, terrible headache, chills, aches, and a little diarrhea. He said after he got the vaccine, 24 hours later, his arm got sorer and sorer. He had 99.9 F fever and a terrible headache. He also put on a little weight on an unspecified date. No emergency room visit. No relevant tests. He called the facility the next morning and they told him to rest. He slept all day and the next day he felt like superman again. He called the facility that Thursday morning and they instructed him to relax and that it seemed to affect people who have had the COVID virus before, they have that reaction, and it should subside and it did. He stated his side effects were about 20% of what they were when he actually had COVID. The clinic told him that if he had any reaction to call and that Thursday he just relaxed. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. Never had any problems with shots, not really. He remembered when he went to specific area they gave him a whole bunch of shots with these guns and he was just sore a couple days, but that was it, no big deal. The patient underwent lab test which included COVID-19 positive Jul2020. The outcome of feeling sick, headache, chills, ache, diarrhea was recovering while outcome of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021107344 Same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

I then vomited 1 hour later and then every 30-60 minutes for the next 12 hours.  After the first 4 episodes of emesis, I was only vomiting bile.  I felt wiped out and very weak and slept when I wasn&#39;t vomiting.  On the 10th, I had generalized muscle aches but no more vomiting.  On the 11th, I am finally feeling better but not really normal yet.

Seems to have gotten worse since Monday when he had his first Covid vaccine here at the hospital.  Denies any headaches or neck pain.  No fevers or chills.  No cough or shortness of breath.  No abdominal pain.  No vomiting or diarrhea.  No black or bloody stools.  No dizziness.  Today he almost fell and the son had to catch him.  He did not suffer any trauma.  He offers no symptoms of pain.  Here he is fully awake and alert.  Nothing to clinically suspect a stroke.  His vitals are stable.  Chest x-ray shows nothing acute.  Creatinine is better than baseline.  Electrolytes are stable.  Troponin reassuring.  He had no chest pain or shortness of breath to suspect angina.  Spoke to the wife via telephone, he is getting so weak that he was unable to walk.  Paramedics report they had lift him as he could not take a step.  He was unable to ambulate here in the emergency room.  At this time it does not seem like I can safely discharge him home.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

This is now accompanied by an area of numbness in the same area. The pain symptoms are aggravated by extension of the arm. These symptoms have persisted for the past week or so. I don?t know if they will be permanent.  I believe this was caused by injection into a peripheral nerve by injecting too distally into the deltoid.  My suggestion is to review proper injection techniques (e.g. location) to all who are giving injections.
