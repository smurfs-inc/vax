It cleared in approximately a minute. The 2nd heat flash came on about 5 to 10 minutes later and cleared about a minute later. The 3rd heat flash came on about another 5 to 10 minutes, again clearing at about 1 minute. Next I felt like my head was in a fog, found it very hard to focus, and was forgetting what I was doing. I walked over to the office, my supervisor asked if I was ok as she said it looked like my eyes were glazed over, my head was still in a fog. This cleared by 2:30 p.m.

When returning to my office my manager asked if I was ok and said my eyes were glossed over and my face was red. All this cleared around 2:30 pm.

A 60-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: ELO140; Batch number: 20201221E; Expiration date was not reported) on 21Dec2020 at a single dose, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included previously having COVID-19 from Oct2020 to an unspecified date; abnormal cholesterol; and abnormal blood pressure. Concomitant medications included acyclovir [aciclovir] (ACYCLOVIR); atorvastatin for abnormal cholesterol; hydrochlorothiazide, losartan potassium (LOSARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE ACTAVIS) for abnormal blood pressure; and vitamin D NOS. On 22Dec2020, the patient had fever. In Dec2020, the patient had sweated the whole night; and had slept for 24 hours and that was abnormal. The patient had body temperature values of 101.4 to 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit on 22Dec2020; and 98.8 to 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit on 23Dec2020. The patient had received ibuprofen (MOTRIN) and paracetamol (TYLENOL) as treatment for the fever. The patient considered his adverse reaction &#34;mildish&#34;.

                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

                                                Pt received the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine on Sunday 1/17/21 and developed a sore arm, but otherwise had no symptoms. By Tuesday 1/19/21, he was having shooting pains through his shoulder and down to his elbow. By late Wednesday, he had started to develop hives on his palm, between his fingers, and up to the elbow. Pt states he has a history of a pinched nerve in his neck and elbow, but this pain is nothing like his usual pain.  On 1/22, pt presented to the ED for left uper arm pain and rash. He denied new detergents, foods, clothes, wooded area exposure. Denied decreased ROM in shoulder, but ROM makes his shoulder sore. BP 161/82, otherwise vitals normal. Rash did not apear infectious. No evidence for DVT. Pt received ketorolac 30 mg IM x 1 in ED and was prescribed hydrocodone-APAP 5-325 mg tabs PO Q6h PRN #8. Pt was instructed to follow up with PCP in 1-2 days.  By 1/25/21, pt reports the hives have become dark purple, like bruises. He states he has trouble making a fist and is not using his left arm at all - when this writer spoke to him, he said it was &#34;gimpy.&#34; Pt stated during the phone call that he was about to call his PCP for a follow up appointment.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 60-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 08:00 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, stent, and cholesterol. Concomitant medication included metformin for diabetes, atorvastatin from 2009 (also reported as Jan2020) for cholesterol, ticagrelor (BRILINTA, NDC: 01860776-60, LOT: MM0189, EXP: Apr2023), saxagliptin hydrochloride (ONGLYZA, NDC: 0310-6105-90, LOT: MJ0731, EXP: Feb2023) for diabetes, and terbinafine. The patient experienced felt bad the first day, chills, wooziness/ woozy, felt wobbly all on 12Jan2021. Then experienced feeling like has a big weight on him, blood sugar has been lower than normal, it is usually normal at 110-120, it is lower today at 96/ checked his blood sugar again later and it was 153, which is not through the roof on 14Jan2021, and he is real tired on Jan2021. Patient says he got the Pfizer vaccine, clarified to Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a couple days ago and the first day he felt bad and had chills and felt wobbly and woozy. He says yesterday (13Jan2021) he felt pretty good, and even worked out. He says he also worked out today, but he has had chills and feels like he has a big weight walking on him, he doesn&#39;t know the right word. He says he is also a diabetic, and he noticed today that his blood sugar has been lower than normal, it is usually normal at 110-120, it is lower today at 96. He says he is careful with his diet and eats the same thing. He says he hasn&#39;t taken his meds today, and he checked his blood sugar again later and it was 153, which is not through the roof, even without his medication so he would like to know does the vaccine affect your blood sugar? He says he got his first dose of the vaccination on Tuesday at 08:00AM, in his left arm. He clarifies that he has had chills today and then feels like there is a big heavy weight on him, he is real tired and his sugar is low, that was odd. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Double Covid Pneumonia; feeling tired; weak; doctors were concerned that the Covid vaccine had taxed his immune system; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient; a direct care staff for a group home).  A 60-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: 613247, expiration date: May2021), intramuscularly to the left arm on 21Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization. He was given the vaccine at work. It&#39;s a group home facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure, and positive for the covid virus from 09Jan2021 to an unknown date. Concomitant medication included benazepril from 22Jan2021 and ongoing for high blood pressure. He saw a doctor on 22Jan2021 and he prescribed Benazepril; it was started on 22Jan2021. The patient previously received a flu vaccine on Sep2020 for immunization. The patient called about the Covid vaccine. He reported that on 09Jan2021, he was positive for the COVID virus. He was then cleared on 16Jan2021 to go to work. His work then offered the COVID vaccine on 21Jan2021 and he got it. Then on 29Jan2021, he was diagnosed with Double Covid Pneumonia. His doctors were concerned that the Covid vaccine had taxed his immune system. The patient was a direct care staff for a group home. He cares for adults that are developmentally challenged. He has a CPR license. The patient confirmed that he received his first dose of the vaccine on 21Jan2021. He started feeling tired and weak about evening of 22Jan2021. He then started feeling out of breath Wednesday 27Jan2021, 28Jan2021 Thursday, and Friday 29Jan2021. He thought maybe he might be having a normal side effect. He stated that the Double Covid Pneumonia was detected on the X-ray that took place on the 29Jan2021. He is scheduled for second dose on 11Feb2021. The patient stated that the weakness was horrible. They gave him antibiotics; he was starting to recover. He was off of work till Saturday due to the pneumonia. He doesn&#39;t know if he will be getting the second dose. The patient was prescribed antibiotic Cefuroxime Axetil 500mg 1 tablet by mouth twice a day for 7 days, antibiotic Doxycycline Monohydrate 100mg 1 tablet by mouth twice a day 7 days, a Steroid Prednisone 20mg 2 tablets by mouth daily at same time in morning for 5 days, and a breather Albuterol HFA 90mcg/att inhale 2 puffs by mouth every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath, wheezing, or cough. It was reported that they did a Covid Nasal Swab Test on 09Jan2021, then on that Sunday or Monday he got positive result, and by that time he had fatigue. After he got the vaccine, he went back to work. After the vaccine, it was a big surprise about the double Covid pneumonia, and they think it was taxing the immune system. He has had no issues with vaccines in the past. He had a Flu vaccine recently and there was no problem, that was Sep2020. He wants to know should he get the second dose.The outcome of the events double Covid pneumonia and &#34;doctors were concerned that the Covid vaccine had taxed his immune system&#34;  was unknown. Regarding his double Covid pneumonia, the doctor said his O2 level will determine how he is doing. They will also do another lung X-ray. The doctor said the antibiotic should take care of it. The doctor did warn him that things could get worse. They said he can possibly go back to work on 06Feb2021, but this is not certain at the moment; it could change.

Icing the area did nothing to reduce the throbbing.  SECOND: Progressive Myasthenia Gravis weakening began about 20 hours after the injection. It was escalating toward being a full-blown crisis. I have an emergency stash of Prednisone, and I alerted my Neurologist that I began taking it. Prednisone effect saved me from a full-blown bulbar deficit, which would have required hospitalization. For MG, I&#39;ve long only needed to take CellCept to be symptom-free. The Pfizer shot IS to blame for the MG exacerbation

Thumb is included in this numbness .   First inoculation was  25 Feb.  No lingering symptoms.  Second inoculation was  19 March.  Finger numbness seemed to appear about two days after second shot around 21 March.  Numbness still persists even after a week.   I felt this numbness was a strange development after the second shot and worth reporting.

A 61 year old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) at the age of 60 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Mar2021 (Lot Number: EL6205) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, mouth started to feel numb and allergies to tree pollen; and family history of diabetic and heart disease (father); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included losartan potassium (TEMISARTAN), gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), furosemide, potassium, valproate semisodium (DIVALPROEX) and tizanidine; all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. The next day, he said his mouth started to feel numb, and he had a loss of taste. Then on Saturday, his eyes started to tear a lot, and the right side of his face started drooping like that of a stroke. He also said he had headache on the back of his head, and his eyes do not. The patient wanted to know if he should go to the emergency room or if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine. The patient did have a sensation starting on Thursday of numbness in his mouth. The patient describes it as a feeling like when he was younger and would use chloraseptic spray, it feels like same numbness. He states that on Saturday his eyes started tearing up, and he does have allergies to tree pollen. The right side of his face feels and looks like he had a stroke, it is droopy on right side. The patient can&#39;t pronounce words right, can&#39;t smile, and can&#39;t close his right eye. The patient was checked with heart rate and EKG with his little machine and his temperature, and they all seem fine. The patient was also getting headaches at the back of his head. The patient took Advil for headaches, but it is not improving. The patient ran out of the Advil and doesn&#39;t have the bottle anymore. The patient took allergy pills, a knock off Benadryl, because he thought his eye tearing was possibly from allergies to tree pollen allergy or possible allergic reaction to the drug. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fine, CAT: not reported, EKG: fine, complete blood work: not reported and heart rate: fine; all on 15Mar2021. The outcome of loss of taste was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Medical history includes Hypertension, Gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), prostate cancer and broncholith left lung. The patient has no known allergy. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, losartan, pantoprazole, hctz, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN). The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730) on 17Dec2020 and experienced mild numbness and tingling in arms and legs following first dose of vaccine, followed by progressive weakness in legs. On 19Jan2021, the patient developed severe back and leg pain resulting in spinal fusion surgery on 25Jan2021. Postoperatively, the patient developed spastic twitching in thighs on 31Jan2021. On 07Feb2021, he woke up with weakness and clumsiness in left hand. At post-op check for spinal surgery on 10Feb2021, the neurosurgeon recommended another MRI and mentioned possibility of Transverse Myelitis. Following this MRI on 15Feb2021, he was again admitted to hospital for more extensive work up and was admitted for 6 days. Diagnosis made of Transverse Myelitis and was started on high dose steroid treatment and was discharged to home on 17Feb2021. Since then have had profound leg weakness, right side greater than left, which severely impairs mobility, especially stairs. He completed 5 day course of 1000 mg methylprednisolone per day as an outpatient on 20Feb2021. He is in PT and is unable to predict date of return to work. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Disability or permanent damage. Treatment for the events included high dose steroid therapy, PT and exercise. The patient underwent COVID test post vaccination via nasal swab on 24Jan2021 and was negative. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information the reported events are unlikely related to BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent medical conditions.

I had violent &amp; severe neck pain and severe headaches. Also an extremely stiff neck where I couldn?t turn it 1/8th oh an inch to either side.  It all got so severe that I didn?t eat for days at a time and was literally not with it.  Couldn?t respond when spoken to, and became excessively weak where I couldn?t walk w/o help, and speech was slurred.  It all lasted 5 days where it was so severe.  With medication it slowly began to back off.

A 60-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER6208) as single dose at the age of 60-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included disability. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced losing strength in his right leg in Mar2021, his leg kept getting worse in 2021, he just can not walk anymore in 2021, leg is swollen in 2021, muscle pain in Mar2021 with, joint pain in Mar2021, muscle spasms in his neck because he has neck pain too in 2021.   The events losing strength in his right leg, his leg kept getting worse, he just can not walk anymore and leg is swollen were assessed medically significant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: leg is swollen in 2021, X-ray: nothing showed up in 2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of losing strength in his right leg, muscle pain, joint pain.  The course of events was as follows:  Around 21 Mar2021 or 22Mar2021, he had problems with his leg. Patient was experiencing muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg. Patient stated that was a problem. Patient had an MRI and X-ray that looked to see what the problem was. Patient received second dose on 14Apr2021. Patient hasn&#39;t even seen his prescribing Healthcare Professional yet, until Monday. He hasn&#39;t worked in five years, he&#39;s been on disability. He wanted to get off disability so he went and got a job. He started the job 28Mar2021 and everyday, his leg kept getting worse. He had to leave the job the other day because he just cant walk anymore, he has to do a lot of walking on the job. He called the doctor and told them something was wrong with his leg, they took an x-ray and nothing showed up. They did an MRI and all it shows was that his leg was swollen, no bones or nothing is broken. He was looking at Pfizer paperwork that a facility gave him and the two of symptoms are on there, so this problem was related to the vaccine. He never hurt his right leg, never had a problem until he got this shot. He was losing all his strength in his right leg, all the pain. They have been giving muscle relaxers and ibuprofen and they did not seem to work or be doing anything. First, he went to the emergency room and they gave him Ibuprofen 600 mg tablets and they gave him Cyclobenzaprine 10mg tablets. They said that he was experiencing muscle spasms in his neck because he has neck pain too. So he made an appointment with his family doctor, which there was no openings and had to see another PA. He did not know the HCP last name, but he/she was a PA in the office and he saw him/her, who requested the x-ray, and he had the x-ray done and saw him/her again and nothing showed up so he/she requested an MRI. He went to the hospital to have that and nothing showed up except his leg was swollen. Now they are going to send him to a bone specialist, but there was no reason to because now he stated he knew what was causing this. Patient took Cyclobenzaprine, 10 mg, three times a day by mouth. He states it did not seem to do nothing. Patient verified it was a prescription from the pharmacy:  NDC: 0137517-19674, unsure of LOT, expiry date. The quantity of the first bottle was 15 but he went through that already and he got a new bottle that has 42 in it. This current bottle he has 12 or 13 left. The first bottle was completely gone. Patient took Baclofen 5mg tablets, three times a day: morning, noon, and night. They were not doing anything either, well he did not think they are. Patient provided NDC: 0135391-19674. The first muscle relaxer they gave him, the 10mg one, he took it that day, it knocked him out. Caller states when he saw his doctor, he said he can not take that one while he works, he will take it at night time, so that is why the doctor gave him the other muscle relaxer, Baclofen, to take while he worked during the day. He took one muscle relaxer at night of one kind and the other kind he takes the ones that won&#39;t take him out as much. Patient stated that he had to leave his job because he cannot do it, he cannot walk. Patient took Ibuprofen (NDC: 0139246-19674, to use before 22Apr2022) 600mg, by mouth, three times a day. He took one with the muscle relaxers. Patient took verified all medications Cyclobenzaprine; Baclofen; Ibuprofen were prescriptions from the pharmacy. The outcome of muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg, his leg kept getting worse, was not recovered of he just can not walk anymore on, leg is swollen, neck pain was unknown. Reporter seriousness for muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg and neck pain was unspecified Patient received his second dose of Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine (LOT: EW0161, unsure if ER or EW) on 14Apr2021.  A Product Complaint was filed.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

This 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL1442), via intramuscular, on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 61-year-old. Vaccine location was deltoid left. The subject did not have a relevant medical history and concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021, the patient developed high fever, vomiting, severe fatigue and weakness. He did not experience anaphylaxis. The events were considered serious as medically significant. The patient stated that side effects mentioned lasted 3 hours and he felt much better now. However, the final clinical outcome was unknown. The patient is not sure if he should get the shot again in 3 weeks since he was really sick.  The reporting physician considered the events &#39;high fever&#39;, &#39;vomiting&#39;, &#39;severe fatigue&#39; and &#39;weakness&#39; related to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, vomiting, fatigue and asthenia cannot be excluded.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other hcp.    A 61-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot # EH9899), intramuscular in the right arm  on 17Dec2020 10:15 at single dose  for Covid-19 immunisation .  Medical history included lung neoplasm malignant , adenocarcinoma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included duloxetine (DULOXETINE), levetiracetam (LEVETIRACETAM), omeprazole (OMEPRAZOLE), olanzapine (OLANZAPINE), hydromorphone (HYDROMORPHONE) , fentanyl (FENTANYL PATCH), bisacodyl (BISACODYL).  The patient experienced Bell&#39;s palsy  on 02Jan2021 with outcome of recovered.   The patient had to be treated in Emergency room/department or urgent care; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

                                                Per patient, he received his second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 02/20/2021.  Approximately 48 hours later, he developed left-sided lip paralysis.  He went to his doctor that day, no medications were prescribed and no tests were ordered.  Over the next 24 hours, he states that his symptoms progressively worsened and now the left side of his face seems &#34;completely paralyzed.&#34;  He described left ear pain, increased sensitivity to loud sounds, runny nose, and inability to close his left eye.  He saw another doctor the next day, who diagnosed Bell&#39;s Palsy and prescribed valacyclovir for 7 days. Patient also noticed a transient &#34;crooked smile&#34; after his first dose of Pfizer vaccine, but did not relate this

Strong but not splitting headache. Not like a migraine--not at all as bad.  Very minor nose congestion and sore throat.  Symptoms all ended by 36 hours after 2nd shot

                                                After the vaccine he came home, felt a little less sore than a flu shot.  The next day when he took a shower, and when he went to wash under his armpit was very swollen, and very tender.   He put some ice on it which did not help the swelling.  It bothers him when his T-shirt touches the area, so he tried to wear a regular shirt.  He also had achy pain in his back, weakness in his arms, sore throat and a little cough, no fever.  The armpit still hurts and is still swollen.  Other than the ice he did not take anything else as he takes a lot of medications as it is.  He has not called his doctor because it happened over the weekend, but is going to call her today.   He did have a COVID test yesterday drive through facility at the community hospital as he has a surgery coming up, and they were going to call him if it was positive.  He is scheduled for surgery on his right knee on Thursday.

The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown.

                                                Within two hours of injection, I began to feel numbness in my right foot. Later that day, I experienced tingling in my fingers on both hands. This has continued for several days now and has worsened today (three days after injection), with the tingling being stronger and moving into my calves. I have had no loss of strength or coordination. I had similar peripheral neuropathy about 20 to 25 years ago; no reason was ever found, and it went away. This is the first recurrence in many years, and by far the most widespread on my body and the most acute sensations.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded.

                                                Within 15 minutes of my 2nd covid shot I developed extreme lightheadedness, shortness of breath, disorientation, dehydration and consequently extreme anxiety from the incident. I was taken to an examination room at the vaccination clinic by their nurse director. Blood pressure was high and there was a question if I was having a stroke or heart incident. the director sent me by ambulance to Hospital as they didn&#39;t know if I was having an anaphylactic shock or cardiac incident. All this occurred within an hour if the first symptoms.

                                                March 26, 2021: One week to the day after receiving my second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine, my right eye suddenly had double vision and facial pain behind the right eye and all around the right eye (forehead, right temple, around to under the right eye on the cheek).  The right eye would not move correctly.    March 27, 2021: I went to see Optometrist.  He performed an eye exam with dilation and stated that the right eye was slow to track, and that the nerve behind the right eye was inflamed.  He recommended blood work, CT scan, and an MRI.    March 27, 2021 ? March 28, 2021: We went to ER at 9:00pm.  After waiting six hours, I finally was able to see an ER doctor.  No medical history was taken.  No bloodwork was done.  ER Dr performed a CT scan as Dr requested.  CT scan w/o contrast showed no masses or hemorrhages.  ER suggested to follow-up with Nuerology.  March 29, 2021: Went to Neurologist and he examined me.  He called in another Dr for a second opinion.  They stated that it may be a possible cranial nerve palsy and ordered multiple MRIs.    March 29, 2021: The earliest MRI appointment available was April 7, 2021.  Scheduled the MRI.  April 1, 2021: Had blood drawn at lab as Dr requested.  April 2, 2021: Two weeks from the day of COVID19 vaccine #2, my right eyelid would not open at all and the pain was getting worse.  April 5, 2021: Went to ER at 4:30am.  Triage nurse sent me straight to an ER room and within minutes an ER doctor was there.  Within 15 minutes after seeing the ER doctor, a Neurologist was examining me.  The nuero doctor was very thorough.  While waiting for the MRI, other neurologists and residents also examined me.  MRI scans with and without contrast were performed.  MRI images were clear ? no tumors, no aneurisms, and no stroke.  They concluded that it was a micro-vascular injury to cranial nerve #3.  (Similar to the Bells Palsy that I had in 2015.)  They prescribed gabapentin to help calm the nerve pain.  Follow-up will be with nuero-ophthalmologist.

The patients medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient experienced the day after he took the shot on 17Mar2021, a migraine, it was awful, the migraine came down to a headache and he haven&#39;t had that level of migraine. Since then his headache is not gone away and he does not know if he has migraine right now but it was not improved on 17Mar2021. Patient reported he was not going to take the second shot. But he is scheduled to take the second shot tomorrow, but there is no way he could take that. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                I felt fine following the 2nd shot, for 48 hours, but unusally tired so I knew it must have been the shot. The next day my sinuses became burning and I assumed it was hayfever because I had experienced some symptoms of that for the previous two weeks. But the next day, Tues., it was worst, like a bad cold (which all of this &#34;reaction&#34; may have been), but then the next 3 days I could barely get out of bed--and that&#39;s unusual because I run every day and nothing stops me. I had bad headaches for 5 days or so and that included coughing, from a dry cough at first to a very wet cough and very large thick segments of gelled mucous coming out of my sinuses, something I&#39;ve never seen before. After almost two weeks I felt much better but was still coughing, and now three weeks later I&#39;m still really tired, can&#39;t think as tightly as usual.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                Pt had some amazing hallucinations and was actively communicating while I believe he was asleep.  He called me on the phone and his voice was slurred and he thought he was being held down by some things that were flying around.  I was able to direct him to sit up after ensuring him that he wasn&#39;t being held down and eventually get him to walk to the bathroom, turn on the light and look in the mirror and describe to me what he saw (he lives at a different address than I do).  By this time, he had &#34;woken&#34; up and his voice was no longer slurred and he was &#34;making sense&#34;.  My concern was that he had had a stroke or Bell&#39;s palsy or something.  He was fine and slept well the rest of the night.  I will bring him to my home after his second shot just in case this happens again.  He hallucinated after his anti-anxiety medications for the first couple of weeks and to a more minor amount with his other medications, again for the first couple of weeks.  I am assuming that his brain reacted to the vaccine with hallucinations but I don&#39;t know.   This may be nothing or it may be something that other patients are experiencing, who the heck knows.

A contactable consumer reported for himself, a 62-year-old male patient who received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as by injection) to left arm on 14Jan2021 at 3pm at single dose to prevent COVID/COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. Concomitant medications included antidepressants. The patient received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine last 14Jan2021 at 3pm, and everything went well. When he left the place, he had a slight headache. He had to stay there for 15-20 minutes to make sure he had no reaction. He just got a little lightheaded, he didn&#39;t think much, and it didn&#39;t get worse. The patient took 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL) and forgot about it. It went away for a while. He took the shot at 3 pm and he took paracetamol at 4 pm. Later that night, about 10 pm, everything kicked in. He was sick again at 10:30 pm, or so, the headache was gone for several hours. He was ok between 4 pm and 10 pm. Then about 10 to 10:30 pm, when he went to go to sleep, his heart started racing, like he was having a panic attack, then he started getting hot flashes, sweating, chills, and aching, and this went all night from like 10 pm to 11 to the next morning. He had a doctor&#39;s appointment to get his knee examined for an upcoming knee surgery. The patient clarified that he didn&#39;t go to the doctor because of the symptoms, he went for his knee. He asked the doctor, before getting examined, and the doctor said he got off easy, as the doctor himself was sick for 3 days. The patient asked the doctor if he could take something to calm down, as his blood pressure was high on 15Jan2021 at 8 am. They had taken his blood pressure to examine his knee, and the doctor said it was alright. He was prescribed with alprazolam (XANAX), and the doctor said it would be fine. The next day, he was tired from the night before. He had no symptoms the next day. After he took alprazolam, he slept fine, he felt better. The hot flashes, heart racing, body aches, and chills were gone, and he read everything as far as symptoms. The heart racing went away about 11 the next morning because he took alprazolam. The patient stated that he forgot to add one more, he had all the symptoms described as side effects, but he also had itching. He had very mild itching and was given cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC, lot number: OHE2723, expiry date: Feb2022, UPC: 4122053077), it was like 80% gone. Every now and again he has a little itch, but it was bothering him all night that first night. Currently, the patient felt pretty good. He has no symptoms other than the slight itch. He further stated that his second dose is on 04Feb2021. Out of all symptoms, the thing that freaked him out the most was the heart racing, he asked if he could take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) before the shot. He has been on antidepressants for a while, he has a lot of anxiety, but the day he went in, he felt good, and didn&#39;t take alprazolam. He also asked if this have triggered all that heart racing stuff. He was seeking for information if there was anything to do to prepare him better, he knew you have to sit there for 15-20 minutes to see if there was a reaction. The outcome of the event headache and lightheadedness was recovered on 14Jan2021, unknown for blood pressure high and tiredness, recovering for itchy, and recovered on 15Jan2021 at 11 am for all other events.

                                                Intense pain to R foot within 12 hours; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 10:30 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident, Penicillin allergy.  The patient experienced intense pain to R foot within 12 hours on 30Dec2020 01:30 with outcome of recovered with sequelae. Treatment received for the adverse event included: MRI, Ultrasound, Interventional radiology. The patient was hospitalized for intense pain to R foot within 12 hours for 9 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Interventional radiology, magnetic resonance imaging, Nasal Swab test: negative, ultrasound scan.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 62-year-old male patient had medical history included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular accident.  The reported intense pain to R foot was more likely due to intercurrent condition/disease, and less likely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information, including MRI and Ultrasound findings and Interventional radiology details, become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within 1 minute of vaccine being injected. I started to feel dizzy. I was wheeled in wheelchair to observation area. I kept feeling more dizzy and started to feel tingly in my fingers and legs (both sides equally) After 15 minute observation time was over, I tried to stand up and immediately sat down again as a wave of dizziness  hit me. Doctor in observation area saw me and came over. I told him how I felt. He put his fingers to my wrist and felt my pulse. It was initially between 40 and 90, then steadied off around 90-100. He called for EMTs on duty to come over with a stretcher because he thought I should be laid flat. The EMT took my blood pressure and it was 155/94. The doctor said at one point my pulse was thready. By this point the dizziness was stronger and I felt tingly in my teeth as well as other areas. I was asked about my breathing and I said that it was okay. An ambulance was called for and arrived. I don&#39;t remember the exact time. The moved me from the wheelchair to a stretcher. I could not stand up on my own and lurched toward the stretcher. I am grateful strong people were there to get me on stretcher and strapped in. All throughout this my normally barely noticeable Atrial Fibrillation was quite apparent and more erratic. This was a major reason for ambulance call. Some of the stroke protocol was done including gripping EMT&#39;s fingers equally and following his finger with my eyes. I was very cold throughout. I was brought to the waiting ambulance outside and driven to Medical Center. The EMT took an EKG which showed atrial fibrillation and a line was put into my arm.  When we got to the hospital, I was brought into the triage area and had all my vitals taken. Blood pressure was high, so was pulse then for a half hour, I was very hot and sweated a lot after being cold.

                                                12 hours after the second Covid 19 injection I got a severe debilitating migraine with chills. The migraine was the worst I have ever had in my life. It lasted for 10 hours. I have had migraine throughout my life but nothing this severe. I took Tylenol and used cold compress on my forehead.

It?s now been 2&#43; weeks and is fading, leaving me with mild burning and itching in same area.   I went ahead and had 2cd dose on 1/7/21.    FYI:    I?m an Emergency Physician myself.

A 63-years-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Dec2020 14:40, at a single dose for Covid 19. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has no prior vaccinations -within 4 weeks. The patient is an EEG technician. On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine. He mentioned that he was tested for COVID 19 on 18Dec2020 and the result was inconclusive. He went again 23Dec2020 they called him on 25Dec2020 and informed he was positive per the PCR test. He treated himself with 500mg acetaminophen (UPC 0904672059; lot OBE2896 and expiration Oct2021) and azithromycin Z-Pack (NDC 65862-641-69; Lot ZYSA20012-A; and expiration date Mar2022). The sample of the product is not available to be returned. Predisposing factor was that the patient&#39;s wife was at home and was sick too at the same time. She was tested Sunday with no results yet. The outcome of the events of fever recovered on 28Dec2020, sluggishness recovered on 29Dec2020, pain all over the body was recovered on 02Jan2021; running to the bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine and heart pounding were recovered on 24Dec2020, weight loss was not recovered, and for other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (4 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / SARS-CoV-2 test positive) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded

Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

                                                Morning after  Could not go to work  And I have worked 30 years without one sick day. Low grade fever in am with shaking but not cold. Started around 6 AM by 9 AM couldn&#39;t stand  very weak  slightly lightheaded    Threw up till almost choking.  At noon my temp hit  103.7   Took tylenol all AM and wasn&#39;t lowering temp.  That was the highest temp  Then gradually began to  come down   At 5:00 PM temp at 100 and able to put soup down.  Woke up  4 AM next day in  total sweat that had to move to other side of bed  Soaked but felt OK   On 23rd  Got headache above right eye to side of frontal lobe,   Not any strong headache at all   Dull  Like a 2 out of 10.  My concern is I still have the exact same headache as I did three weeks ago  Not a smidgen lower at all  SAME.  And I booked second vaccine for Sat 2/27th    I am concerned as I have heard second can be worse.   I have never had the flu and this was my first ever vaccine of any kind    Please advise

                                                The vaccine was given in the left arm. The left arm began to tingle and get heavy as expected.  However, during the 15 minute waiting period after receiving the vaccine, the left side of my face began to feel ever so slightly thick and numb. It felt as if I had been to the dentist for a filling a hours ago.  I never lost speech or had a discernable facial deformity, but the numbing caught me off guard.   The facial feeling faded in about the same manner as the arm recovery.

                                                I started to develop a headache and became a little nauseous right after. After two days, my fingers started swelling and hurting. I couldn&#39;t make a fist. It caused my immune system to go crazy. That lasted about 5 days. After taking Aleve and Tylenol, it helped reduce the pain. My kidney doctor told me to stop taking Aleve because it was interacting with my BP meds. The doctor from Northwest Arthritis prescribed Tramadol to help with pain. I still have pain, but it&#39;s tolerable.

He&#39;s reporting adverse events and would like to know: If he takes Tylenol to treat his symptoms, would it decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine or not. Also, if he were to go for a COVID-19 viral test, would the fact that he was received the vaccine interact with the test and cause a false positive result or not. Patient was reporting that yesterday, day 4, he started with body aches, headache, and &#34;when he got in bed, he had chills and shivers real bad, little chilly&#34; so possibly a mild fever. Enquired could these all be side effects of the vaccine or not. If he go for the COVID test - would it be positive or not. He also states he has a history of asthma and has been hypervigilant about avoiding COVID infections. Caller, reporting on the COVID vaccine and who explains that he got the first shot on Monday and he had a mildly sore arm- this lasted 2-3 days, no big deal. Then 5 days later he had really bad body aches and a headache. He went to bed cause he was feeling worse but before going to bed he noticed he had shivers really bad, uncontrollably almost which lasted over an hour. He presume they are fairly normal side effects but wants to confirm this could happen after five days. Also, he was told not to take Aspirin or Tylenol before getting the vaccine because it could affect the efficacy, but he wants to know could he take a Tylenol now 5 days later for the headache and body aches. He was better now than he was doing. Caller clarified the event was 4 days after the shot, the shot was Monday and events started Thursday. On Thursday evening, 11Feb2021, was when he had the bad body aches, headache, and shivers. At this point he still has the headache and body ache.

                                                I was engaged in moderate physical activity for about 2 hours when I suddenly became very weak. I stopped working and took a shower. Within an hour I started having severe cramping around my chest and torso that last about 24 hours. Since the second day, I haven?t been able to  be active without starting to sweat and suddenly feeling weak and having to sit down. Even repotting a plant this morning started symptoms in minutes. I also have been experiencing dehydration since the day of the injection.

                                                About 18 hours after my 2nd Covid vaccine I had trouble swallowing, The liquid would come out the left side of my mouth and I couldn&#39;t control it. The next day my left eye hurt and would not stop watering. Yesterday it was worse, I had a crooked smile and more severe eye pain and watering, Went to Urgent Care and after ruling out a stroke I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsey.  I have not been diagnosed with Bell&#39;s in the past.

I had to hold onto furniture as I made my way across the room.  After this continued for several hours, I did some research on the web and was led to believe that being dizzy was a serious event.  At 7:11 PM, I got a ride to the hospital and checked into the emergency room.  I was there at the hospital for about 30 minutes and noticed that the dizzy feeling was gone.  I walked out of the hospital without every going back to an examination room.  I caught a ride home at 8:08 PM.  Note that the only other adverse event was a sore arm and a vague feeling of not being well.

Symptoms started at 1:36 pm while walking to catch train. Pt noted numbness and felt light headed. Pt had mild headache that he associated with not eating much. Pt returned back to urgent care because of symptoms and RR team called.    Pt had given blood for tests (12 vials) and abdominal ultrasound earlier in the morning as work up for his chronic renal insufficiency. Pt drank several cups of water before the ultrasound.  Symptoms initially improved but did not resolve, so he was sent to ER for stroke. Pt had 3 more episodes of worsening left sided numbness and lost consciousness on 2 of those occasions per the patient. Neurology evaluated patient and said that they were likely thalamic strokes. Pt was unable to have an MRI because of metal in his eye.

A 63-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 08Mar2021 at 15:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux. The patient has no known allergies and has no COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included omeprazole, naproxen, and calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium trisilicate (TUMS). The patient has no other vaccine in 4 weeks. The side effects started the day after the shot, on 09Mar2021 at 05:00, the patient reported that his arm was sore, and he was having mild headache that lasted throughout the day. Two days later (as reported), he woke up with headache and blood-filled right eye. After being seen in the ER, at the advice of his primary doctor, they sent him to a retinal and macular surgeon. His eye was diagnosed with hemorrhaging and he was prescribed a medication. The patient has follow-up visits scheduled to check on the progress of his eye. He was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the events and included treatment with prednisone. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Patient reports his symptoms started on Saturday and failed to improve.  He contacted his PCP and he was recommended to go to the ER for evaluation.  Patient had his COVID-19 vaccine-1st dose 2 weeks prior and was concerned that he might be having 1 of the rare side effects from the vaccine. On admission patient had normal vitals.  His labs were within normal limits.  Patient&#39;s presentation was discussed with Neurology who recommended admission for stroke workup given his comorbidities-hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and obesity.  Patient received 1 dose of prednisone 80 mg in the emergency department for treatment of Bell&#39;s palsy (patient&#39;s symptoms more consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy presentation).  Patient was admitted to medicine service for workup of stroke with MRI brain without contrast and monitoring for any worsening of neurological symptoms.  Patient&#39;s CT head on admission was negative for any acute abnormality.  CTA head and neck showed near occlusion of intracranial left vertebral artery.  MRI brain without contrast was negative for acute infarct.  Patient&#39;s facial paralysis slightly improved with 1 dose of 80 mg prednisone.  Patient&#39;s presentation was consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy.  Patient worked with PT OT and speech therapy and was recommended outpatient physical therapy and speech therapy.  He was discharged home in stable condition on oral prednisone 80 mg daily for 7 days and valacyclovir 1000 mg 3 times a day for 7 days.  Patient was recommended to follow-up with Ophthalmology as outpatient for possible left eye patch if his symptoms fail to improve.  Patient&#39;s Lipitor dose was increased to 40 mg daily from 10 mg daily due to finding of atherosclerotic changes on CT head and neck. Active Issues Requiring Follow-up Issue:  Bell&#39;s palsy and abnormal finding on CT head and neck. Recommended follow-up provider/specialty:  PCP What is needed: 1. Referral to Ophthalmology for an eye patch if symptoms fail to improve. 2. Referral to neurovascular surgery for CT head and neck findings.    63-year-old male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus admitted for workup of stroke-like symptoms.         * Stroke-like symptoms Assessment &amp; Plan Patient presented with left-sided facial droop, left forehead droop and slurred speech. - CT head on admission showed no acute intracranial process. - CTA head and Neck shows near occlusion of intracranial left vertebral artery.  Patient reports his symptoms started 3 days ago. Patient&#39;s presentation appears similar to Bell&#39;s palsy.  He received 80 mg of prednisone in the emergency department.  Patient&#39;s symptoms were discussed with stroke Neurology who recommended MRI brain without contrast to rule out possible stroke given his underlying comorbidities-hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity. Plan: - will obtain MRI brain w/o contrast. - Check A1c and Lipid profile - continue Aspirin and statin. - monitor on tele - Neurochecks q4h     Bell&#39;s palsy Assessment &amp; Plan Patient has loss of left forehead wrinkles, left eyelid droop, droop of his left corner of the mouth. Patient&#39;s presentation more consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy. Patient reports that he had COVID 19 vaccine 2 weeks prior to developing symptoms and read it as one of the rare side effects online.  Patient received one dose of Prednisone 80 mg in the ED. Will continue with Prednisone taper until MRI results are back.  SLP ordered.  Patient advised on following with ophthalmology for eye patch.

                                                Patient suffered a stroke 6 days after receiving the 1st dose of his Pfizer vaccine.  He initially developed left arm numbness and tingling which prompted admission to ER.   Later that same day, he had significant worsening with left hemiparesis.    MRI demonstrated right hemispheric ischemic stroke and focal right carotid ruptured plaque.    Somewhat unusual given his overall good health and lack of risk factors.    Has never smoked, exercises regularly and carotid duplex performed in 2017 demonstrated less than 50% right internal carotid artery stenosis.   Takes aspirin daily.     Currently remains hospitalized with significant left upper extremity paresis.  Minimal left leg function.  Did require carotid endarterectomy.  The plaque rupture was focal and hemorrhagic with no significant evidence atherosclerotic plaque beyond the focal ruptured plaque.

After a couple days I called my vascular team and they took me into surgery immediately. They did some kind of pharm treatment to break up the clot. Had procedure everyday for 3 days where they ultimately used some balloon device to open up the artery again. Still monitoring, am scheduled for another follow-up next week. I&#39;m still vertical, but they had said the leg itself might be in jeopardy. Not happy with Pfizer, that&#39;s for sure.

I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

                                                64-year-old male who presented to the clinic with complaints of left-sided weakness on his face. He stated when he woke up this morning he noticed that the left side of his mouth drooped and that he could not close his left eye all the way. Yesterday he felt fine. Today he went to work. Patient stated that on 12/18 he got the COVID vaccine. It was on a Friday. The following day he had a headache and he felt flu-like. He stated that those symptoms resolved quickly. He then had the facial weakness today (11 days after the vacciantion). He has not had any fever, sweats, or chills. Patient stated that he had called ask a nurse, and he was advised to hang up and call 911 and go to the emergency room. However, he stated he was an EMT and did not feel that was necessary. He denies headache. He has not had any vision change. He has been eating and drinking well without any difficulty.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General appearance - patient was not in any distress. He was conversant, pleasant and appropriate. HEENT - normal conjunctivae and lids. Sclerae anicteric. Pupils equal and reactive to light. Patient was not able to close his left eyelid. Normal ear canals. TMs are pearly gray with bright light reflex. Neck - supple. No lymphadenopathy. Skin - pink, warm and dry. Neuro - alert and oriented. Deep tendon reflexes 2&#43; upper and lower extremities with no focal weakness. Normal range of motion. Patient can raise his right eyebrow. Could not raise his left eyebrow. There was impaired eyelid closure on the left; tight closure on the right. Smiling of the face revealed lateralization to the right side. When frowning, he had upper and lower facial paralysis on the left with flattening of the forehead. The patient could not tighten the left side of his mouth.   ASSESSMENT: Bell&#39;s palsy.   PLAN: Discussed pathophysiology of Bell&#39;s palsy. Advised patient I recommended him to call the number that he got with the information when he received his COVID vaccine. Advised patient that I could not definitively correlate the Bell&#39;s palsy with the COVID immunization, but that he can call the number he has to let them know of his symptoms. Discussed treatment options. Since patient woke up with his symptoms this morning, I advised patient that he would have hopefully the best outcome because he would be able to get on the steroid and antiviral soon after developing the symptoms. He is to wear an eye patch to prevent corneal drying or abrasion of the left eye at night. Using Lacri-Lube at night before placing the eye patch and then following up by using artificial tears during the day.   Patient was placed on prednisone 60 mg once a day for 1 week to be taken with food. Valtrex 1,000 mg 3 times a day for 1 week.   Side effects of medication discussed. Handouts were provided. He will follow up with PCP if any changes or concerns. Advised patient that it may take up to 3 weeks before all his symptoms have resolved

                                                I took my nightly statin pill about 6 hours after receiving my 1st vaccination shot and went to bed.  About 4 hours later, I woke from a sound sleep with the most painful cramps in both lower legs that I&#39;ve ever experienced.  Both feet were flexing upwards and my lower calf muscles taught uncontrollably.  I managed to get out of bed and onto my feet to put my weight on them; but had to balance on a nearby chair.  Only after an intensely painful 45 minutes did the muscles begin to relax!! (When first prescribed statins 10 years ago, I found they particularly could cause a cramp in one of my legs at night.  Only after trying several varieties of statins and lower doses did I find one --the generic Pravastatin-- and dose that would not trigger this nighttime cramping.  In further defense, I also try to stay hydrated and drink a glass of water before going to bed each night.) *NOTE: In order to avoid that incredible pain, I DO NOT plan to take my statin pill the night when I get my 2nd dose!!

                                                Stroke. 48 hours after second vaccination.  Because we thought his symptoms were just a result of the vaccine (extreme weakness in his legs, slurring of his words) we did not rush him to the ER as we should have. He is home from the hospital now. We are lining up physical and occupational therapy.

                                                ptosis of right eye; leg pain (both legs); This is a spontaneous report from a consumer. A 64 years old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6208) as SINGLE DOSE (at age of 64 years old) for covid-19 immunisation.

Historical vaccine information included  BNT162B2, dose 1 on 28Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6205) dose 1, for covid-19 immunization at age of 63 years old. He received second dose on 18Mar2021; 30 days later 18Apr2021 woke up at 5 A.M., noticed ptosis of right eye on 18Apr2021. Concerned she took him to the hospital where he was assessed for stroke, TIA, all tests were negative. Consumer states, &#34;my fiance was hospitalized over the weekend, we do feel it was exactly 30 days after second dose of Pfizer dose, from what I read in medical articles. I see that there were some cases of Palsy experienced by people in clinical trial. He is currently at home. He was in the hospital (emergency room)from 7am on 18Apr2021 and left at 3:50pm that same day against medical advise due to they did not have a neurologist. They wanted to admit him and transfer him to another facility because they didn&#39;t have a neurologist available. She clarified her fiance&#39;s adverse event as ptosis of his right eye.  She said her fiance had diagnostics and blood work performed while at the Emergency Room. She said she wasn&#39;t positive if the blood work performed was a CBC and basic blood chemistry, but the blood work results were normal. She said the hospital she brought her fiance to did not have a neurologist on staff. She said the hospital wanted to admit and transfer her fiance to a specialized hospital with a neurologist on the premises. She said her fiance&#39;s condition did not worsen while at the Emergency Room, but she felt her fiance was not being monitored closely, and was not getting any care. She said since her fiance was not receiving anything at the Emergency Room, and the Emergency Room didn&#39;t have the bandwidth to address his issues, and nothing was done to transport him to another hospital, her fiance left the Emergency Room against medical advice (AMA). She said her fiance went to a neurologist on Monday (19Apr2021). Emergency Room Visit Treatment: Stated her fiance was given Oxycodone while at the Emergency Room. She said she did not know the Oxycodone dose, NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. She said the Oxycodone was administered for leg pain (both legs) caused by a pre-existing condition her fiance had. She said her fiance normally took Ropinirole for his leg pain. Consumer reported her fiance had follow-up testing done at the neurologist on Monday (19Apr2021), and was waiting for the test results to come back. She clarified the neurologist was doing the follow-up testing to confirm or rule-out a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. Consumer reported when she took her fiance to the Emergency room she thought he was going to be assessed for a possible TIA or stroke, but when it was mentioned her fiance may have Myasthenia Gravis, it was equally concerning. Neurologist Visit Treatment: She stated the neurologist prescribed Pyridostigmine 60mg on Monday (19Apr2021) for her fiance to start taking while the doctor waited for the blood work and repetitive nerve conduction study results to come back. She said the doctor&#39;s logic was to take the Pyridostigmine 60mg, and see if the ptosis resolved, and if the ptosis resolved the doctor would know the cause of the ptosis. She said her fiance&#39;s right eye ptosis had not improved, changed, or resolved since he started taking the Pyridostigmine 60mg. She said she did not have the Pyridostigmine 60mg NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included  blood gases (ABG): unknown on 18Apr2021, Vital capacity: normal  on 18Apr2021, Blood test: unknown on 18Apr2021, COVID-19: negative on 18Apr2021; vital signs measurement: normal on 18Apr2021 . Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of ptosis of right eye. Outcome of the event ptosis of right eye was not recovered. Outcome of the event leg pain (both legs) was unknown.

                                                occipital neuralgia; left-side Bells Palsy; bilateral headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (Lot/batch number and Expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration at right deltoid on 21Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included low high density lipoprotein (HDL). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (longer than 4 weeks ago, and he did not have any reaction), pravastatin for low HDL. Reported 2 days ago (02Jan2021) he developed a bilateral headache. He stated he was asymptomatic until then. He said he now has Bells Palsy on 02Jan2021, clarified he has left-side Bells Palsy. He said it is unknown to him if the bilateral headache and Bells Palsy are related to taking the COVID-19 Vaccine. He stated he started wearing a N95 mask for the past 2 weeks. He said the N95 mask is very tight on the back of his head. He said he believes he is experiencing occipital neuralgia caused by wearing the N95 mask. He said studies show that the N95 mask can cause Bells Palsy, and the N95 mask maybe a confounding factor. He stated he doesn&#39;t have any further information on the N95 mask he was using. Initially he had a severe headache and administered to himself a sphenopalatine block of Lidocaine 1% in his nose. He stated being an ER doctor, he knows how to administer the sphenopalatine block to a patient. He went to the ER on 03Jan2021 to make sure he did not have a tumor or a stroke. He said the hospital performed a CT of his head, a MRA, labs, and a COVID-19 test (clarified as a PCR COVID-19 test) with a full viral count. He said all the tests were negative. His wife noticed his Bells Palsy yesterday, 03Jan2021. He said he thinks the Bells Palsy started the night before on 02Jan2021. He said he noticed on the night of 02Jan2021 when he was brushing his teeth, he hit a tooth on that side (clarified as left side) of his mouth with his tooth brush. He hasn&#39;t started taking steroids yet, but will be starting steroids real soon. He clarified his doctor prescribed a Medrol dose pack and Valtrex for the Bells Palsy. He stated he has not started the Medrol dose pack and Valtrex. He is ordering Lidocaine 1% viscous for himself, so he can do an internasal sphenopalatine block on himself. He does not know if the bilateral headache and Bells Palsy were caused by taking the COVID-19 Vaccine. The events required Emergency Room visit. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered,  Headache was recovering, Occipital neuralgia was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162b2 and the onset of Bell&#39;s palsy/Headache might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

                                                Right before the shot, patient seemed out of it. Do not know if that is how he is on a day to day basis. He could answer questions from the nurses but would respond really slowly. He received the shot on his right arm then he went to stand in the nurse window. Around 10 minutes later, we heard a thud and glass fall down and saw that he had fallen on the floor. His eyes were open and he was responsive. He had the same slow demeaner. He said that his legs felt weak so he fell. The paramedics were called and the staff nurse told them that he had fallen about 10 days ago. He had no issues with his first Covid dose. The paramedics took him to the nearest hospital.

                                                Patient received his first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/3/21. Patient was conscious with no apparent issues after administration. Patient was asked to sit down for 15-minute observation afterwards. A few minutes later patient was swaying back and forth in his chair and saying he was feeling faint. I repeatedly addressed patient by his first name and asked if he could hear me and repeatedly asked if he was okay. Patient began slumping down in his chair but was still conscious. Patient was not responsive but made eye contact with me. Patient requested water. After giving patient water and observing him drink he began looking nauseous and threw up. Patient then passed out in his chair. I supported the patient upright in his chair and made sure he did not fall down or injure his head. I then immediately tapped him on both shoulders and repeatedly called his name. Patient then became responsive and 911 was called. While waiting patient said he was starting to feel better and was able to support himself in his chair. I did not observe any injuries due to fainting. When the ambulance came patient agreed to be taken to the hospital.

Tried lying on back, side, with pillows under legs, on floor with legs up on a chair. Have never had sciatica issue before. Patient experienced all reported events on 28Jan2021 at 19:30. The patient asked what can be done to eliminate the pain. Patient had no COVID prior vaccination, and was not COVID tested post vaccination. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                One week after getting the first Pfizer vaccine, my superficial vein thrombosis returned with a vengeance. I had gotten the vein ablation treatment several years ago for varicose veins, and the problems I had went away, but one week after the first shot, my calf muscle was swollen and felt sore and aching, and the rest of the leg was in pain, just like it was before getting the vein operation. The varicose veins returned and my leg now has prominent black and blue areas on it, like it had before my surgery. I&#39;m returning to the vein clinic in two weeks for them to look at it. My leg still hurts.   I should also add that my arm is still sore where they gave me the shot. My strength has not yet fully returned, even though I work out in the gym regularly.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at 2pm today, 3/10/2021. Approximately 10 minutes after the vaccine he became diaphoretic and weak.  He was asked if he had any reaction to any vaccines and he stated no.  Since a temperature was not able to be detected on the digital thermometer and a pulse was barely detected, I administered 2 doses of epinephrine (Epipen) 10 minutes apart.   The physician came to attend to the patient as well as nurses and the EMS.  He was taken to the ED for observation.  Prior to his departure to the ED, patient had normal O2 sats and a normal blood pressure.

On 24Jan2021, he was also diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy which was still ongoing at the time of report. The patient stated that he just got out of the inpatient rehab center on 03Mar2021. At the time of follow-up report (04Mar2021), he stated that he feels better but it is not recovered yet. The patient had undergone laboratory tests and procedures on 20Jan2021 which includes: Blood test: normal, Urine test: normal, CR Protein: elevated, Covid19 test: negative, CT (computer tomography) Scan: normal, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): normal. It was reported that adverse event Guillain Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant required visit to ER. The patient was hospitalized for Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant from 20Jan2021 to 03Mar2021. The patient received treatment for Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant, while he did not receive any treatment for Bell&#39;s palsy. Outcome of the event Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant was recovering, while outcome of Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered.   Information on batch/lot number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, a possible contribution of the drug to the events  Guillian Barre Syndrome with Miller Fisher variant and Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be excluded.

Pt&#39;s sister called the next morning and reported that he sounded terrible. He was strugging to breathe and was SOB. His sister went over to his house to check on him and wanted to take him to the doctor&#39;s office or the hospital. Pt refused at that time. Pt agreed to make a doctor appointment for later in the afternoon. Sister left at noon. She stated her brother had made a doctor appointment for 4:00 at Family Practice. Upon arriving, pt started walking towards the entrance and became SOB. His significant other asked the doctor&#39;s office for a  wheelchair and was denied.

Ear and Face were swollen, warm to touch, painful and could not hear.  I am still having difficulty hearing in that ear (3-25-2021), sounds like liquid in that ear.  I called a tele doc service on Sunday, 02/14/2021, they prescribed Amoxicillin -Clav.  Temperature and swelling went away, still having difficulty hearing in that ear.

I wasn&#39;t aware of any changes in my tinnitus after the 1st vaccine. But after the 2nd vaccine I noticed a definite profound increase in my tinnitus. It is now on the verge of being debilitating in nature. It is now  pulsating and much louder, very difficult to ignore even during day time activities. Before my tinnitus was bilaterally equal, now I would say my right ear is louder than my left. But both are louder than before. Today marks about 50 days since 2nd vaccine, and I think its actually getting progressively worse! Hopefully this is not permanent.

The wife states as soon as the pt woke up he was altered mainly acting confused and not speaking normally. She also states that his side of the bed was wet this am but is unsure if it was sweat or urine. LKW 2200 last night before the pt went to bed. Upon EMS arrival the pt was sitting on the floor, playing with a toilet brush, and speaking non-sense. While en route to the ED the pt reportedly had convulsive seizure like activity and was non-responsive 15-20min following the activity. He is now awake but not verbally responsive and still acting confused. No hx of seizures per wife. Hx otherwise limited as pt is non-verbal at this time

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 22Mar2021 between 09:00-10:00 (Lot Number: EP6955) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history, no family medical history relevant to adverse events.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient felt soreness in the arm and it made him sleepy after the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the evening of 22Mar2021. When he got back home the same day 22Mar2021 sleepiness began. The patient stated this was probably going to happen anyway, he was disabled and had a bad back and stuff on an unspecified date.  The patient had to drive 30 some miles, 31 miles to be exact to see the doctor to receive the Pfizer Covid Vaccination.  When he returned from the trip he was tired and would go to sleep anyway on 22Mar2021.  The patient stated soreness in the arm had been gone for maybe 3 or 4 days, he was good, no problem with arm, and sleepiness went away. The patient mentioned that he had tons of ills on unspecified date because of the shot. The patient was not experiencing any of this before having the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. The events did not require a visit to Emergency room or Physician office. There were no relevant tests.  The outcome of events felt soreness in the arm and Sleepiness was recovered, and of the other events was unknown.

                                                Starting about 16 hours post-injection, left arm was becoming very sore and painful to move.. almost 24 hours post-injection I started getting strong chills. I was shivering and chattering on the walk out to the car (it was 30 degrees outside). When I got home, even though it was New Year&#39;s Eve, I put a light jacket on and sat in my cozy chair most of the evening, celebrated New Year&#39;s with the family, then I had to put on flannel pajamas in order to be warm enough to sleep. I usually don&#39;t have to wear pajamas to bed. And for most of New Year&#39;s Day I kept the pajamas on and a light jacket and I was in my chair most of the day trying not to shiver. The shivering finally stopped late on the First, about 54 hours post-injection. And over the weekend the pain in my arm slowly went away, and by now, one week post-injection, I feel no pain in my arm at all.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

He was at the VA yesterday for some other business and they told him the shot was available to him so he had it. He is planning to get the second dose on 02Feb2021. He used to take blood thinners and he imagines, like with the blood thinners, that they wouldn&#39;t want him to stack Tylenol on top of the vaccine. He has a few aches and his back is bothering him; which is normal for him; but he would like to know if he can take Tylenol for his back. He noticed some soreness in his arm, a little, when he got home two or three hours later. His sister said to rub it to disperse the medication, so he did. Adds it is not a big deal. Recently he has not been sleeping well; which is also normal for him; so today he slept in; he may have slept too long on his back but his back is aching and he wanted to take some Tylenol for his back. The patient experienced some soreness in his arm on 12Jan2021 with outcome of recovering , back ache on 13Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Treatment received for the event. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

This went away after a few hours but when it started I thought of Bell&#39;s Palsy.  - Later my arm got extremely sore at the site of the injection it still hurts and in a large area of the arm 5 days later - Painful area below the left armpit and in an area about 3 inches in diameter (area of the lymph node). Still have pain although less after 4 days.

They felt he could have had a TIA, or extension of a prior CVA (nothing new on MRI, has small vessel ischemic disease), or a COVID vaccine reaction. Symptoms have mostly resolved, he is not always cooperative so subtle weakness is difficult to detect. He was hospitalizaed, started on ASA &amp; increased BP meds, and returned to his home, where he has resided for several years.

Wife then stopped vehicle in Lane #6 halfway down to observation and called for help from observation staff. Upon arrival of observation staff pt was found to be unresponsive but still had a pulse and was breathing on his own. Pt was in the passenger set. Observation staff alerted onsite medical professionals and MD and the crash cart was brought to the car. Vitals were taken. Within a minute pt became responsive and opened his eyes and began to communicate with healthcare staff. O2 sat was noted to be low so O2 was applied at 6L/min via facemask. Onsite Batallion Chief stated he had already called EMS and they were en route. MD remained at the vehicle with pt and continued to monitor until EMS arrived and assumed care. EMS  did an EKG and pt found to have sinus brady, with a pulse in the 50&#39;s. EMS decided to transport pt to hospital for further evaluation. Pt transported to ambulance via stretcher in stable condition, alert.

It went from moderate annoyance, having to go to relief myself 2-3 times a night, to  complete  retention.   Was near point of going to ER, but Ibuprofen seems to work to help something come out -- although limited.  Tried Flomax for first time, (had prescription for if needed), but the Ibuprofen seems to help best. Makes me suspect inflammation from the vaccine. Other than that possibility, only reaction to the vaccine was a sore arm for a couple days.

                                                On 02/12/2021 around 11:00am I was assigned to have Covid 19 shot at the table#6. At that time I saw the Vaccine was already in the syringe which was in the plastic bag with zipper. Ten days after the shot I felt well, no pain nor swell on my left shoulder. But in the morning of 02/23/2021 after waking up I started to feel hurt to my left arm and the pain was transmitted to the left of my back (left lung). During these 3 days 23,24,25 my pain reached the maximum intensity 10/10 even I took 3 times a day Ibuprofen which was each time 2x200mg. On 02/26/2021 I went to Hospital in the Emergency Unit and after diagnosis the Doctors found that I had 3 heart arteries clog-up. How can I be sure that the liquid in the syringe is the Pfizer Vaccine or something else? I used to see the TVs broadcast on the Covid 19 shot that the nurse inserts the syringe in the small Pzifer bottle, suck the Vaccine into syringe and inject  the vaccine into the shoulder of the patient. Can CDC require that all Covid 19 providers show the vaccine to all patients before the shot? In 2017 I had an Angiogram and my 3 bypasses were not clogged why they are all clogged now? I don&#39;t change my every day diet and I&#39;m very careful with eating fat, cholesterol and salt in my everyday food.

                                                Gradually progressive peripheral neuropathy in toes then fingers.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 66-year-old male patient received the first dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EK9231) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 10Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation, (HTN) hypertension, obesity, intermittent asthma, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS), atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN), losartan (LOSARTAN), dutasteride, and tamsulosin hydrochloride (JALYN). The patient experienced gradually progressive peripheral neuropathy in toes then fingers on 18Jan2021. No treatment received. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The second dose was administered on 31Jan2021 at 9am (lot number: EL9262) in right arm. Patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19 prior to vaccination. Patient has not been tested for Covid-19 after vaccination. Outcome of the event was not recovered.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible temporal association, the reasonable possibility that the reported progressive peripheral neuropathy in toes then fingers (Neuropathy peripheral), occurred 8 days after the first dose,  is related to BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I went to the car, was being driven home, and about 20 minutes after the vaccination I developed an odd sweet/metallic taste in my mouth, followed by increased saliva, some difficulty swallowing, nasal congestion, and some chest discomfort. They symptoms were already getting a little better by the time we got home (about 30 minutes after the shot), but I took a Benadryl and the symptoms resolved within 2 hours. After that I just had the expected arm pain and fatigue until the next morning. Since then I have been fine.

                                                My wife &amp; I are unsure if what we both are experiencing is just coincidental or actually the cause as a result of the 2nd dose shots we both received but we are both experiencing similar events approximately a week&#43; after the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Her information is as follows: Pt age 64, same address &amp; contact information as listed for myself, 1st Pfizer dose 2/6/21 EL9264, 2nd dose 3/1/21 EN6202. We had no immediate event after both shots except for soreness in upper arms at injection sight and this ceased after approximately a day. But as mentioned at a week&#43; of 2nd dose we both started having a severe aching pain. Her pain is in her right knee. My aching pain is in my right hip down my leg to my knee &amp; chin/calf area. It was very difficult to put weight on the leg to walk. We have been icing the areas and taking pain over the counter medication Aleve which has helped somewhat but we are still experiencing as of the date of this submission.  It seems strange we both are experiencing similar issue at approximately the same time.  Coincidence?  Due to reaction to the vaccine?  We are submitting this report to see if it might be and if others have experienced this issue. We are unaware of any physical activity  we may have done during this time to have caused this pain to start occurring. Thank you for any response.

                                                I had the Pfizer vaccine in my left arm on Jan. 23rd. I had no side effects at the time, other than a sore arm, as with any shot. However, two days later I lost all hearing in my left ear. I had no history of ear infections or other ear or hearing problems, except for wax buildup two or three times. On Jan. 26th, I saw an ENT. To my dismay, there was no wax. He prescribed the standard treatment of Prednisone for Sudden Idiopathic Hearing Loss. No change after the first round, so I had a second round, and also had the series of three ear injections with Dexamethasone. Had an MRI, as well, which was normal. A couple of weeks into all this, I began to have a bit of sound-generated static in my ear, and this continues today. (Fortunately, I?ve only had the most minor of tinnitus in that ear, and even it is pretty much gone now.)

                                                Anxiety. Severe concern about how I felt at the moment, lying in bed. Started at about 2:30 am. An electric feeling. Hard to describe. I thought I might be having a heart attack. It happened several times, resolving to a normal state after 40 min or so, being ok for maybe 1/2 an hour then returning. After 3 or 4 worrisome crescendos, I decided to go to the Emergency Room at 4:30 am. Observed there, released with analysis being it was anxiety, not a heart problem.

Next day pain was increased and range of motion declined. By Friday, March 12th I could not raise arm more than 6 inches. Went to the Dr. on 3/12/21 and was referred to the Orthopaedics. Saw PA on 3/12/21. Xrays were taken I believe the diagnosis is in part subacromial bursitis.. Received Cortisone shot. Range of motion was much improved and has stayed about the same through today. Iced shoulder last night because of mild pain. Woke up in considerable pain which has continued today. I have iced the shoulder and upper arm at other times also since 3/10/21.

                                                After first shot I had a sore arm for three days, I was tired for about 36 hours, then nothing, about four days after the vaccine I began to get tingling sensations in my head, mainly back and side only lasting a few seconds and sometimes with this sensation I get an over all body feeling of coldness that lasts a few seconds. I spoke with my PC Dr. he thinks because of my headache history that maybe the head tingling sensations are due to headaches/ migraines, but he thought it would be good to report these sensations in case there may be a connection to the vaccine, I am scheduled to get my second shot on 03-24-2021 I am not saying it was the vaccine, maybe something else but to be safe I wanted to report this strange sensation after getting the first shot. Maybe see if other people had the same or similar sensations. Any advice would be appreciated . Thank you

                                                Intense pain in lower back and neck in and around where I have mild disc degeneration.  The pain is right where the affected discs are located and radiates outward.  Symptoms began 18 - 20 hours following the vaccine, and became much worse over the next 24 hours.  I also had suddenly had an elevated body temperature and broke out in a sweat in the middle of the night (about 36 hours following shot).  That lasted only 10-15 minutes and then went away on it&#39;s own.   I had the exact same experience following the first shot (2/23/2021, Pfizer Lot #6201).  The symptoms were odd, and I didn&#39;t realize at the time that it might have been connected to the vaccine, so I didn&#39;t report it.  After receiving the second shot and having the same symptoms with the same timeline, it seems that it is likely a reaction to the vaccine.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

                                                One week after receiving second dose, my bilateral forearm/hand, bilateral lower leg/foot, and sensory neuropathic cough worsened moderately.  The paroxysmal cough had been mild for the last year not requiring medication.  I had tapered off gabapentin for all symptoms a year ago, but now restarted taking it to control the cough.  This possibly autoimmune neuropathy began 3 years ago after a trip out of country with a few mosquito bites just about 11 days before neuropathy began.  No cause ever identified and it was thought to be either a viral-induced or autoimmune process.  The symptoms slowly abated over the last 3 years until this last 12 days after receiving the second Pfizer vaccine.  Not sure if a relationship, but it is quite a coincidence when the neuropathy had almost resolved for the 6 months beforehand.   The first vaccine dose was uneventful other than a sore arm and chills for a couple days.  The second dose was even less eventful.

I could hardly sleep all night from pain and aches. The next morning I had a hard time using my legs and could hardly lift anything, that lasted all day wednesday into thursday. Thursday the pain lessened and the weakness became less but I started getting pain in my hips and  heavy painful bloating feeling in my intestinal area. That lasted all day and into Friday (today). Today (Friday) the pain in my arms subsided, legs got  better (no pain but still weak) but the intestinal issues are keeping me incapacitated and the top of my hips ache.

A 66-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number was not provided, expiration date: Jun2021) at the age of 66-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, high triglycerides, and allergy to beef product. Concomitant medication included lisinopril and ongoing unspecified medications. He did not have any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was administered with COVID vaccine in a pharmacy or drug store. The reporter stated that they read quite a bit about Bell&#39;s palsy affecting some people after the second COVID shot but the patient experienced Bell&#39;s palsy after his first COVID shot on 04Mar2021 at 06:00 and it was still affecting him, his lip was still paralyzed. This required a physician office visit and the patient was treated with an antiviral drug that did not work therefore he was prescribed prednisone on 14Mar2021. He is supposed to get his second COVID shot on Saturday, they were concerned as far as to whether it was safe for him to get the other shot. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included triglycerides which were high on an unspecified date; and blood sugar on an unspecified date and blood work for diabetes on 03Mar2021, both with unknown results. The outcome of the event was not recovered.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested

A 66-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 at the age of 66-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm (reported also as left shoulder) on 08Mar2021 12:45 (Lot Number: EN6199) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On 11Mar2021 (reported as 3 days after the vaccination), the patient experienced neuropathy in left hand (pinky and ring finger) which consists of numbness and parasthesias. The patient took aspirin with no effect. As of 11Mar2021, the event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information is limited and does not allow a full medical assessment. Considering temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the onset of neuropathy, cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I assumed it was just temporary and didn&#39;t mention it.  But it has continued off and on since the time of my 2nd vaccination almost 2 weeks ago.  I feel it for a few seconds to perhaps a minute or so, then it&#39;s gone for a while.  This repeats multiple times throughout the day.   I have had no other side effects from the vaccination, no temperature of flu-like symptoms.

                                                the day after vaccination, I had a recurrence of severe pain in my left knee (arthritis) and both shins and calves (myopathy).  In the past I have managed my arthritis and myopathy through stretching, exercise and weight management. I had no pain prior to the injection for many many months. I could not exercise for several weeks because of the pain. Given the severity of the pain and the fact I had not experienced it for several months prior to the injection, I strongly believe the reaction was caused by the vaccine (Pfizer).

This physician reported for himself that a 67-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine; Batch/lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for &#34;Because I am a physician, a healthcare provider&#34; (covid-19 immunization).  Medical history included had Covid back on the 4th of December.  There were no concomitant medications. Physician stated he was wondering he just took your Pfizer Covid vaccination, the first one. He took it couple of days ago. He took it on the 30th of this month, two days ago. Physician further stated he developed the fever for all about 30 hours after the vaccination. Just because he developed the fever with the first one, it was like a 101.7 that was about 36 hours. So the question was just because he developed the fever with the first one, he was pretty sick, he meant he felt palsy, you know headache and all that it was like probably developed the same with the second one? Patient weight was maybe 125 pounds. When probed if vaccine was prescribed by any Physician, Physician stated he went himself. Causality by physician stated as &#34;he think so&#34;. Lab work reported as He did not have the results yet. He just look a Covid screening test because he had Covid back on the 04Dec. So, he just took a Covid screening test. Treatment received included aspirin. The outcome of all events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the event palsy cannot be excluded as the information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3302 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol since 90s and was taking medication to keep it down, and ongoing neuropathy in the feet back in the 90s. Patient seemed to be okay after the vaccination until he didn&#39;t rest well last night on 13Jan2021. The morning of 14Jan2021, he had chills and was aching all over. He has a headache, and he was pretty tired on 14Jan2021. His temperature was 99.9. and wanted to make sure he was okay. They gave him the sheet of side effects but was wondering how long it was going to last. He also had fever and chills on Jan2021. He has been just resting all day long which was all he felt like doing. Patient felt he has a bad case of the flu. When his chills started, he noticed he was tremoring and shaking and his muscles are achy on Jan2021. He usually waits until his temperature is over 100 to take something and noticed where he got the shot was achy on Jan2021. During the night he went to aching more. He was not too excited about getting up and doing anything now. He was tired on 14Jan2021, because he didn&#39;t rest well last night and slept in late today. He finally got around, and ate cereal and stuff. He has just been sitting. He would still get the second vaccine, which was not exciting. Outcome of the events aching all over, headaches, and tired are not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

At various times after I would become aware I was home, alone, on couch, unable even sit up. On one occasion I determined it was 1437hrs, Tuesday, 08 Feb 2021, and sent two text messages with great difficulty just saying HELP. IT was actually 0237hrs, Monday, 08 Feb 2021. Both HELP messages had been replied with questions about what the problem was. At 1200hrs, Tuesday, 09 Feb 2021 I became lucid again though at first I believed it to be Wednesday, 10 Feb 2021.

Beginning Jan 2021 I started experiencing a little yellowish nasal discharge with slight nasal congestion and occasional pressure in the maxillary sinuses. On Jan 21 received the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Because of no improvement with symptomatic treatment of sinusitis, on Feb 3 started Augmentin 500 mg 3 times a day. On Feb 7, symptoms became much worse: fever 38.2C (100.7F), chills, muscle aches but the most troubling symptom was severe (level 8) face pain. Bouts of pain lasted for a few seconds but repeated about every 30 sec. It felt like an electric shock originated in the nasopharynx and extending to the maxillary sinuses. Pain affected both sides of the face but mostly the right side. Additional symptoms: scalp tenderness, neck pain and light stiffness while moving, skin hyperesthesia. On Feb 8, underwent PCR COVID-19 testing, which was negative.  On Feb 12, canceled the 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, rescheduled for Feb 19. Since Feb 14 no pain and fever.  Treatment:  1. Because I had a thought that I may be developed a nasopharyngeal Herpes zoster infection, on Feb 11 I started  Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times a day. 2. Ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times. 3. Augmentin (stopped after 4 days, on Feb 7).

(Temperatures were in the 80&#39;s)  a feeling of nerve irritation under  the skin that moved from place to place.  unsteadiness on my feet, lack of focus, a basic, total shut down. I curled up in fetal position under a pile of covers for 24 hours. Didn&#39;t fully recovery for 3 days  All simptoms hit me more or less simultaneously within 5 minutes, about 12 hours after 2nd covid shot.  Didn&#39;t seek medical attention, just plowed through it.  I imagined a biological warfare agent would have felt like that. &#34;I thought I was gunna DIE!&#34;

                                                My husband has had a fever and extreme exhaustion every day, all day. for 16 days, since he go the Pfizer vaccine. He is retaining water, does not sleep at night, has heavy night sweats, and is emotionally spent. He has no appetite and forces himself to eat. He tastes what little food he eats. He visited his family doctor, a gastroenterologist, and has been in the emergency room two times for sheer exhaustion and pain. He was released both times after tests. Each time, no one could find a cause and no one sent him to other doctors for help. They would not admit him because there was no guarantee he could see other doctors any faster than if he were at home making appointments. He was referred to an infectious disease specialist by the gastroenterologist, but that appointment  isn&#39;t until March 9, 2021. He will have faded even more by then.

                                                SUMMARY Two weeks after first vaccine: uncontrollable shaking throughout body, followed by chills, then entire body ache and fever.  The first 12 hours were the worst, but after 36 hours all symptoms were gone.   DETAIL The Feb 3, 2021 First vaccine - Phizer Feb 18, 2021      5:00 pm suddenly came down with shaking throughout my body and then chills.        6:00 pm shaking subsided       7:00 pm entire body aches from head to feet      Later in evening - fever throughout body Feb 19, 2021 feeling better, but still muscle and joint pain throughout body.  Some slight fever.  No appetite, but can smell chicken broth.  February 20, 2021 feeling better but tired      10:00 am COVID test at pharmacy.      Noon ate peanut butter and crackers      2:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      6:30 pm ate full Mexican dinner  February 21, 2021 feeling good with a good appetite.  NO SYMPTOMS.       9:30 am breakfast      1:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      1:30 pm lunch REFLECTION: During entire time, no difficulty breathing or coughing.  And the other symptoms came and went in 36 hours.  The symptoms I did have are the same as a bad reaction to the 2nd vaccine.  (my muscle aches are not a reaction to the vaccine).  Yet, my reaction was not immediate, rather it was 2 weeks and 1 day after my first vaccine.  Therefore, do I have COVID, or a bad reaction to my first vaccine? WAITING for COVID test results.  Second vaccination is scheduled for upcoming Friday, February 26.

Took him to medical center where, after CT scan and blood work, he was diagnosed with Bell?s palsy. Unfortunately the treatment for this is a steroid and antiviral medication. By Sunday night he was exhibiting signs of mania.

A 67-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EN6200 , on 17Feb2021 at single dose in arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number ELI283) on 27Jan2021 and had no adverse effect. The patient was wondering if he hold the current record for the number of days consecutive for a person to have adverse reaction to the second vaccine because it was over a week and he could not move out of his bed. That almost killed him. His vision was also blurred. His weight was dropping rather rapidly because he was not able to eat. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9266 (it looked like 9266 or 9244)) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included stroke, balance was always off because of stroke, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, depression, diabetic (has diabetes), liver, enlarged heart, and cholesterol. Concomitant medication(s) included warfarin for an unspecified indication; entecavir for liver; metoprolol for high blood pressure and congestive heart failure; losartan for stroke and enlarged heart; bupropion for depression; glipizide for diabetes; metformin for diabetes; diltiazem hydrochloride (DILT-XR) for blood pressure and reduces stroke; atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient had his second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 and wanted to know these side effects. He had a sore arm on Feb2021 that was fine and went away on 2021. The following Sunday on 21Feb2021, he had really low blood sugar (40). He never had it this low (blood sugar never got that low like 40). He had to call emergency and went into emergency. He also had to call reported the week afterwards on 2021, his blood sugar was still low. In the following week, his blood sugar still stayed relatively low, not as low as when he went into emergency but it was still low between 50 and 70 in 2021 (also reported that the blood sugar was low the following week, the whole week, his blood sugar was still low, lower than it normally was). After that week, he started getting out of nowhere he just turn around and head started spinning on Mar2021, he was dizzy on 04Mar2021 and he lost his balance (couldn&#39;t tell because his balance was always off because he had stroke so he couldn&#39;t tell if it&#39;s from prior stroke or the vaccine) like he kept falling down and every time he got up he kept falling down (fell down multiple times) on Mar2021 (also reported that then after the week that&#39;s when he started getting really dizzy and falling down)- that just kept happening. He also had a couple of incidents of vertigo but, he usually fall down and got up and it usually go away but this one he kept falling down. He made it to his bed and he was going to call, but he was just resting. After that (now), he had been having off and on headaches on Mar2021. He wanted to know if anyone else has reported this and how long would this last. He talked to 3 of his doctors and these side effects of the vaccination. After the question they said, they really couldn&#39;t tell, as it can be understood that it could be a mixture of his health conditions and all his medications that he takes, cause these things happened he was just trying to find out if there was any different test, what caused his blood sugar go down. They stopped his medication that had brought back up. The falling down and headaches, they were not sure, so he was calling. Other people had called them up, the doctors really couldn&#39;t tell. They didn&#39;t really know. He didn&#39;t blame them. It was hard to tell, everybody was different, so he was just trying calling to find out. He was still experiencing headache on and off and dizziness. The HCP took him off his diabetic medications. He hadn&#39;t taken anything for the headache. He did take a couple of pills for the dizziness when he fell down because might thought it was of vertigo, so they gave him this medication- already taken 2 of them which was meclizine 25mg and took it twice. He had a CAT SCAN (CSCAN) on 09Mar2021 and MRI on 14Mar2021, both with unknown results. The outcome of the event &#39;sore arm&#39; was recovered in 2021 as it already went away; &#39;low blood sugar (40)&#39;, &#39;dizzy&#39;, &#39;headache off and on&#39;, &#39;lost his balance&#39; was not recovered; of the rest of events was unknown.

There was no prescriber for the vaccine. He received the first dose on 14Mar2021 and on 19Mar2021, he started experiencing side effects. He said all 4 people in his household all got the vaccine and all had side effects. The moment the patient was helping his wife he felt like a sharp needle type pain going through the heart side of his chest. They were little ones, but it was uncomfortable. It caused him to panic. He hanged on to it and it went away in a bit. But 2 hours after that, he had chills and crawled in blankets and stayed until the rest of the night. He has not gotten up since 19Mar2021.  He has bone aches and leg and lower back pain aches. He has a headache on 19Mar2021 and started checking temperature on 25Mar2021.

Face is clear and only one place is left that is behind his neck on head.  No further details provided for lotion that he put on the rash. He provided information on Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg each.

The Lot is SSA011 and expiration is Oct2024. He has been taking Ibuprofen for many years and only taking one tablet instead of two. He needs to get up and get going and takes it to help him every day. He did not get tested for COVID, but his wife, son and daughter did and they all tested positive after receiving the vaccine. He assumes he has COVID as well since he has the same symptoms and lives in the same household. He would like to know if he can postpone next dose or can he quit.  Will this get better. If he could take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8730), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 10:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included knee surgery, dislocated shoulder (he has dislocated that shoulder in the past several times but had no recent issues), carpal tunnel syndrome and, rheumatoid arthritis, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. In Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm opposite where he received the injection. He reported he like had a muscle tear that it has an intense excruciating pain. He took three aspirin and put a heating pad on it that didn&#39;t touch it. He then reported that the pain went to his knee and it &#34;got all blow up&#34; and stated that that knee had to be drained. He then stated that the calf on his other leg &#34;got messed up&#34; and was found to have a blood clot as well as fluid on that knee. He reported that it was as stiff as a board and that he could not walk on either of his knees for a couple of days. He reported that he still has problems with the one knee that &#34;blew up&#34; and had to be drained but stated that the inflammation in the calf where blood clot was has receded and is back to normal. He stated that he had to visit the emergency room twice and see an orthopedic surgeon for these issues and has been prescribed Xarelto to take to treat the blood clot. In the morning his leg was stiff. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated on 16Apr2021, blood clot on right leg on 12Apr2021, and pain in groin on 13Apr2021. The pain in his groin went down, but his calf swelled to twice the size and it felt like a horse because he was favoring it. It felt like a muscle cramp. The orthopedic saw him for his left knee and he was seen in the Emergency Room for his right and they called his primary doctor. He tried to work and paid the price with his left knee. He has been taking Tylenol and icing it. The last two days (unspecified date) he has been babying it, the weather has been not so great, so he is laying low and give it a rest, but knows he is supposed to get up and move around so he has been doing that and elevating it. He would like to know if, based on these symptoms he experienced after the vaccine, he should get the second dose of the vaccine, which he states he is supposed to get on Tuesday. The outcome of the events &#34;Right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated&#34;, and &#34;Pain in groin&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

No tachycardia as he was checking his Apple Watch and no other symptoms.  ? 10:20 he drove home and called his wife can kept her on the call as he drove. He them experienced some mild tingling in his ears, face and lips.  ? 10:30 he got home and his lips were mildly swollen, more so on the upper lip, not as much on the lower lip.  ? 10:45 he took an Allegra and about 30-40 minutes afterwards the lip swelling started to calm  ? 5:45pm I spoke with him. He said he has no more symptoms. A little tired perhaps from the day or the Allegra (though it doesn?t cause too much drowsiness compared to Benadryl) ? He also reported he had a flu and shingles vaccine back in early November so it has been more than a month.

I took some Benedril which helped with swelling. that was the most severe after effect. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the vaccine because i had not been anywhere that weekend and had not  put my hands on anything unusual that i don&#39;t normally touch. It only happened to my hands. Other than that i had minor flu like symtoms from the shot,  achiness and slight fatigue feeling. I had an ER doctor look at my hands when i went in today to get help for my bronchitis, which i had some before the covid shot. It got worse on Monday. He perscribed prednisone which has pretty much taken the hand spots away..i was tested negative for covid today(1/19/21) by the way.

                                                Shot administered Wednesday morning. Sore arm, but not particularly bad. Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

Over the following six days, symptomes frogresses to extreme skin sensitivity and diffuse aching of chest cage and muscles, back, associated with fatigue and stiffness of joints especially after being at rest and trying to move. By the 6th day after onset of symptoms, an erythematous eruption developed along the left T7 dermatome, becoming more pronounced on the 7th day, but not the true vesicular rash we usually see in zoster dermatitis. Discomfort is relieved by taking excedrin and tylenol. I did not try NSAIDs due to gastritis reaction. No fever or chills, sore throat, cough, etc. I started Valtrex today  to be taken tid.

About 24-36 hours after the first injection noticed pain in the ball of my left foot.  Shortly after that swelling began in both feet.  Swelling became worse, doctors conclusion was metatarsalgia. Rest, ice, ibuprofen. Swelling got worse on Friday Jan 29, went to emergency at hospital. Diagnosis was nueroma, given a prescription for prednisone.  Began Prednisone Saturday Jan 30.  Swelling began to subside on Sunday evening. Has been improvement slightly throughout the week but still has not gone down.  Small pockets of dried blood are pooling the bottom of my feet where the swelling was the worst.

A 68-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 15:30 at single dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included back disorder and is waiting for back surgery, high blood pressure, and very likely diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon, didn&#39;t notice anything until Saturday. On Saturday afternoon (23Jan2021) he had a couple severe/serious episodes of shortness of breath. He has no other symptoms. It was better on Sunday and is better today but he still feels uncomfortable on Jan2021. He bought a oximeter today and while at rest he is at 94 but when he gets up to do anything it goes to 80. He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

A few minutes into cpr patient  started to profusely bleed - gi bleed and ventilation became very hard., intubation was very difficult and ventilation hard as we suctioned large amounts of aspirated blood. Patient was eventually intubated. More than 8 doses of epi ws given, sodium bicarbonate * 2 given with continuous  cpr. It was mostly PEA with one shockable rhythym. And shock delivered for vfib.   patient continued to profusely bleed, og insertion was not successful and effective ventilation was very tough due to massive aspiration,.

                                                Within an hour of receiving 2nd dose started experiencing headaches and dizziness. In addition to the headaches and severe dizziness I started having significant bouts with diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite and have not slept well.  Within a couple days I noticed pronounced tremors in my right hand and I started losing weight from 180 pounds to 157, around 23 pound loss.  I contacted my physician and was alerted to make this report and have an appointment on March 1.

                                                After about 3 hours (around noon) I began to feel like I was coming down with a cold and fever. By 4PM I had chills and body aches. By 8 pm I took my temperature and it was a low grade 99.8. Through the remainder of the night the chills worsened to the point where I was shaking uncontrollably and I could not get warm. I was also very dizzy. The next day (2/26/21) was more of the same along with a very painful headache and muscle aches especially in my shoulders and neck. That night all of those symptoms continued along with very sharp stabbing pains in my left leg above the knee cap. The dizziness also continued and I nearly passed out trying to get out of bed early in the morning. My fever had increased to 100.5 at the highest. I was also very weak by the end of the day on 2/26/21. On 2/27/21 I was beginning to feel a bit better but still had that low grade fever (now about 99.8) a headache and I remained very weak. The weakness was especially evident in my legs - it was very hard to stand up. It is now 2/28/21 and I am feeling nearly 100% myself again.   From all I had read and understood I was expecting to have a reaction to the 2nd vaccine. I did not consider any of this life threatening nor necessary to call my PCP. Still, I wanted to report these reactions as it is my understanding the adverse reactions to the 2nd vaccination are common in people much younger than me.

On 2/28/021 I developed pain, erythema, warmth and swelling at the 4th MCP in my L hand which persisted for several days.  I contacted my rheumatologist, and saw him on 03/04.  Since this was my first episode of inflammation in years, we elected to treat it conservatively with naproxen OTC.  My symptoms resolved after several days, but then I had successive episodes of pain, erythema, warmth and swelling in my R 5th MCP, R ankle, L 5th TMT, L 5th MCP, L knee and R wrist over the next 3 weeks--- in the pattern of palindromic rheumatism similar to that my symptoms had first began 18 years ago.  Given the number and severity of these episodes, doctor recommended treatment with prednisone 10mg PO qdaily for 30 days and restarting MTX 15mg (six 2.5mg tabs) PO qweekly  and folate 1mg PO qdaily.

I then was assisted to the bed, where my left arm and left leg felt numb. I rested assuming this would fade away, being I has some numbness from the 1st vaccine.  On 3/24/21, as I attempted to get up from the bed,   I could not maintain my  balance and gait. The numbness was still in my entire left arm and entire left leg, yet I was able to raise move and wiggle my limbs, toes, fingers to a degree.

Symptoms included delayed injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, 99.2 temp, injection site red (delayed and only on 7th day), nausea, feeling unwell, dizziness, weakness, and hives which were relieved with Benedryl.    Most of the symptoms began on Monday, February 8th and worsened on Tuesday, February 9th with hives.  There was no shortness of breath or respiratory issues.  Injection site was only tender on day of injection but tender and red on the 9th only.  Fatigue, headache,  hives continued on February 10th along with a slight bout of diarrhea.  Called clinic and they requested he go in and be tested for Covid-19 and results should be known in 2 days.  February 11th seemed to be better and as of 10:00 a.m. PST no hives but still itching and slight fatigue.  Again,  didn&#39;t know if it could be a reaction since it is a week out or something else.

I have take ibuprofen and acetaminophen to sleep.  Last night, I had night sweats.  I think tonight will be more of the same.  I have taken 3 Ducolax to see if a good bowel movement will set things straight.  Except for a couple of very small BM&#39;s , I have been constipated for the past 3 days.

A 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration, on the left arm, on 27Jan2021 at a single dose (at the age of 69-years-old) for COVID prevention. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had no other vaccines on the same day as his COVID vaccine. On 09Feb2021, the patient experienced peripheral neuropathy in his feet with a tingling and burning sensation and also reported a tingling and burning sensation around the end of his fingertips. The patient wanted to know if Pfizer has seen this as a side effect to the product and if he should get his second dose or not. The peripheral neuropathy has improved but it was also persisting and stated that it was persisting at a lesser level. The patient was recovering from the event.

                                                From Feb. 21 thru approx. Mar. 3 (day 8 - day 18 after vaccaination dose 1), I experienced pain / achiness  as itemized below; first part no unusual, second part unusual (two parts overlapped): Part 1: Feb. 21 thru Feb. 28 (day 8 - day 15): pain / achiness in lower back / kidney area; preceded by some pain in all joints; this time period marks start of needing to take Ibuprofen (either whole tablet or half tablet) to reduce pain, lasting thru Feb. 24. Part 2: Feb. 27 thru approx. Mar. 3 (day 14 - day 18): LOWER LEGS / SHINS / ANKLES PAIN AND SORENESS, needed to rub / massage to reduce pain; pain was at a signficant level and several day duration that surprised and even alarmed me; I considered calling my doctor, but assuming it was a temporary symptom caused by the vaccine, so I did not call, did not take more Ibuprofen, and gradually the pain reduced and petered out. I had not read of any such symptom.

                                                Before the second vaccine dose I had a lot of vitality, walking 10,000 or more steps a day and doing weights every other day. Now there are days when I don&#39;t have the energy to do my every evening walk and I tire out after a minimum of physical activity. I feel as though I have chronic physical fatigue with about 50% of my normal vigor. I tire out after vacuuming the floors in my house.  I didn&#39;t experience headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, coughing or other symptoms but the fatigue and feeling weary for three or more weeks after the vaccination concerns me.

However, approximately 2.5 weeks post 2nd vaccination I began to experience peripheral neuropathic symptoms  on the dorsal surfaces of bilateral hands (C6-7 dermatomes). It felt as if I were in a shower with a fine mist hitting both hands - even though the hands themselves were completely dry!. Only occurred while outdoors walking. No pain/numbness/weakness. Lasted roughly 10 days, starting to abate over last 48 hours! Coincidentally, had my first haircut (professional) in a year 3 days ago. I mentioned that it felt good to get out now that I was fully vaccinated. Without suggestion, the hair cutter mentioned that her 81-82 year old mother had had a 2nd vaccination and started feeling ?bugs crawling on the backs of her hands.? My eyes were like saucers because this was a totally-unsolicited remark which closely mimicked the symptoms I was experiencing. Fortunately, they seem to be resolving....!

Received second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine in AM of 3/16, having had severe adverse reactions (fever up to 104, n/v) to the first dose three weeks earlier. Experienced recurrent fevers (up to 103) beginning by the evening of 3/16, for which he took acetaminophen.   Awoke at 3 AM w/ recurrent fevers, for which he took ibuprofen. Felt better in AM, had breakfast, and retired back to bed. Awoke shortly after noon w/ severe n/v and AMS. Was brought to the ED by the EMS. Febrile (T 39.6) w/ rigors, tachycardic, tachypneic, and poorly responsive on arrival. Continued to experience episodes of emesis, and was felt to have possibly had a seizure episode (&#34;looked to the side and was shaking&#34;; no clear tonic-clonic movements noted). Was thus intubated for airway protection. Initial laboratory w/u revealed presence of mild leukocytosis (WBC 12.6, 47p49L0Eo), lactic acidosis (LA 5.2), hyperglycemia (glu 297), elevated lipase level (161) renal insufficiency (Cr 1.23). extubated on 3/19.  received antibiotics for positive blood culture (streptococcus parasanguinis).   diagnosis: ADVERSE EFFECT OF CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 VACCINE

A 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm at the age of 69 years, on 18Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known for a history of heart disease, stage 4 kidney failure and polycystic disease. He had been bleeding from the kidneys for a week prior to receiving the vaccine, heart attack and cholesterol. He stated he needs some reassurance and added he has Stage 4 kidney failure with polycystic disease. He already consulted with his heart doctor and kidney doctor and they say get the vaccine. He mentioned that every now and then he gets blood from a cyst rupture. On the day of the first shot he was having a little bit of bleeding in his urine. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for cardiac disorder; atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) taken for blood pressure abnormal and multivitamins. The first shot knocked him on his butt. He slept for two weeks then he started to pass blood clots in his urine. He read that the vaccine can cause clotting and he doesn&#39;t know if that might have caused the clots right after the shot. He just needs someone to hold his hand about getting the second shot. He has to leave in a couple of hours to get it. He was asking do we see a pattern where people have had a bad first reaction with the first shot and they don&#39;t have a bad a reaction the second time around. He clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 at 1600 in the right arm. He was fine until Saturday (20Feb2021) when he woke up nauseous; really tired; could not get out of bed; and then really didn&#39;t do anything for two weeks. He added he couldn&#39;t stay awake even sitting up in his chair. He couldn&#39;t eat anything because the sight or smell of food made him gag, even in the grocery store. He added he also noticed he started to get the blood clots in his urine the second day after the shot (20Feb2021). On 19Feb2021, he mentioned he had a bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and he usually does not bruise. He stated he felt like he had all the symptoms of COVID. All of these symptoms lasted two weeks. When he finally felt better the only thing he wanted to eat was a burger and fries. He is still bleeding but it is not clotting anymore. The clots only lasted about a week. He also thought he was having a heart attack, but was too tired to go to the hospital. After speaking to his physician/specialist, they encouraged him to go ahead and get the 2nd dose. The patient  would like to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks for him to receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine based on his medical history. The patient would like to know whether one dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine provides some protection. The patient was asking whether he might die from receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The outcome of the events heart attack was unknown; events bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and blood clot in urine was recovered on 27Feb2021 while other events were recovered on 06Mar2021.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number and expiration date were not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies: dust, pollen, grass, and trees. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He received first shot on 04Jan2021, 5 days ago. He has had no bad reactions. He was happy to report. He then stated it was done in his left arm, and it was a little sore. He also had a slight headache that first evening which was unusual for him. So far so good. He was due for his regular allergy shot which he generally gets every 2-3 weeks for dust, pollen, grass, and trees. He lived in (City) and has pretty good allergies. It is said on the allergy shot not to have a flu shot within 72 hours of getting the allergy shot, so he was just wondering if it will be safe for him to have the allergy shot within approximately 120 hours of receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine. &#34;Is it safe or advisable to have his allergy shot done today when it has only been 5 days since getting the COVID vaccine? Is he putting himself at any kind of risk?&#34; He did not have the name of the allergy shot to provide. He said it is just an injection of a little bit of the allergen. He is not a health provider. He was on the early receiving end of the vaccine because he was a hospital volunteer and works in PACU. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The paramedic and I looked up and  noticed a sudden change in mental status- dropped his phone and started making slight grunting noises as well as turning pale. We rescued the patient, got the stretcher and he became  lucid. His activity was seizure like  (petit mal). I  called the ED charge nurse, provided report, and the patient was transported via paramedic X 2 to the ED for an evaluation.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

By 10:30pm was shivering with temperature of 101 fahrenheit, headache, sinus congestion with clear liquid running out of nose and nausea. Took two acetaminophen at 11:00 pm. About two hours later, nose stopped running and just had nasal drip. Could not sleep. At 3:30 am  (Tuesday morning) nausea subsided. At 10:00 a,m Tuesday still in bed but felt better. Checked temperature and still 101. Continued to take acetaminophen every six hours as recommended. Checked temperature  in the afternnon and it was 99. Checked temperature again at 9:00 pm before going to bed  and it was exactly 98.6.  Decided not to take more acetaminophen. Got up around 3:00 am (Wednesday morning) to use restroom and  checked temperature. It was 100.2. Took two acetaminophen and went to bed. That was the last time I registered an elevated temperature. Still feel weak and tired six days later.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

                                                I had painful swelling of the testicles within the first 24 hours. They were hot, red, very much enlarged and extremely painful. I had a mild fever (99.4) which was about 2 degrees above normal. The selling has subsided in the second 24 hours and my temperature returned to normal. There is still moderate swelling and sensitivity. I had not seen this reported as a common side effect of the vaccination. I thought it should be reported.

Shot location was nominal and there was no swelling.  Woke up around 2:00 am and noticed that my left hand was numb as was my lower arm.. I am a side

It also felt like a nerve was being pinched causing a discomfort down to my ache and foot.  Felt like my foot was trying to go to sleep and tingling. This feeling woke me up about 1 am in the morning ( 2/26) and unable to get comfortable to go back to sleep.  Cause me to limp , unable to put full weight on the leg. This lasted all night and during the day has improved.  It feels somewhat weak, but I can put weight on the leg with a light limp. My foot feels like it has recovered from going to sleep and now has blood flowing, less tingling.

About 34 hours after my shot, I started feeling discomfort from my fracture.  By 36 hours I had great discomfort and pain with some swelling.  More pain than with the original fracture /fall.  Talked with vaccine hotline at around 36 hours after shot.   They advised I talk with Doctor.  I did call doctor.  He advised elevation, two ibuprofen and on Tylenol every 4 to 6 hours.  I did that.  Now 48 hours out from shot, extreme pain gone; Have swelling and discomfort.  Only took two rounds of ibuprofen and Tylenol.

Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

A 70-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 13Jan2021 11:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical histories. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been having side effects such as sharp lower back pain going down his right leg on late thursday (14Jan2021) afternoon, but probably the morning of 15Jan2021, which he never had before. It feels almost like a pinched nerve, but hasn&#39;t done anything to exert himself since he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. He did not cause this pain himself and wanted to know if anybody else has reported this. Outcome of the event was unknown.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber. The patient&#39;s second dose was on 19Feb2021. The outcome of the events stomach cramps, felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t was recovered on 30Jan2021, not a lot of energy/little lack of energy, not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine/whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine was recovering, while unknown for the rest of the events.

                                                A couple of days after 2nd vaccine in series, began to develop rash on left side/rib area extending around waist to spine.  Rash was initially maculopapular with erythematous base.  As rash continued to spread around waist, areas became vesicular grouped lesions.   Experienced severe pain, stinging, burning at lesion sites and around flank area to back.  Continuing neuropathic-type pain.   Treated symptoms with calamine lotion,   topical patch, and ibuprofen for discomfort.   Lesions have now crusted for the most part,  rash in various stages of healing with a few vesicular areas remaining.  Continues to have neuropathic pain to area.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

                                                My father developed a severe headache on the evening of 3/15,  followed by left sided facial paralysis, facial droop approximately 7 days after receiving the  first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at a CVS pharmacy.  He was admitted to hospital on 3/16 for acute stroke workup given his VERY CLEAR Facial droop, slurred speech. His CT  Head was negative for acute bleed and his MRI Brain was negative for any acute stroke. He was seen by Neurologist while inpatient and was determined to have Bell Palsy and NOT an acute or subacute stroke.   Prior to taking the vaccine, he had NO facial droop. After taking the vaccine, he received no new medications nor did he travel to any other places. Additionally, he lives in a city and has not been hiking in the woods.

The intensity was severe enough to prevent sleeping for over eight hours. This was accompanied by chills alternating with feeling hot without a measured fever. Six hours after the onset of pain two 500 mg acetaminophen were taken with some blunting of the pain though minimal improvement. After the initial eight hours the pain in in the joints and muscles subsided over about four hours. The headache that was akin to migraines in the past persisted for another six hours and was eventually relieved by two doses of ibuprofen 600 mg six hours apart.

Medical history included: diabetes, the patient was told his labs look really good, his diabetes was down around 100 when he pokes his finger, and his blood pressure was really good. He had no fever, only minor colds in the last year (2020). Last summer he had a minor surgery and colonoscopy and every thing was clear on that. The patient had not had COVID. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), atorvastatin, glipizide for diabetes, lisinopril, pioglitazone, tamsulosin, all from 2014. The patient previously took flu shot and shingles shot for immunization. The patient got his first vaccine shot. He hadn&#39;t really had any reaction. When he took the Band-Aid off this morning there was no blood spot on the Band-Aid and it didn&#39;t really hurt when he got the shot. He had a little soreness in his arm, he was left handed but did a lot of things with his right hand and has done that today. The caller confirmed the shot was given in his right arm. This was not anything like the flu shot or the other shot he got a couple weeks ago, he can&#39;t remember the name of that shot but it is the one that made a person break out. He noted that he and his wife went through that with that shot. Caller remembered it was the shingles, the second shot he couldn&#39;t remember, that he hated. He was not looking forward to that second dose. He got it at a local pharmacy, the flu shot was first and about a month later he got the shingles shot. In 2-4 months got to get the second dose and he is not looking forward to that. The patient&#39;s second bnt162b2 dose is due 10Feb2020 at 8 am. Outcome of the event was unknown.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3302), intramuscular on 22Jan2021 15:10 at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml by intramuscular injection left shoulder) for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (diagnosed about 21 years ago), ongoing gout (Diagnosed about 2 years ag), ongoing ankle spur right foot, ongoing diminished cartilage both knees, joint pain. The concomitant medications included torsemide. The patient reported adverse event (AE) after his first Pfizer-Biontech covid19 vaccine at 15:10  on 22Jan2021. He reported arm pain starting 3 hours after vaccination until noon the next day (23Jan2021). When he woke up on 23Jan2021 he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute. The pain inhibits walking, standing, etc. He did note that he is &gt;300lbs and has had joint pain in the past, but the hip pain is new. He also thought it might be kidney pain, as he takes a daily diuretic. He stated he has been treating with Aleve twice a day, but that walking is still very bad.  The patient is an optometrist that was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and said that he did not know if the Lot number written on the vaccination card is EL3302, E13302, or EI3302. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and reported that he got a sore arm about 3 hours after receiving the injection. He woke up with a sore lower back pain. He is 5ft 9.5 and 310 lbs and he is on Torsemide, a pretty strong diuretic. He woke up with the back pain and stated that it moved right and middle to his buttocks, a little lower than the end of his spine and to the right. He did not think it was his kidneys. He said that Torsemide can make kidneys work overtime. His knees were pretty shot, the left worse than the right. No further details provided. He was upset to know that he has shrunk a 1.5 inches over the years. He has been taking 2 Aleve a day since Saturday, this morning was his 4th pill. He said that it is really odd when he stands equally on both feet his lower back hurts. He has to sleep on his right side and that it hurts more when he sleeps on his back and on his left side. He was fearful doing eye exams next to his patient and how the lower back pain would affect him.  Reporter considered seriousness for Lower back pain was Medically significant. The outcome of event lower back pain was not recovered; of event arm pain was recovered on 23Jan2021; of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event low back pain cannot be excluded. The ongoing gout and concomitant drug torsemide may also play contributory roles to the event.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL2437), intramuscularly on 13Jan2021 11:00 on right arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type was at Clinic. Medical history included Myocardial infarction from 2019, Prostate cancer from 2016 which biochemical reoccurrence caused his PSA to bump up, Subclinical hypothyroidism, prevention of coronary artery disease, prevent platelet aggregation, urgency incontenece, asthma symptoms, High Blood Pressure from 2009 and ongoing, Aortic insufficiency from 2008 and ongoing. Ongoing concomitant medications included Carvedilol from 2011 for high blood pressure, rosuvastatin from 2015 for prevention of coronary artery disease, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) from 2019 for prevent platelet aggregation, tamsulosin from Dec2020 for urgency incontenece, levothyroxine from 2011 for Subclinical hypothyroidism, montelukast from 2011 for asthma symptoms. The caller stated that he was a physician and emeritus professor. He received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and developed Bell&#39;s Palsy on 24Jan2021 after receiving this first dose. He had already reported this reaction but he would like to know if there was any safety information on receiving the second dose after this type of adverse reaction. Patient had &#34;mentioned&#34; the reaction to his HCP but he had not spoken with her about specific guidance on whether or not to receive the second dose. Patient wished there was a way he could see more information regarding patients who have reported Bell&#39;s Palsy as a reaction to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to see if it could be a trend related to mRNA in the vaccines or if it was statistically insignificant. Patient visited the Emergency Room on 25Jan2021. Patient had a Contrast head CT scan on 25Jan2021. The results were read by the radiologist. The neuro radiologist also read the results and made a revision. He had two different reports, it showed a lacunar infarct in the M1 region from MCA. Not causing facial paralysis. There was no defined cause of the paralysis. Patient was asking if we have a resource on the significance of Bell&#39;s Palsy following a vaccine. He was scheduled to have the booster on 04Feb2021 and needed to know what to do. Treatment was received for the events included Prednisone and Acyclovir. The outcome of the events were not resolved.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported Bell&#39;s Palsy and lacunar infarct, and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Over the next two days that pain migrated to my right buttock and radiated down my right leg.  With full weight applied to my right leg the leg had weakness and would occasionally buckle.  I am due for my second injection but am considering not taking the second injection fearing permanent nerve involvement.  As of today 2/23 the pain in my right leg and buttocks is lessened but still present.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male patient with a complex medical history with multiple problems and cancers and debilities.  He received a second dose of COVID vaccine yesterday about midday.  Shortly thereafter, he started having shivers and shakes.  The concern that I had when he called the office was a possible bacteremia.  He was sensitive emergency room for evaluation.  He was noting that he was chilled and was unable to get warm. He said his temperature was up to 100.5.  He had generalized weakness and inability to get up and walk and had malaise.  He has no known exposures to pneumonia or other illnesses.  He has basically been homebound for the past year with the COVID.  He was evaluated in the emergency room and found to have an elevated white blood cell count on the right upper lobe pneumonia on portable chest x-ray.  Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained since he had a urine abnormality as well.  The patient was admitted to observation while we wait on cultures and we treat the pneumonia with antibiotics.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spasm in the back of neck which included Tylenol Arthritis pain. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 29Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was administered at a military base. Medical history included hypertension (controlled with medication) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no known allergies. There was no other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medication included lisinopril, felodipine and tamsulosin (reported as medications in two weeks).  On 04Feb2021 at 17:00, the patient experienced chills, fatigue, neuropathy on feet, arms, and chest and lack of sleep for the last 12 days. The patient was advised to drink plenty of water and take Tylenol. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The events required a doctor office and emergency room visits. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included influenzas A: negative, influenzas B: negative, both on unspecified dates; and COVID-19 nasal swab: negative on 08Feb2021, 11Feb2021 and 12Feb2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

                                                Pt woke up at 7. Cleaned up brushed his teeth and came upstairs from the basement to the kitchen. Poured a cup of coffee and sat down on living room chair four feet from me. He slumped over. I went to him and tried to wake him but he had passed out. Could not tell if he was breathing. I called 911. Put phone on speaker. I was told to lay him in the floor and start chest compressions.  I did this for about 4 minutes when he made some noise.  The first sheriff arrived after 8 minutes and by then PT had started to come around. He rolled over on his side and spoke to the sheriff. A couple minutes after that the ambulance arrived and the EMTs took over. They got him up and in the chair. Checked his pulse, blood sugar, blood pressure and did two EKGs. Everything was normal. He of course did not remember what happened but was very coherent. His conversation was very normal. They stayed with him about 30 minutes and he chose not to go to the hospital. He was out about 10 minutes. He has since been to the doctor and checked out fine.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration (to left shoulder) on 19Jan2021 (given later in afternoon) (at the age of 71years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included arthritis (has some arthritis in his knee and also in left elbow (diagnosed in left elbow around Nov2020)), injury (had an injury a year or so ago). Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN (E.C.)) taken because of injury. The patient previously took epinephrine and experienced he couldn&#39;t take it, procaine hydrochloride (NOVOCAINE), epinephrine and experienced epinephrine in it, his heart races for 3 days, it felt like he was running a marathon and smallpox vaccine for immunity to small pox (when he was probably in grade school). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient had his first dose on 19Jan2021, it went well, his arm was a little sore (in 2021), but he didn&#39;t have any reaction to that. The vaccine facility was in a hospital clinic and not in a military facility. The event did not require an ER visit nor of physician&#39;s office There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event was unknown.

The patient clinical course was reported as follows: About 12 hours later almost to the hour, he had symptoms including: fever, real bad headache, chills, and the fever ran somewhere 100 or a little over he guesses. This lasted most of that morning on Wednesday on the 24Feb2021. He took his temperature with an oral digital thermometer. He reports his temperature usually ranges 97.7-97.6 somewhere around there. And he couldn&#39;t get warm. He had a mattress heater turned up and he felt weak and since he&#39;s by himself he has to get up to get water and he put his heavy robe on then he got back in bed. He never went to sleep, he couldn&#39;t fall asleep, his arm really hurt where he got the shot. There was a little ache with the first one but this one here really, really was bothering him. When he first got the second shot, he hates needles, it was a little sore and then when this started it really started to hurt and it was warm. That went on to the morning, then it started letting up a bit. His daughter came by and made him chicken soup and he felt a little better, still weakfish. His fever went down kind of far and he laid down the rest of the day. Towards dinner time or so he felt warm but didn&#39;t have fever, he went the opposite from being chilled to being warm but his temperature was around 98. Then later on he was taking some pain medicine, called his doctor and asked what he should take for the headache. Take whatever he has there is what he was told. Acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It says Headache relief, caller states he is just about blind, acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It got rid of whatever he had. Patient stated he needs to change the thingy on his CCTV.

He reports whatever fever he had, he was soaked but he felt really ok then from then on. He finally got up around 7-730 AM and he&#39;s feeling ok now. If he had a fever it broke. He reported it seems to be improved on the 25Feb2021. He was feeling pretty good he started making coffee so he didn&#39;t feel bad and he hasn&#39;t had anything since. He reports his arm is not bothering him unless he pokes it. It&#39;s the same thing with the flu shot, if he pushes on it in a certain place he knows he got the shot.

Rushed him to Urgent Care, they sent him home and the next day I took him to ER. He was admitted. MRIs, CT scan, Blood Cultures, 2 Covid tests.  Nothing definitive as to why he was so ill other then a viral infection.   We are not assuming or indicating it is vaccine related but we think it&#39;s worth noting.  Nothing in his routine had changed other then receiving the 1st vaccine.   No one at the hospital indicated it was related.

On 24Jan2021, the patient reported that his middle fingertip became numb two days after the injection. Progressed from minor numbness to black spots on fingernail edge and grew into black dead finger tips on three fingers of left hand. Then spread to two middle fingers on left hand. Hand specialist, vascular surgeon and rumatologist are shocked at the damage being caused. Now on blood thinners which seems to have reduced spread. Pain in intense and at times unbearable. The ends of my fingers were gangrenous and now the skin and dead material was sluffing off. Micro clotting was the cause as per 4 of the doctors treating him. The patient received blood thinners, Eliquis as treatment for the events. The events were assessed as serious with life-threatening and disabling/incapacitating as seriousness criteria. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequel. The patient did not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver transplant, Patient&#39;s liver transplant was 6 years ago. A-Fib from an unknown date. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital in (Name). Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer of the vaccine was on 24Mar2021, Wednesday, at 4pm. On Thursday, usual fatigue, that people get, Friday morning, diarrhea 1 bout, and dizziness, gave him water, HR erratic 80, 90 to 70 into 100, which as like AFib, BP went to 64/55, put in in w/c had him lay down, hand cold, weak, drain. He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue. Early Friday morning, he woke up patient had one bout of diarrhea. Then patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter has memories of that, and reporter does not want that to happen again. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue: Patient did not go to church on Sunday. Patient started feeling better on Saturday, 27Mar2021. Early Friday morning, patient had one bout of diarrhea: Reporter clarifies that patient experienced diarrhea and got dizziness. Reporter knew then that she had to get patient to drink water. Reporter thought that patient might be dehydrated. Patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100: A-Fib started the morning of 26Mar2021. It was resolved completely by the same evening, about supper time. After the A-Fib started, patients heart got more stable after about 20 minutes. Reporter then hung up with the nurse from patients primary care physicians office. Patients heart rate continued to be erratic until supper time, but it was not bad. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient had low blood pressure: Reporter checks patients blood pressure in the mornings. Patients blood pressure is now back to normal. Patients low blood pressure has resolved. It continued a bit on Saturday, 27Mar2021. It resolved on Saturday evening. Reporter is still having patient push fluids. Patient is still currently drinking a lot of fluids with electrolytes.

On 06Apr2021 at 17:00, 5 hours after the vaccination, the patient experienced fever (103.2 degrees), lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair, needed help getting him in and out of bed, conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space, chills, and was so cold that his fingertips were blue. On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. The reporter further explained that the patient experienced chills, fever, lost the lability to walk and needed a wheelchair, and needed help getting help in and out of bed. She stated he was unresponsive but clarified that he was conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space. The chills lasted for less than an hour. She put a heating blanket on him. She added that he was so cold that his fingertips were blue. The chills ended and he ran into a fever which lasted for 10 hours. She mentioned that if his fever would have been greater than 105 degrees, she would have sent him to the emergency room. The highest it reached was 103.2 degrees. She gave him Tylenol and cold compresses which brought his temperature down to 101. He was comfortable. Initially, on an unspecified date, his breathing, color and blood pressure were all good. While he had a fever, she observed that to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. From a cardiovascular view he is healthy. The local paramedics come and check on him periodically and the reporter monitors his glucose and blood pressure (unknown results). She stated that all of these were complicated by him having dementia. The reporter stated that he was getting better. She was not panicked and was not complaining. She wanted the officials to know that she thinks people who have had Covid should be tested to see the level of antibodies present or a titer test before having the vaccine and that maybe they not need the vaccine. The events did not require visits to emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The reporter assessed the events &#34;Fever (103.2 degrees)&#34;, &#34;lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair&#34;, &#34;needed help getting him in and out of bed&#34;, &#34;conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space&#34;, &#34;fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths&#34; as serious (medically significant). The patient recovered from chills on 06Apr2021 (after less than an hour), &#34;Fever (103.2 degrees)&#34; on 07Apr2021 03:00, &#34;fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths&#34; on 07Apr2021, &#34;conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space&#34; on 12Apr2021; recovered with sequel from &#34;lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair&#34;, &#34;needed help getting him in and out of bed&#34; on 09Apr2021; and was recovering from &#34;was so cold that his fingertips were blue&#34;.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based from know drug safety profile and sequence of events,  the reported events in relation to suspected drug BNT162B2 cannot be totally excluded.

A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EN6203; Expiration Date: Jun2021) dose 2 via an unspecified route of admin-istration on 07Mar2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included diabetes mellitus; he does not take medication for it. It was controlled by diet and exercise, high blood pressure, high lipids, herpes zoster from Oct2019, bell&#39;s palsy from Oct2019, herpes zoster oticus from Oct2019, paralysis, vertigo, ear disorder, paraesthesia oral and his tongue was tingly. Concomitant medications included alprazolam taken for sleep disorder, simvastatin taken for lipids increased, alprazolam (XANAX) taken for sleep disorder.  The patient had his second shot last sunday and had a discussion had with his doctor&#39;s nurse this morning that centered around people taking the Moderna and had some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or some-thing like that and he wanted to call about what had happened. He has had overlapping stuff from cer-vical stenosis that manifests on the left side on his shoulder arm and hands and also about a year and half ago Oct2019 he had shingles in his ear and mouth on the left side of face. He had Bell&#39;s palsy and Ramsey Hunt syndrome number 2. He had paralysis, droopy mouth, eye wouldn&#39;t close, vertigo, ear issues, hearing drop and that recovered which was weird. He went to physical therapy until early last year before COVID then he was steered away from that. About 10 months ago some of the symptoms came back in a odd way. His eye had the feeling like it couldn&#39;t close. His eyelids had at night the muscles in his face on the left side face felt taut. The inside of his gum felt like his skin was thicker, he was not sure it was the sensation and that never went away. With the shingles he had an issue where down the side of his tongue was tingly, these things overlap and it was either very little or really an-noying. In last 10 months it had got quite a bit better until about 5-6 weeks ago it was back to where it was, it was just annoying on and off. Then he got the shot sunday, and it was weird at first, he was writing it off as both stress and relief and other things. He was not dizzy and that evening the left side of his mouth went bonkers, it wound up being like when the shingles were acting up on the inside of his mouth it felt tingly and weird, and it was confined to the left half of his face and nothing else. He did not have droopiness or any Bell&#39;s palsy kind of thing had gone away the Ramsey-Hunt syndrome, he says it was a series of things and he has number 2, he does not know what the other ones are, but it was something that comes along with the chicken pox or the herpes zoster virus. The stenosis, the cervical stenosis, the left is the main problem, but the right was not far behind with regard to nerve compression, the right does not bother him as much in the way of tingling and numbness. The weird thing is he had his hands sitting in his lap and he moved his thumb towards his forefinger, there was a couple inches between and it felt like there was a rubber band pulling his thumb back, it happened 2-3 times he was fooling around with it and it went away, the sensation was still there a little in the back ground, the rest of him the right side of him was fine and today is a lot better like he said things over lap so he is not saying anything has anything to do with the vaccine but he is operating under the as-sumption that if Moderna patients are having some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or something similar, if he has left over inflammation and in Nov2019, he had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), when he first got sick and then he had another one done and his neurologist said on an unspecified date in Aug that he still sees some nerve inflammation particularly down jaw line, he saw inflammation from 2019 to 2020 he still seen inflammation and the upper part of his eye, the brow seems to behave as if there may be some inflammation running through it. His hand on the right is not doing the thing is his left thumb, it is being weird and the thing sunday night with his mouth. He thinks the whole idea is that the vaccine wakes up the immune system and gets it to recognize the RNA for COVID and generate anti-bodies and if it is acting like inflammation gets the body&#39;s attention, he is not a biologist but maybe it also caught on to his nerve inflammation and took a look at his nerves and cause them to bounce around and have other things occur that were more intense and he was trying to report to let some-one know that the underlying things left over from his shingles, he does not know about the rest of it because sleeping wrong could affect his neck shoulders and arms, he was not sure if it could be an is-sue with the vaccine, there was no clear definite thing, but the thing sunday night with his mouth was definitely far more, he thought this was the way he felt in his mouth a couple weeks after he got the shingles diagnosis like he had hives on inside of his cheek and tongue, it was crazy with extra salivation but he did not have the hives. The last time he got a vaccine it was the Shingrix it was probably too late last year, he got pretty sick off of it with flu like symptoms but he doesn&#39;t ever want another run in with shingles. It was his second COVID 19 vaccine he got 07Mar and it was the same day that the thing with his mouth happened and that was the most noticeable aspect of it, if he had not had the vaccine he would be sitting here right now just thinking he was having a bad day it runs down the left side of his tongue and stops smack in middle of the front of it. It jumps over sometimes but he was not sure if the nerve endings go on both sides of the tip of tongue or not. It has improved since sunday there was a span there where it was pretty annoying and he commented that he feels like it did when he first had shingles and over a period of time when he went to bed, whenever that was, it abated a bit. His second dose was EN6203 and it is dated Jun2021. The patient was sure they were trained to draw up the exact correct amount in there but he did not ask to look at it, it did not even occur to him. The only other thing is he was diabetic, he takes no medications for that it was diet and exercise controlled both of which COVID has been horrible for, his weight has gone up because they have a tough climate there, it has been cold for 2.5 months. It was finally starting to get a little better but the primary things he would have would be blood pressure, he takes medication for and the same for lipids he takes Simvastatin for that, the things many males his age are taking medication for. He also takes Alprazolam and Xanax to get to sleep at night, because his brain doesn&#39;t want to shut off, cost of being an engi-neer. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, the thing never changed since, it never showed up anywhere else. he does not know if that disappears but he never ended up getting it again. Apparently it shows up frequently in lungs but it did not with him. Those 2 things would be the top of the list type of things for him. He has never had cancer or blood disease, he had mononucleosis in college. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerized tomogram there was nothing left on. He had one case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, magnetic res-onance imaging was an unknown results on Nov2019. He first got sick and then he had another one done , x-ray: there was nothing left on an unknown date. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncov-ered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

I took 400 mg of ibuprofen and symptoms subsided substantially in 30 minutes.  Much milder symptoms persisted for 24 more hours and then almost completely resolved.

I had similar sx with the firat dose of the two but the second dose was definitley more symptomatic.  My chillswere so bad that I could bvarely open the Tylenol container to get the medicine out.  I should also state that I also had the Covid disease and I know that this is a risk factor for having a reaction.  I think people should be told that they could have a reaction so they do not plan anything important the following day, but they should still get the vaccine. The day following the reaction I felt perfect.

I was given three medications :  1. valACYclovir 1,000 MG TAB. TAKE ONE TABLETBY MOUTH EVERY 8 HOURS (FOR SEVEN DAYS). 2. predniSONE (DELTASONE EQ) 50 MG TAB.  TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY DAY FOR SEVEN DAYS. 3. ERYTHROMYCIN (ILOTYCIN) 5 MG/GM OPTH OINT.  APPLY TO RIGHT EYE AT BEDTIME.

                                                Vaccination on Friday. Aches and stiff joints started early on  Sunday. I hardly slept that night alternating from being too hot to too cold. Monday evening around 6pm: Chills started, sinus congestion, runny nose, general weakness,  shortness of breath. I took a hot shower and later used a rescue inhaler and was able to get my breathing back to normal. I  dressed in warm clothes and went to bed fully dressed around 10pm. 8am Tuesday I got up after a sound sleep and the symptoms were mostly gone except for a little sinus pressure and some joint soreness.

Then felt very weak. At night I could not sleep due to amplified tremor. At night I also had chills in lower half of body &amp; got very hot in my head. Also a very occasional, intermittent, very weak dry cough. During the day on 2/2/2021 my temperature was 99.8.  I was also very weak and tired and could eat very little until dinnertime, when I could not finish my dinner. Slept a little the night of 2/2/2021 but often woke up and had a hard time fall asleep due to tremors.

                                                I had about 24 hours of symptoms, starting on the evening of the vax:  Bad headache, overall fatigue, body aches, weakness in legs and knees, tenderness on the shoulder at the point of injection.  The headache responded to an extra tablet of acetaminophen, beyond my normal 1-a-day dosage.   The symptoms are now totally gone after 48 hours.  No need for further consultation or a physician call or visit, in my judgement.

This consumer reported for a 72-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 08:00 at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 prevention. The medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the shot on 19Jan2021. Since Jan2021, his arm was still sore, but he had been nauseated since then. He has no energy. He has had it almost four days. He was fine until he got it and his arm is sore and he is nauseated. He is usually on the go. The patient also has an inflamed liver. He has been sick since. The patient has no appetite, he is sweating, his bones are hurting, and he is tired. The consumer took her husband to his doctor, and they tested him for COVID, and it came back negative, but the consumer does not think the PA did the test right. The consumer doesn&#39;t know what to do with him, because he is still tired, and has no appetite. The patient is breaking out in cold chills, and his bones are still sore. When the patient got the vaccine, he was walking and talking, and by 11 AM that day, he was in bed. The patient had some labs done, and was being told that his liver is big, so the consumer did not know if the vaccine went to his liver. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Each attack lasted 15 to 25 minutes, and seemed to be alleviated by taking anti-acid (simethicone) pills. Quite likely related the vaccine: 11 days after the vaccine was administered, I experienced a rather severe headache, plus slight general weakness, and a raised temperature of between 98.9 and 100.4 degrees. The first 10 days I had discerned no adverse effects. This has lasted16 hours so far, with little alleviation.

The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 24Jan2021 the patient experienced headache, left arm and back pain, everything hurt. The patient said that &#34;it&#34; didn&#39;t bother him at all that day (23Jan2021) but on 24Jan2021 he had headaches, left arm and back pain and everything hurt. It was worse &#34;yesterday&#34; but &#34;today&#34; (on an unknown date) his arm and back still hurt. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physicians office. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included a new dental crown put on on 25Jan2021. The clinical outcome of headache was recovering.

                                                The day after the vaccine, I just had a mild headache and mild leg aches, off and on, and took Advil twice with complete relief. Then I was fine until 7th day when I awoke a 7am. I felt mentally &#34;weird&#34; and couldn&#39;t concentrate. Not dizzy. I ate my normal breakfast of lox, cream cheese and bread with coffee with cream and Stevia. I sat at the computer and could not concentrate or even read well, and felt confused at times. Then I got hot and sweaty, my mouth got very dry, I had pains and needles over my entire body, and the tip of my tongue got numb. I laid down in my bed and felt worse. My blood pressure was 160-170/105-110, and normally it is 120-135-70-84.  I thought maybe I was having a neurological event, so I had my wife take me to the ER. I was there about 6 hours, but after about 3-4 hours, let better. The symptoms would come and go, lasting 3-5 minutes, and slowly improved. After the 2nd treponin was negative, they let me go home. I felt tired and mentally off a little. I rested. The next am, I was back to normal and have stayed OK since.

Then later in evening both arms especially forearms top side. No real rash near injection site itself.  The rash was either or both burning or itchy, with some scaly areas outlined in white which looked much like very very dry skin.  The were no apparent rash areas on stomach, chest or back.  Took a 180mg antihistamine (fexofenadine) prior to bed to quell the itch. Applied Vaseline Intensive Care Hydration lotion to areas.   Morning saw some relief in rash redness, but by 10:30 am  Sunday itch has returned.

                                                This was the second Covid vaccine from Pfizer.  First vaccine was given 1/28/21 . EL3244.   No adverse side effects other than slightly sore arm at site of injection.  Second vaccine was given on  2/18/21 within a couple day I noticed tremors in my hands.  When to the doctor on Feb 25, 2021 , I talked to her about tremors.  No treatment at that time.  March 4, 2021 had a video doctor appointment and talked about tremors. She prescribed Propranolol 40mg.  No previous history of tremors.  Tremors are a little better with medicine after a couple days but not gone.  I can&#39;t use fork, button my sleeves or work tools at my job.  I did notice tremors in my back when climbing on a ladder at work.  These tremors started within  2 days of second vaccine.

In the last two weeks, I&#39;ve had intermittent cramping (arms, legs, back) after eating.    Something aggravated my IBS-C and I believe that could be the vaccination.   The cramping is still happening but not continuously.  In the last week, I&#39;ve had tingling or burning twinges on the outside of my right thigh, too, on and off.   Might have been connected with heavy keys in my right front pants pocket and a cell phone on my belt near the thigh.   The same meals that cause cramping seem to cause the tingling, but I don&#39;t know if there is a connection.  The tingling may be from Meralgia paresthetica.

I went to the Primary doctor, and he prescribed several pain killers to combat the pain, didn&#39;t help much , then went to the ER because I thought something happened. Had an MRI , which diagnosed I have pinched nerve in my spinal column in three places. Several doctors don&#39;t think this is related to the Covid shot, but maybe  a coincidence. As of today I am still taking nerve pain killers.

As it intensified it spread throughout my body: down my left arm into my wrist, to my back and hip area (i have had issues here for 20 years), into my knees and ankles and into my left calf muscle. Further, it gave me a bad headache. i was so uncomfortable I got very little sleep that night. It continues into the following day and didn&#39;t begin to subside until about 4:00 pm. The pain in my left shoulder and arm continued off and on until today, 03/19/2021, and was at it&#39;s worst when laying down and first thing in the morning upon waking up.

                                                terrible terrible stomach pain; bug in his colon; white blood cell 18000/19500; his blood pressure was out of the roof; could not eat anymore; he&#39;s lost 10 pounds; dehydrated; vomiting 5 times; nausea; feeling warm; broke out in sweats; arm was sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

                                                Patient reported he did not have any significant reactions to the first dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine given on 3/3/21. I have counseled patient on possible side effects and patient said he has no question. He looked fine after receiving the vaccine. However, after about 5 minutes, the wife who also received the second dose at the same time said he&#39;s not feeling well. I immediately went to check on patient and asked how he is feeling. Patient said he is feeling dizzy but has no problem in breathing. Wife and I were supporting patient in case he fell. I directed technician to call 911 and call for support from the front. Patient looked pale and hands were shaking. I kept talking to patient to keep his attention because he looked like he was about to faint. I had wife removed his mask in case if he had trouble breathing. Patient said he felt better after sitting for awhile. I checked his BP which was 68/48 and HR was 49. Patient said his normal BP was over 130. EMT arrived and checked his vitals and took him to ER due to low BP and HR. I called to follow up with patient after 6 hours. I spoke with wife who indicated that ER monitored patient and discharged him. Since he got home, he threw up 2-3 times but he was ok when I called and was resting. I counseled wife to ensure he stayed hydrated and if he gets worse, then she needs to take him to the hospital again. Within an hour, wife came to the pharmacy and said she&#39;s taking her husband to the hospital again. Wife has no reaction to second dose. She said she took aspirin just in case but she is fine.

Tee revealed no cardiac source of embolism. He is left with some expressive and receptive aphasia. He also has some loss of L eye vision. There was no stenosis of the carotid arteries but the left M2 branch was occluded. He did not have any atrial fibrillation in the hospital but is wearing a 30 day monitor currently.   We have no idea this was related to the vaccine but wanted to report. The Neurologist thinks it is just a coincidence.  But we still want you to know it happened.

Patient could not raise his arms above shoulder height, his knees and other joints did not want to bend, and he was in constant pain. Patient had had to receive five (5) steroid shots in an attempt to counteract this, and the doctor had stated he could receive no more. Patient contacted his doctor&#39;s office and local health department, but neither could help me. Patient was healthy and had no such issues before the shot, and now he was in the worst condition of my life. All these events with start date 09Mar2021, resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, and received treatment Steroid Shots. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Then a couple of days later I realized that I had low grain headaches (which never have), sneezing, running nose, and feeling flushed.  What clued me in to paying more attention to these symptoms:  I found myself two days in a row opening windows (in winter) because I was feeling hot/flushed and since I almost never have a fever, it took me a day to figure out that the hot/flushed feeling, plus other symptoms was probably a low grade reaction to the vaccination.  A week later, I remain stuffed up but the headache is going away and I have not felt flushed yesterday or today.

By morning it was fading away and within 24 hours rash was gone with slight lump that gradually faded away over the next 24 hours. There may have been a slight red flushing lower inner surface of the same arm that still seems to be there, but no elevated temperature, tenderness or significant redness compared to the original localized rash. The injection site never reddened but had a slight tenderness for 24-48 hours.

                                                30 hours after immunization, my lower left leg began to hurt. Within four hours I could barely walk. There was no swelling or redness present. It was a muscle pain in my calf and behind my knee. I took Tylenol and went to bed. The following day the pain was less intense, and I wore a compressive knee brace. On the second morning the pain had subsided and I could walk with a limp. The following day, all symptoms had disappeared. I did not seek medical advice.

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included heart rate irregular and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications were none. The patient said he had an irregular heartbeat after getting his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021. He said he had to go to the Emergency Room on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He clarified he checked his blood pressure at home and his blood pressure was low at 91/73. He said he also had a high pulse rate of 160, or better, for 9-1/2 hours. He said the only thing he can attribute his low blood pressure and high pulse rate to is the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he hasn&#39;t heard anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine being related to having an effect on the heart, but he personally believes it was his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose that caused his low blood pressure and high pulse rate. He clarified after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021, he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, fatigue, tiredness, and nausea. He said on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he recognized a small amount of chills, feeling feverish without having a fever, and sweating. He said his wife checked his temperature a few times on Saturday, 30Jan2021, and he never had a fever, but he felt clammy. He said he had noticed the nausea more than anything else. He said he maybe should have checked his blood pressure on Saturday, 30Jan2021. He said he didn&#39;t check his blood pressure until Sunday morning, 31Jan2021, and when he saw his low blood pressure and high pulse rate, he called the hospital and eventually drove to the Emergency Room. He said by the time he had got to the Emergency Room his blood pressure had went up to &#34;100 and something&#34;, but his pulse rate never changed, and his pulse was still 160. He said the doctor gave him several medications to try to get his pulse rate to come down. He said the doctor had given him a medication that was supposed to bring his pulse down. He said then the doctor had to add something else in a syringe to go with the other medication to bring his pulse down. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the medication&#39;s name. He clarified he never noticed his pulse rate was high until he took his blood pressure on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he felt the nausea start later Friday evening (29Jan2021). He said he already has stomach trouble anyways that he takes medicine for, so he took a pill, but the nausea continued. He clarified he took 1 Omeprazole 20mg capsule that was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, but stated the Omeprazole 20mg prescription looked like it expired in 2017. He said he knows he has a newer Omeprazole prescription, but did not know where the prescription bottle was. He reported on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he just laid around. He said he did not feel as bad on Saturday, as he did on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he called the Emergency Room on Sunday morning, and went to the Emergency Room. He said he didn&#39;t feel his 160 pulse rate. He said he was told by the doctor in the Emergency Room that his fast heart rate had his heart beating like he was having a stress test. He reported he doesn&#39;t know if he wants to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after what he experienced this past weekend. He reported he only takes blood pressure medicine that he has  been on for a while. He reported he had several EKGs done on Sunday, 31Jan2021, while he was in the Emergency Room. He said the EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 160s. He reported while he was in the Emergency Room he was given IV Heparin, IV Potassium, Potassium pills, and Amiodarone in a pill and IV form. He said the doctor added another IV medicine in a syringe, but he doesn&#39;t know the name of the medicine. He said the doctor also gave him IV Morphine because he had pain in his chest. He said the doctor said his chest pain was being caused by his heart trying to go back into a regular rhythm.  He reported he was in the Emergency Room for 11-12 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. He said his pulse rate wasn&#39;t coming down and stayed at 160 for 9-1/2 hours. He said the doctor wanted to admit him to the hospital, so he could have a procedure to make sure the high pulse rate didn&#39;t damage his heart. He said on Monday, 01Feb2021, he had a procedure where they went through his wrist and put a dye in his heart to see if the stress from his high pulse rate damaged his heart. He said his heart wasn&#39;t damaged, so he was discharged from the hospital later in the day on 01Feb2021. He clarified his blood pressure was good by the time the first or second EKG was performed in the Emergency Room. He clarified he already had an issue with sweating before he received his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he is still sweating, but he doesn&#39;t know if that is because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical outcome of high pulse rate and blood pressure low was recovered on 31Jan2021; nausea, fatigue/tiredness recovered on 02Feb2021; chills, feeling feverish recovered on an unspecified date; sweating was not recovered; while for the other events was unknown.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

                                                He noticed a sore arm on the following day.  He then noticed irritability for several weeks, but does not have it now.  He had a lack of concentration for more than a week that lasted 2-3 weeks.  Diarrhea 9 days after the vaccine that lasted for about a week.  General tiredness for about 2 weeks.  2 weeks and 2 days after vaccine had high BP, and it&#39;s better today at his APT.  Had occasional heart racing while doing some light snow shoveling 3 weeks after the vaccine, and it went away after that.  Chills off and on for about 10 days after to about 22 days after.  Also had loss of appetite about 2 weeks after the vaccine that lasted several days.  He also had a couple of days really poor sleep, irregular and several days that he had night mares 2-3 weeks after the vaccine.  A couple of weeks after the vaccine did not just feel very good, like he had the flu.  He also has had itching on the top of his feet and ankles that did not start until after the vaccine, and still has depending on what socks he&#39;s wearing.   He also had a swollen right ear that was real sore and had to go to the doctor to get the swelling down using some ear drops.

ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY, I HAD A PAIN IN MY LEFT ARM FROM THE INJECTION SITE DOWN THRU MY ELBOW JOINT AND CONTINUING ON TO MY LEFT WRIST.  I HAVE HAD THE PAIN EVER SINCE.  I DID NOT REALIZE THAT TIREDNESS, MUSCLE PAIN, JOINT PAIN AND FEELING UNWELL ALONG WITH DIZZINESS AND WEAKNESS  WERE SYMPTOMS OF A POSSIBLE REACTION TO THE VACCINE. SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS COULD BE FROM A PREVIOUS STROKE.

With these, his primary care provider was very much concerned, and he had a battery of tests done then he was discovered to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) on 22Jan2021. He informed that his primary care provider asked him to go into the office since the primary care provider was convinced that it was something more than just a reaction to the Pfizer covid vaccine.

Pain has affected his daily activities.  After several days of applying warm compresses and taking over the counter anti-inflammatory medications without relief, patient sought medical care.  Patient has since continued to follow up with Dr.  at the facility and is undergoing physical therapy sessions as well as new medications. As of today, 3/3/21, patient still has pain in his arm that limits daily acitivities.

It took me forty five minutes to get out of bed after numerous attempts.  I also experience dizziness, balance issues.  In all honesty, it was as if I had gotten Covid all over again.  I had it in late August and all of September.  The second day after the shot, I experienced lack of strength, but not as bad as the first day, and whole body muscle aches.  The third day after,  was about the same and after that, things started getting a  little better.

Uneasy sleep, awoke the following morning in a sweat, with overall discomfort and nausea, began to retch and vomit for nearly 13 hrs. throughout the only comfort was to sit in a hot shower till the hot water ran out sometime falling into a deep sleep, I did this many times through the day, Accompanying this was a general fog and complete loss of equilibrium, extreme weakness. this made it difficult to move from bed to bath or anywhere in my home. I am writing this at 5:13 am Mar  6 and find it hard to gather thoughts.

                                                Purkinje Tree and Covid-19 Vaccine. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and massively increased vaccinations, there have been few ocular side effects reported with the  vaccine. 1) However conjunctivitis has occurred with Covid-19 infection and very rarely endophthalmitis has been reported.  I wish to mention an otherwise unreported association with visualization of a Purkinje Tree and Pfizer Covid-19 second vaccine. I am a 73 year old otherwise healthy retired male. I had an entoptic experience after I received my second vaccine.  With the first vaccine I had no visual side effects.  The afternoon of my second dose I took an hour long  nap, which was unusual for me.  When I woke up and opened my eyes I noticed a bilateral arborizing, interlacing dark pattern that lasted less than a second. This was opaque but without a ghost image and otherwise the wall, sheet,  and ceiling were seen clearly behind that network.   I experimented with opening and shutting either and both eyes looking at a white sheet beneath me, and found that especially with my dominant left eye I saw a pattern resembling my left eye retinal vascular tree.  The branches originated as single vessels  superiorly and inferiorly that branched down to smaller vessels  all on the right side of a disc type structure without duplication into an identifiable arteriolar and  venous system. Even with a light source moving over my left shoulder,  the image never lasted longer than a fraction of a second and fatigued quickly with repetition.  I laid back down and repeated the experiment of opening and shutting either eye while looking at a white ceiling. Then the image changed to a horizontally oriented pattern with two single black vessel type structures coming off a disc type structure.  The dark lines further branched and narrowed as they extended to the right and left off the disc type structure.  Again this lasted less than a second. It faded away rather than floated away. The image always appeared in the same area of my field of vision. It was peri-central when I looked at the wall and inferior to fixation when I looked at the ceiling.   The image would immediately move with eye movement, unlike a vitreous floater. Opening and shutting my left eye could refresh the image very briefly but that fatigued with repetition and could not be reproduced after 3-4 trials or without several hours between attempts. I did  translations of Purkinje?s description of the Tree (described here later.)  and had short term  partial success with his methods, except for pushing on  my eye, and using galvanic current,  which I did not attempt.  I declined a full exam but did  remember a lecture about Purkinje images.  He had the residents hold pen lights to the side of their eyes and move the light back and forth while he  described the Purkinje Tree. Afterwards he quizzed the residents about whether they could see it or not, with the ?humorous? disclaimer that it was a means of IQ testing if they could see it.  Half could.  It was of interest to me that  before I retired,  occasionally patients would mentions seeing the tree after an ophthalmoscopic exam.  I hoped to delight those patients by  telling them it was a form of IQ quiz and they had done well.  Two weeks later I was disappointed that I could no longer see the tree, but again declined an exam.  I am optically conversant, but physically adverse in seeking self care.   Purkinje first described the ?Tree?2) in his doctorate thesis in 1819. It was included in descriptions of other entoptic phenomena, performed mostly on himself. This was before the ophthalmoscope was discovered and before quality histological, serial sections were available.  He described holding a candle or using galvanic illumination in front of his eyes individually and moving it around.  He could see  black lines in a network that came off a central pit structure.  There were two lines inferiorly and superiorly with adjacent shadows and ultimately had size reducing branches.  He recognized these branching lines as retinal blood vessels, but could not discern any blood flow.  In 1825 he published a further volume 3) that dealt with experiments he subsequently had performed.  He found that by holding a sheet of paper with a hole in it that he moved around,  he could get a better view of the blood vessel pattern.  He could discern the macula and described anastomosing blood vessels superior to inferior.  A significant improvement in his discerning the blood vessel pattern was obtained with a safe amount of pressure on the superior lateral aspect of the eye.  With this he could recognized blood corpuscles and flow patterns and then labeled the lines as veins. He did not describe arteriole patterns.  So this leaves us with the question why this sudden awareness of the Purkinje Tree appeared in the time frame of a second Covid-19 vaccine.  This will require further reports to determine coincidence versus cause-effect.  This is a high stress time with Covid-19 deaths so prevalent. I had immediate relief after my second shot with a reduction of tension and increase in awareness of my general physical status as in the feeling of being hot or cold, sleepy or just fatigued, improved calmness, and the pertinent Purkinje Tree.  At sign in for the second series of Pfizer injections the RN on duty asked about side effects from the first shot.  She asked us to send a report in of any potential side effect then of the second shot and notified us that people were having more problems with the second shot than the first. Arm soreness, swelling, fever, chills, headache,  malaise, fatigue.  She gave us a print out list of known side effects, mostly systemic and all mild, but nothing ophthalmic.  With these things  in mind I was especially vigilant of any thing new in my general health or condition.  Most of the patients getting the shots were students and the congregating area was in a wing of a hospital.  This brought back the pleasant memory of my time in training and  my chief?s description of Purkinje?s Tree and perhaps enhanced the  brief ability to see the entoptic image.  In between times playing with this image my vision was normal and  my general health remained good, without symptoms of vascular compromise.

                                                Vaccine #2 re-activated my Covid-19 aftereffects. Began with severe leg pains that night. Now, one week later, have severe pain/muscle spasms in both legs. Specifically biceps femoris and &#34;hamstring muscles.&#34;  Very &#34;stiff&#34; as well. Difficult (sometimes impossible) to bend down, very painful to walk.  Using a walker to get around. Taking gabapentin mentholated patches, occasional Aleve (naproxen) for pain.

Had no control of body functions and urinated all over myself. Could not get strength to get off the toilet. Needed help with that and back to bed. Fell on the way there. Wife was able to help me crawl back to bed. A few hours later had to urinate again, but could not get out of bed. No control no strength. Was half on the toilet and could not get myself straight on due to literally no body strength. Fell off the toilet, could not move at all. Had to call my son over to get me up. I was sick all day long. Later in the day I was able to get up a bit and walk but not steadily. Tylenol helped. Later that night I was feeling better. By the next day I was pretty well back to mysllf

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6204), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 04Mar2021 11:15 (at the age of 73-years-old), at 0.3 mL (30 mcg), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: service connected disability diagnosed from the (name withheld) for a lower back injury; last Spring and early Summer (2020) he went through treatment for 45 days with External beam radiation therapy (EBRT), which was 405 doses of radiation from a machine called FORD, had radiation treatment for early stage prostate cancer last year (2020);  had anaphylactic shock, rash, awful case of hives when in military service in response to shots then and stayed for half an hour until okay (The patient was unable to provide names of vaccines given in past in service since that was in 1969-1970&#39;s. At that time, they got the shots in big air guns and was shot 3-4 at a time. Had those 3-4 shots during his basic training. During that time, he woke up around midnight and had awful case of hives and was taken to the base hospital and was given adrenaline in one arm and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) in the other); allergies to sulfa drugs; diagnosed allergies (unspecified); compromised immune status; respiratory illness; genetic/chromosomal abnormalities; endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity); blood stools, rare occasion; glasses. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination or on the same day as the vaccination. The patient received the first dose on 04Mar2021 at about 11:15. He had not had much of a reaction, just a little soreness and soreness (04Mar2021). The soreness started that afternoon of getting the vaccine. When he went to sleep, he noticed the soreness was in right arm, so he didn&#39;t lay on that side. He noticed it enough to sleep on the other side. On 07Mar2021, the patient had bloody stools, which were a rare occasion in the past. The patient stated the blood was significant enough to draw his attention, almost felt like a blockage in the system. The patient &#34;sat on the pot&#34; for 15-20 minutes and broke into a sweat (07Mar2021). The patient did not know if he had bloody stool then, because he didn&#39;t turn on the light, but ever since then, it has been bloody. No BM&#39;s (bowel movement) since yesterday (09Mar2021). The patient was tired yesterday (09Mar2021). He just laid around all day on a heating pad. He had a dull ache in stomach since it started (07Mar2021). Still there today, but not that bad. The patient stated he had radiation treatment for early stage prostate cancer, they tried to prevent burning or damaging the rectum, but this could be related to that. On Sunday night (07Mar2021), about midnight, he got an awful, awful stomach pain that woke him up about midnight. He tried to move his bowels 2-3 times Sunday night (07Mar2021) and on Monday morning (08Mar2021) he was able to move them a little bit. His underwear he had from Sunday night had lots of red stains in them, and all day Monday (08Mar2021) he was having a bellyache. Every time he managed to move his bowels and it was bloody and seemed to get bloodier pretty much all day. Yesterday (09Mar2021), he laid on a heating pad and went to bed early about 20:30, he usually goes about 22:00. He managed to stay in bed for about 9 hours, and he usually can&#39;t sleep that long. He slept on his side. He started having dark thoughts (unspecified date Mar2021), stating that last Spring and early Summer he went through treatment for 45 days with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). On Monday night (08Mar2021), the patient had terrible cramps about midnight, with very cold sweat and diarrhea. The next morning (09Mar2021), every bowel movement was very bloody. Then all day Tuesday (09Mar2021) very lethargic. No more bowel movements until the following Friday. The patient stated he felt like I was trying to pass a blood clot. The patient stated he seemed to have problems with bowels all day yesterday (09Mar2021) and was not much better; he had really low energy (09Mar2021). Today (10Mar2021), he seemed to feel better, but not much. He had not eaten much (Mar2021) and was hesitant to put food in his system, since his system was not functioning very well. The patient had not been seen by doctor or in an emergency room. His wife was a retired nurse, and they have discussed if he was not better, they were going to call his primary care provider and urologist. The patient had coffee this morning (10Mar2021), and he barely touched it yesterday morning. So far, no bloody discharge, no discharge or bowel movements today. Three to four times in the night he did pass gas (Mar2021), and that was all that happened. The patient knew side effects were rare with this (vaccine) and unsure if these side effects were something reported; this was certainly unusual for him. The clinical outcome of bloody stools, dull ache in stomach, had really low energy, terrible cramps, very cold sweat, diarrhea, tired, and lethargic was recovering. The outcome of belly ache, decreased appetite, and gas, was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included migraine (diagnosed about 30 years ago), low hypotension, allergic to strawberries, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Concomitant medications included omeprazole taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease, sumatriptan taken for migraine and naproxen taken for migraine; start and stop dates were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 first dose on 09Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced four days after his second shot (06Mar2021), his migraines got more pronounced than normal which they expected, but then the migraines got so severe that it had occurred every single day. The reporter seriousness for migraine was medically significant. Migraine was reported as worsened. The caller stated that she was a registered nurse as well, she was calling about the Pfizer Covid vaccine. She spoke with the CDC on Saturday. Her fiance, he has a history of getting migraines for like the past 33 years. After the first dose on 09Feb2021, he then had the second on 02Mar2021. 4 days after the second dose, he got a migraine headache that was more severe than his usual and then it went away, then the next day after, he got another migraine headache, and he has been getting them everyday since then. He gets the headache once a day, for like a 12 hour duration then 8. Made attempt to clarify with the caller, she stated that for the 30 something years his migraines would occur once a week or twice a month, but now after the second dose it was daily. Currently the span of the migraine headache was shorter, it has gone from 12 hours to 8 hours. He was on sumatriptan and naproxen for his migraines, but now it takes the medication 1.5 hours to make the headache go away. They did a CAT scan and the result was normal. Both the first and second dose took place in the morning at 10AM or 10:30AM. After the second vaccine on 02Mar2021, his first migraine was on Saturday 06Mar2021. After stating his age, she stated that he&#39;s not old like the typical 73 year old. He sees a doctor at the VA for primary care and also has another primary care doctor outside of the VA. He has seen both for the migraines, caller stated that she would like to skip this section as her fiance was not there right now and doesn&#39;t know if he wanted to provide that. Migraine, it&#39;s usually on the right side of the head, in the temple, eye, cheek bone area, as well as a little bit around the hairline area. It was now every 8 hours a day, that he experiences the migraine for and it&#39;s getting worse and worse. Seriousness criteria: his medication before would take half hour, but now it&#39;s taking hour to hour and a half. His migraines were so severe that she recalls one time being in the car with him, and he actually has to hold the left side of his face, and put his head down. His primary doctor gave a shot called Aimovig and she guesses it takes a while to start working, it can take a couple weeks, it was suppose to be a preventative medication but it hasn&#39;t done anything yet, it hasn&#39;t kicked in yet. An as ER nurse for 30 years, she can tell his level of pain was more than 10 on a pain scale. Lot number was unknown, the vaccine card was physically with her fiance, she does not have it at this moment. When queried anatomical location of vaccine, sounding unsure she stated that he got one on the right arm and one on the left arm. Caller stated that she will try calling him on the other phone and see if he can answer, he carries the vaccine card with him. Causality was related, because this started 4 days after the second shot and has not stopped. It&#39;s not like a typical migraine. He takes a medication on and off for GERD called omeprazole. He was diagnosed with low hypotension, they put him on metoprolol but the doctor said that he might as well not take it since his blood pressure goes low. The CAT scan was normal and was done 2 weeks ago at the end Mar2021. He gets blood work every 6 month, the last one was a couple months ago and it was fine. Lot and expiry for sumatriptan, naproxen, and Aimovig were unknown, they were not physically with her at the moment. Facility of vaccine administration: it&#39;s not a military facility, it&#39;s a grocery store with pharmacy inside. He has not had to go to the ER. He did have a physician appointment however, he did not specifically see the doctors for the migraine, it was an appointment that was already annually schedule as he see&#39;s the doctor every 6 months. At the doctor&#39;s appoint he did tell (name) how bad the migraines were. He was really highly ranked in the military so his pain tolerance was pretty high, to see him double over with headache was unbelievable. He has had no other vaccines on the same day or in the 4 week period prior getting the Covid vaccine. He has had no issues with vaccines in the past. Treatment was Aimovig injection, it&#39;s a once a month injection, but she understood that it can take up to weeks for it to actually work. As an ER nurse, she has seen people with a headache and say their pain level was 10 but you know it&#39;s not, but in her fiance&#39;s case it was definitely 10&#43;, they were also closer together in frequency and it worries her. At the end of the call, she asked that his doctor at VA mentioned the vaccines works with the immune system and can cause inflammation, caller asked if this was true. The outcome of the event was not recovered.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported migraine cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), dose 1 intramuscular on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 vaccination; adalimumab (HUMIRA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1132646) to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose, subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1136949) to Mar2021, at unspecified dose for moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.  The patient medical history includes ear infection. Concomitant medications were not reported. On unknown dates, the patient experienced tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles and whole left side of face and eye swollen. In 2021, the patient experienced infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy and whole left side of face and eye swollen. On 02Mar2021, the patient experienced felt weakness and chills. On 08Apr2021, the patient experienced substantial bubble of pus under arm. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit. In Apr2021, the substantial bubble of pus under arm resolved. On unknown dates, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears and whole left side of face and eye swollen resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. In Feb2021, the patient saw his physician twice for an ear infection. On 01Mar2021, the patient got his first vaccine shot. The next day he had chills and fever and feeling of weakness the next day. He went away after a short time and he felts better. He went to the physician twice in the past two weeks for minor infections especially in his ears. The tissue inside his ear dried up and bleeding. On the first visit he had a fever due to the infection in the ear. His physician prescribed antibiotic for a week. He got another infection in the same ears. He was painful when touched it. He went back to physician and physician prescribed another anitbiotic. The physician said the infections were to be expected with Humira because Humira weakens immune system. Partly because of his age. His age may be a contributing factor as well. He agrees to have physician contacted. On 29Mar2021 to 1Apr2021, he was in the hospital his infection started in his ear lobe that migrated to his whole left side of his face. His eye was swollen and felt pain on top of his head. His Temp of 105 when he went in. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics. He was tested to make sure infection had not spread to blood or bones. The Humira might have played a role because it lowers the bodies resistance to infection. They asked him not to take the Humira for two Saturdays. He did not take Humira on 09Apr2021 or before. He was stable. His skin was cracking up. Thought it might be shingles. He was prescribed an oral antibiotic first time, but then a week and a half later, it acted up again and he went back and got a different antibiotic and that worked until it. He was feeling completely better since he got out of the hospital. He had more energy than he had in a while. He had been feeling low energy for a while due to the infection. His physician did not think he should stop taking Humira but if he got a fever he needs to investigate immediately to see if he needs to hospitalized. In 08Apr2021, he had substantial bubble of puss under his arm. He gave him a steroid injection to control that. On 10Apr2021, he had thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of his armpit and he thinks that was the end of it. On 11Apr2021, he had his second Covid vaccine manufactured by Moderna then after he was released from the hospital. He was no issues or reactions with either injection. He was careful when he went out around people. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. The action taken in response to the events adalimumab was not applicable. The outcome of event infection in ear lobe, eye swelling and swelling face recovered in 2021, weakness and chills and fever recovered in Mar2021, ear infection and pain localised recovered on unspecified date, Axillary abscess/substantial bubble of puss under arm recovered in Apr2021; event ear bleeding was recovering; event fluid discharge, skin fissures and shingles was unknown.  The reporter&#39;s causality for adalimumab (Humira) on the events infection in ear lobe, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset with Humira (Adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of felt weakness and chills with Humira (Adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, skin was cracking up and possible shingles was not provided.  Opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab). Opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of felt weakness, chills, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset and tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pfizer comment: The serious events Ear lobe infection and Condition aggravated were considered as unlikely related to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of BNT162b2 cannot be completely excluded for the non-serious asthenia, pyrexia and chills, which occurred in a close temporal relation, namely, one day after the  first dose BNT162B2 injection. The other reported events were confirmed as non-serious, while the causality was confounded by ADALIMUMAB administration. The infectious events were to be expected with co-suspect due an immunosuppression activity with increased infection susceptibility, such as Herpes zoster and Ear lobe infection aggravated, in this case. Furthermore, swelling face and eye swollen with unknown onset in 2021 may be attributable to the co-suspect and unrelated to the vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A male patient of an unspecified age received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Lot Number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 13Mar2021, single for the prevention of corona virus. Medical history included high blood pressure and allergy to penicillin both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s fiance and the patient took their first Pfizer Covid shot on 13March2021 and within 4 minutes the patient started showing symptoms of everything. The patient had his shot on his left arm, his whole left side of his body went numb. He was asked &#34;are you allergic to anything&#34; and he said he cannot have Penicillin. The reporter stated that event on the day of the report, the patient still has the numbness down in his foot, his toe and on his left side but also originally within 4 minutes he was sat down and also within 12 minutes he was throwing up and they could not figure out what was wrong, he did &#34;fall on the ground&#34; (as reported, not further clarified). The patient was experiencing, not as strong but still experiencing, tingly and shingles and originally was numb. The patient is concerned about it. The patient only took the first one because that was on the Saturday and on Monday he went to the doctor and the doctor suggested to not take the second one because his blood pressure turned dropping, he does have the blood pressure and it was 107/70. The reporter said that the patient has allergy and since of that all he had anaphylactic reaction because he is allergic to Penicillin (as reported, pending clarification). He had tingling and shingles after the shot. He was very cold and sweaty and &#34;creepy&#34; (as reported not further clarified). The reporter called the nurse and they took over to have his blood pressure and it was 107/70. The reporter also added that just 4 minutes after the shot he had headache and dizziness and numbness bottom of his left foot and his toe, tingling under his foot and numbness under his toe.

                                                The next morning I felt chills, really cold, my arm never hurt at all. I was freezing. I had no energy. Very lethargic, with a blanket around me. Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time. I lost 17 lbs and if I try to walk my lungs shut down. ( I went to the ER n 01/07 and was discharged on the 17th - I was also at the ER the week before when they tested me and it kept coming back negative) My pulmonary MD

                                                Fever; Chills; his face was burning up; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021), via unspecified route of administration on left arm on 22Jan2021 at 08:15 AM at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The relevant medical history included three stents in his heart, allergy and medication for cholesterol (he just quit the medication, it was killing his legs). They have tried him on them 99 times but he cannot take statin drugs, they cripple him. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient previously took Claritin (doesn&#39;t know if he took this for food or medication allergies, he thought it was for sinus drainage most of it). The patient said he got his COVID shot and had a fever of 102 and he had chills with it too on 22Jan2021. He said he was wondering what he was supposed to do to get that fever down, which he clarified it was 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The fever started by the time he got back, it was a 2.5-3 hours drive, his wife checked his temperature about 5 minutes prior for the first time, because his face was burning up. He says that the NDC is not written on the vaccine card with the other handwritten information, it did say he went back 12Feb for the second one. He had not started any new medications or received any recent vaccinations. The patient underwent lab test included temperature elevation which showed 102.4 degrees Fahrenheiton on 22Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

Developed pain in my abdomen area quite noticeable 4 days later.  6 days later had major pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea.  Went to ER morning of the 7th day....spent 4 days in hospital.  Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

                                                It is three weeks since I received the first vaccine and am scheduled for the second one in six more days. I am worried that my arm still aches after so many weeks. Don&#39;t know which arm I should get the second vaccine in. Everything I read says that the ache should have passed in less than two weeks.

This 74-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered on the arm left on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;maybe I don&#39;t know 6198, it&#39;s GN or EN&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, broken back, breathing problem because of his heart and lung, his lungs have problem, he had some nodules in it, and kidney stone once 25 years ago, 5 little stones. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a reaction, it is the worst reaction he has ever had in his life, the pain he had, he was almost paralyzed and couldn&#39;t walk after vaccine and he had to get a wheelchair because he couldn&#39;t stand on his feet. He ended up in the emergency room. The vaccine put him out of work, and now he can work some. He is trying to make it up in two days, today and tomorrow to finish up. He was very upset and wanted to know why this happened to him. The patient stated that other people he talked to had no reaction, if they had a fever or anything it was gone in a coupled days, but he ended up in the emergency room. On 01Mar2021, patient had his first dose and at 02:30, he got out of the facility and came out okay with no problem. At 21:00, all of a sudden he saw that he could not stand up on his feet and he fell awake. He waited in the bed, people around him got worried. Eventually, he asked them to bring wheelchair, maybe he can drive. He drove home with his wife to the emergency from his house and he got admitted in emergency and he was screaming so bad, he did not believe in his life, he never heard somebody doing like this. He felt like somebody getting chills like somebody cutting his side, on his lower abdomen on the right side. It&#39;s underside of the lower abdomen, he had slight pain every single day, sometime excruciating, he took Ibuprofen for it. He thought he had a kidney stone because he had it once 25 years ago, 5 little stones, so they took him to emergency, took him to the CT scan. They didn&#39;t find anything, but the pain was excruciating and in the emergency room everybody thought the crazy man is here who is screaming. He couldn&#39;t control his scream. He couldn&#39;t walk, he couldn&#39;t move. Every movement was like you put a knife on the cutting, it was that bad. His second dose was due on 22Mar2021. He went to the pharmacy and asked them the number and let them know that he had a reaction like this and they called somebody and said to cancel the shot. They cancelled it. That day for 3 days, patient had the pain, it was slowly because he had to take eventually oxycodone. The doctor advised in the emergency room that nothing was wrong, just to slow down the pain but he was not allowed to take the oxycodone. He took the 10 mg oxycodone and the pain which was an hour and a half was a little bit down. After 3 hours, it was a little better, he didn&#39;t want to scream, it was gone but the pain was still there for at least 3 days, really bad. He was taking ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant. He did all those things and still I have the pain left and he did not know what to do with that. The lab test he had, he had been okay, he did not have any problem. He got the result on 22Mar2021. Outcome of the events pain and abdominal pain was not recovered and of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 74years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL9262) on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 74years) for Covid-19 immunization and stated no reactions. Medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes but are all currently under control and feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered. It was reported that in the past the doctors thought he experienced TIA (transient ischemic attack) but wasn&#39;t sure if that was accurate. Concomitant medications included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL), trazodone (TRAZODONE), insulin (INSULIN), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and prednisone (PREDNISONE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that on 19Feb2021 the patient received the 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and stated he remember feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered earlier. On Sunday 21Feb2021, the reporter (patient&#39;s wife) began noticing that the patient was showing symptoms of a stroke. The patient&#39;s one leg was rapidly kicking, and his speech began to slur. The patient was then rushed to ER (emergency room) and hospitalized. At the hospital it was confirmed that the patient was having a stroke. The patient recovered and was doing rehab for his leg. Few weeks later, the patient had an accident in his home while getting up to go to the bathroom and fell. The patient was rushed to the Trauma center. The patient&#39;s wife was upset as she carried their vaccine cards to the trauma center to confirm to staff that the patient did not need another Covid vaccine shot and later found out that the patient was given a 3rd (Moderna Covid vaccine) at the trauma center. The patient stated that he does not think the vaccine was related but was upset that the trauma center did not listen to her to take the info with the complete vaccine card present to avoid 3rd shot from another brand. The patient&#39;s insulin levels are under control, but the reporter was concerned when the patient does not eat within a certain timeframe. The outcome of events stroke and speech disorder was recovered on an unspecified date; outcome of event fall was unknown.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: LE3301), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 12Jan2021 at 15:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included belief that he had agent orange and tiredness. The patient did not have additional vaccines administered on the same date as the Pfizer vaccine and did not have vaccinations within four weeks. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received a flu shot in October (year unspecified). On 12Jan2021, the patient was throwing up. The patient stated that his whole body has gone, it did not work anymore, his legs have gone out, and was having headaches on 13Jan2021. The patient initially stated that the feeling that his body did not work anymore started six hours after he got the vaccine. He later clarified and stated it started on 13Jan2021. He further clarified that what he meant by the body did not work was issues with his lower extremities, he cannot walk and he was having a lot of headaches. The throwing up started on the evening of 12Jan2021. He could not get up to go to the bathroom. He had a couple of episodes of throwing up. He confirmed the throwing up has resolved, but was unable to provide any additional details. He also added that he was feeling very cold on 13Jan2021. The headaches left him concerned. At end of the call, the patient indicated he wanted this bad feeling to go away. The events did not require any visit to the Emergency Room or Physician&#39;s office (patient stated he considered it, but he just stayed in bed). Outcome of the event throwing up was recovered, for the events body does not work anymore, very cold, and headache was not recovered, while for the other events was unknown.

A 75-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 04:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the vaccine on 12Jan2021 Tuesday afternoon, other than his arm hurting on 13Jan2021 Wednesday morning, which was gone now (15Jan2021), he had no headache or any other symptoms. Then, he woke up today (15Jan2021), and the crown of his head was tender and he wanted to know if there was a correlation to the vaccine. He was not ill or anything and it may be just a coincidence. The outcome of the event arm hurting was recovered on 15Jan2021 and unknown for the other event.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

Seems to have gotten worse since Monday when he had his first Covid vaccine here at the hospital.  Denies any headaches or neck pain.  No fevers or chills.  No cough or shortness of breath.  No abdominal pain.  No vomiting or diarrhea.  No black or bloody stools.  No dizziness.  Today he almost fell and the son had to catch him.  He did not suffer any trauma.  He offers no symptoms of pain.  Here he is fully awake and alert.  Nothing to clinically suspect a stroke.  His vitals are stable.  Chest x-ray shows nothing acute.  Creatinine is better than baseline.  Electrolytes are stable.  Troponin reassuring.  He had no chest pain or shortness of breath to suspect angina.  Spoke to the wife via telephone, he is getting so weak that he was unable to walk.  Paramedics report they had lift him as he could not take a step.  He was unable to ambulate here in the emergency room.  At this time it does not seem like I can safely discharge him home.

This 75 years old male consumer received the first single dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9261) on 28Jan2021 at 09:50, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was a disable war veteran; the Military gave him the COVID vaccine. Medical history included malaria (and another unspecified condition during his military service, they used &#34;IVs to bring him back&#34; and he even had a spinal tap, he was also in &#34;a coma, on his way out to the next&#34; and they said he was shaking like a leaf on the tree), skin problems (he had already been under the (government organization) care of malaria and skin problems), prostate problems, back problems since the war, he was still in a back brace for his back problems (he had been wearing it since the 60&#39;s), major spinal surgery in Mar2019 where his L1 and L5 were taken out (he lost a lot of fluid as a result of this surgery). Since they took his L1-L5, he had no real body control of his lower extremities and due to this he was awarded money from the (government organization). The patient received an unspecified influenza vaccine in the past, on an unknown date, for immunization. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 12Feb2021 at 03:30 AM, the patient experienced fever, he described his body was warm and getting warmer and warmer and was sweating. He was at a feverish point, his sheets he was sweating and wet from his back to feet. He also had chills. He got up thinking this reaction was from the COVID vaccine, he had an Enurse drink in his fridge and took powdered acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and then he laid there and let his body go through the changes. He knew that his body can recover from heat. He went to sleep, woke up and had no more chills; he was sweating, but it was gone, his body was normal, he was under the covers. It was like how his normal body just took it like penicillin, it did the same thing. The events resolved on 12Feb2021 at 07:00 AM. His second vaccine dose was schedule on 18Feb2021 at 9:50 AM.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 02Mar2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 75-years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dizziness, hyperuricemia (he produces too much uric acid and it causes kidney stones), back pain, COVID-19 in Dec2020 and was cleared by the end of Dec2020. Ongoing concomitant medications included diazepam for dizziness since 1978, allopurinol for hyperuricemia, oxycodone hydrochloride/paracetamol (PERCOCET) for back pain since 7-8 years ago. There were no other vaccines administered on the same day or within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9262) on 09Feb2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 75-years-old) in the left arm and experienced muscle aches.

On 03Mar2021 at 07:00 he was paralyzed in his arms and legs- he could feel his muscles but couldn&#39;t make them move. He just laid there for ten hours, and it was scary, and he thought that over a period of time the vaccine would get filtered out. After that, he was fully recovered and able to move. The events did not require a visit to the physician or the emergency room. The patient was concerned that he got the second shot too soon after having COVID-19 in Dec2020. The clinical outcome of legs were weak and paralyzed in his arms and legs was resolved on 03Mar2021, severe shivers was resolved on 04Mar2021.
