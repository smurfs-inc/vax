The patient &#34;came to&#34; within approximately a minute?  Patients mother and I were able to lay Patient down on the floor. I asked his mother if she would like us to call 911 and she said yes.  Prior to the incident, I discussed Patients past history of seizures with his mother. She sail he had seizures when he was younger and had been on medication, but he was no longer on any medication and had been seizure free for approximately 5 years.

                                                From ED Note: 12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.   Mom notes that he was in his usual state of health when he presented to COVID clinic to get his first vaccine. He got the Pfizer vaccine, seconds after getting in his left arm, mom noted that he looked very &#34;wide eyed&#34; and distraught.  She notes that he slumped forward and had lost consciousness for approximately 5 seconds.  She noticed shaking movements in his right arm and bilateral lower legs.  She notes that his left arm was against her and therefore cannot comment on it.  She notes that his eyes were closed.  No tongue biting and no incontinence.  No secondary trauma.  She notes that when these 5 seconds were over he then had a period for about 30 minutes where he looked pale and was breathing heavy but was alert and answering questions.  She notes that he has had presyncopal episodes and episodes of feeling faint when getting flu shots in the past.  However, this time she noted that he had shaking which made her nervous for possible seizure activity.  Patient denies any chest pain or headache prior to the symptoms.  She came via ambulance for further evaluation.   On arrival, he reports that he feels 90% back to his baseline.  He notes that he does not feel quite ready to run around yet however denies any pains or discomforts, headache, weakness, numbness, or tingling.   He had eaten a full breakfast prior to getting the shot.  He had a normal night sleep and a normal day yesterday per mom.   Medical History: as above  Surgical history: none Family History: Reviewed and no pertinent related family hx pertaining to this visit Social History: Lives with family  Allergies: food allergies  Medications: flovent, epi-pen Immunizations: Up to date  Medical Decision Making  12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.  On arrival, he was alert, well-appearing, in no acute distress.  His vital signs were normal for age on room air.  His physical exam was very reassuring as above with a normal neurologic and cardiac evaluation.   Differential includes vasovagal/syncope in the setting of a known stressful trigger vs seizure given report of shaking in his extremities.  We feel the latter is significantly less likely given the timeline of the events.  Has no known seizure activity nor any triggers per history (fever, trauma, etc.).  He also has a normal neurologic assessment. At this time we will defer neurology consults given low concern for seizure.  It is possible that this represents a side effect of the vaccine however we also feel that this is less likely given the fact that his symptoms have been seconds after receiving the vaccine.  Nonetheless we reported the symptoms to the pharmacist who recorded it in the database.  We attained an EKG showing a known incomplete right bundle branch block (unchanged from 2013) and a slightly prolonged QTC of 477 (previously 451).    I encourage patient to stay well-hydrated, well rested in the setting of his suspected syncopal episode this morning.  I also suggested that for further vaccinations, that he lay down on the table and drink/eat well prior.  We provided strict return to ED criteria in the setting of worsening symptoms. All questions were answered at the time of discharge. Mom verbalized her understanding and agreement of the plan. He was discharged in a stable condition with mom at side.    **After patient was discharged, cardiology called the follow-up team due to the prolonged QTC to ensure that we were aware.  I contacted the patient&#39;s PCP to do a follow-up EKG in 1 month&#39;s time.

                                                After vaccine was administered,  patient was asked to wait for 15 minutes, at which time Parent notices that child had passed out, looked pale and unresponsive to name calling. I (pharmacist) was alerted to the event and I and couple technicians went out to assist patient.  I elevated child&#39;s feet,  supported head, took blood pressure and pulse. Child regained consciousness and was able to respond to name in less than two minutes. Child stated that he was hot and agreed to drinking cold water. I also applied cold compress to child&#39;s forehead and wrists. Child took sips of water and BP was continuously monitored. Parents stated that child looked much better and had regained color to his face. Child was monitored to 30 mins by the pharmacy team with no event before parents took child home.

                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

Was taken via EMS to the hospital, with clinical assessment showing no neurological deficit, withdrawing to pain, and patient demonstrated ability to ambulate independently about 12 hours after symptom onset. CBC, CMP, Urinalysis, UDS unremarkable.

At 1302 he stated that he stated tapping his face and trying to speak.  He began to have a right sided glance again and his pupils dilated to an 9 again and we equal and non reactive. he did not respond to his name.  This lasted for almost 2 mins. He then stated he was foggy and his pupils returned back to a 6 and were equal and reactive.  He was struggling to find sounds in the room.

More worrisome was the heart pain he woke up with in the middle of the night and throughout the day on 5/20. He complained of a sharp stabbing pain on left side of his chest and said it was hard to take a deep breath. I gave him ibuprofen and he rested. I called his doctor and they said not to worry, these side effects were normal. I?m a bit nervous for him to get the second vaccine  since he had the chest pain side effects as to why I?m reporting this. I?m surprised they give the same dose to a 80lb child, they do to a 200 lb grown man.

He barely managed to say that his throat felt like something burning hot was pouring down. I immediately gave him cold water to drink. He drank and continued to drink in small sips for the next hour and was feeling normal in an hour. He had not eaten or drank anything after his vaccine. He had also had lunch at 3 pm, a full 2 hours before the vaccine.

Followed by runny nose, sore throat, croup sounding cough, shortness of breath, gasping, chest pains, vomiting, back of the skull pain. He described the head pain as a square from the base of the back of his skull to the crown of his head and back down. Felt more like a pressure in the bones of his skull and less like a standard headache. The chest pains are sharp and come on sporadically. At first they were accompanied by hacking cough but then progressed to sharp chest pains at random times especially when lying down.  He has difficulty sleeping and staying asleep. Also, lower abdominal pain but no vowel issues.

                                                The next morning he woke up with arm  hurting him (he couldn&#39;t lift it). He felt a little warm - had a low grade fever -99.something. He had a headache all day. He was very sluggish, tired. He did online school that day. He took a nap and laid down on the couch in between classes. He was really tired. I was giving him Tylenol every four hours. The first time he felt a little better, The second time, it didn&#39;t work. I called the doctor for advice and he told me to give him Children&#39;s Motrin. That seemed to do better. I gave that to him once that day.  The next morning, he felt better. I gave him a Motrin anyway  because he had a light headache. He did say he felt some heart racing. And he was a little tired. He called me from school around 11:30 am and he said that his heart has been racing through the whole morning - he was gym and said  he couldn&#39;t run or anything but his heart was racing. I told him to go to t he school nurse - he had a pulse of 120. I met him there and I called the pediatrician and he saw him at 03:00. His pulse was high but not as high as before. He had rested in between. My son did see a cardiologist in June 2020- they put him on a heart monitor and she couldn&#39;t find anything at that time. At the regular doctor on the 19th, the doctor checked breathing and heart but did not have the materials at that location to do an EKG but said with the lowered heart rate just to watch and if it goes up again to go to Cardiologist we saw in June 2020. He rested some more and it went away on it&#39;s own. After that he was fine and no other issues. In fact, the next day he felt better and was running around and had energy and felt great.

Immediately threw up when he woke up Friday. Threw up again about 30 min. later and 4 more times during the day. Still having bad head pain. Started to become confused and say things that didn&#39;t make sense. Went to ER around 4:30pm Saturday June 5. Blood work showed his sodium level was dangerously low. He was immediately given sodium and transported to Hospital ICU. Had brain MRI, lumbar puncture and lots of blood work done. Brain MRI showed signs of encephalitis. Also had myocarditis.

On 6/13/2021, woke up with  central chest pain and &#34;fluttering&#34; of his heart. Mother read the Agency website concerning possible myocarditis after Covid vaccinations so then took him to the ED.  The chest pain lasted about an hour (resolved in triage in the ED). There he had a normal ECG and chest x-ray. He was referred to see me in clinic on 6/15/2021. He had a normal echocardiogram. Due to the parental concern for possible myocarditis, I recommended a troponin which would show if his chest pain were possibly related to that. It returned mildly elevated at 0.21 ng/mL, prompting me to enter this as a possible mild case of myocarditis after vaccination.

About 14 hours after revax he had a seizure in the middle of the night, which he reported to his mother the next morning.  He also had fever that next day lasting about 24 hours.  His mother reasoned his seizure was due to fever since his last seizure was 150 days ago and he had been well-controlled on 2 meds.  She presented today for 2nd vaccination, (technically 3rd dose of Pfizer) expressing concerns about another seizure.  She was advised to consult his neurologist,  for guidance and was advised vaccine will be available if/when she and the doctor deem it safe to give.

Extenuating headaches after Pfizer vaccine,  seems the vaccine has triggered a  prolonged immune response we have yet been able to stop.  Constant daily headache same area requiring more medication and lasting longer, some days after first does of tylenol he will need a 2nd dose of ibuprofen 4/5 hours later as the headache with first does of pain meds did not remove the headache. , achy pressure pain same with each headache, not sever pain but moderate and affects daily movements and activities as to not escalate the pain further,  drinking multiple bottles of water and trying to stay hydrated along with medications trying to remedy the prolonged headache from the vaccine . Drs have very limited information on how to treat or handle prolonged headaches from vaccination, information on these events or recommended treatments not easily found.

Took it easy for the next 4-5 days and just stayed home and in bed. When it got really bad, took a dose of ibuprofen.  The symptoms slowly got better and disappeared. Took about three doses of ibuprofen total over a few days. Talked to our pediatrician a week later who said we should report this.

A 12-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jun2021 at the age of 12 years old (Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were unknown) as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on an unspecified date at the age of 12 years old, dose 1 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 08Jun2021 at 20:00, the patient experienced extremely high fever that led to a seizure. The adverse event did result in an emergency room/department or urgent care. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of extremely high fever that led to a seizure, which included emergency medical services (EMS) support, paracetamol (TYLENOL), and ice bath. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

We walked around the store, conversed, and 10-12 minutes after injection he had syncope and generalized tonic clonic seizure for minutes. We were transported 911 to Hospital ED where he had normal labs, normal brain MRI, and consultation with Peds Neuro. He was post-ictal for 30&#43; minutes to follow the incident. He has secondary trauma to his R temporal and occipital bones and likely a mild concussion resulting from the fall.

Had him sit, take off his mask, gave him water to sip, took BP (102/60), within 5 minutes he started to come back around, was able to follow command (wiggle fingers) vocalize that he could breathe fine, and felt that there was water behind his ears. His temperature to touch seemed to start to go back down, and once paramedics arrived they evaluated him and released him as &#34;ok&#34; within 10 minutes.

I measured the patient blood pressure and it seems lower than normal. After the patient rest for a while I reassess the patient blood pressure and he seemed to feel a lot better. I asked the family to stay for additional 15 mins or 20 mins to observe him but they insist on leaving . I instructed the parents to observe him and if he gets worst get medical help. I have a staff member at the facility to call the family after 30 mins later and the parents stated he is moving around and feel a lot better.  The parents also called back a few hours later and stated he is doing good.

I nudged him to see if he was okay and he couldn&#39;t lift his head up all he said was &#34;I hate you&#34; (he didn&#39;t want the shot and I had a feel well)  I kept nudging him to go inside and he didn&#39;t react.  Finally after 25 min I had my brother in law carry him upstairs.  He didn&#39;t wake up for it (the kid is 13 that never happens).  Every hour I checked on him and he wouldn&#39;t wake up.  I am a nurse do figured the shot made him tired but I did start to get anxious I even sternal rubbed him and he reacted to pain but would not wake up.  Finally around 445 I told my husband we need to make him drink something and I stood him up he would not wake up.  I was trying everything but we got him up enough to gulp down some gatorade.  We put on his sneakers and he basically sleptwalked down the stairs went right to car and fell asleep again.  It was like he was too tired to stay awake.  We got him home and around 515 kept him sitting up in kitchen.  Took him about 20 min to fully open eyes and wake up.    When he was fully awake he said it was like the shot moved from his arm to his whole body when it happened and that was it.  He was sore and achy after that and even today to generalized body.  But he was fine as far as not lethargic after.

                                                Patient took his daily Zyrtec for environmental allergies and that was 4 hours prior to vaccine. He started complaining at 12:22 am on May 15, 2021 (13 hours after vaccine of a slight headache. We did not have Tylenol so gave him 4 chewable aspirins. Shortly after taking the aspirins, i.e. 20 minutes he started having involuntarily muscle tremors in his legs. I gave him 20 ml of Benadryl at 1:04 am and by 1:16 the tremors stopped and he told us that he felt completely fine. He slept soundly after the Benadryl. I think he is allergic to aspirin as he has never had it before.

                                                My son experienced under his left arm he had swelling of lymph nodes, on the middle of his armpit. The next day it was bigger and it was tender to touch, very painful. He also had some swollen lymph nodes on his neck, left side, near the collar bone and side of his ear. His lymph nodes got bigger on Saturday, the one on his left arm was getting smaller and the one on his neck today is going down in size as well.  My son was by a nurse practitioner, and she said that my son did not have any fever, he said it was consistent with the vaccine he received.   To this day his lymph nodes are still present but getting smaller in size.

                                                While giving a Pfizer Covid vaccine today, a patient appeared to be fine but after a few minutes suddenly passed out and had a short 3-4 second seizure on the ground. He did hit his head and appeared to be hypoxic. We called 911 immediately and informed store management. The paramedics asked him to walk off on his own power, but they did offer to escort the family to Hospital which I believe was accepted. His mother and sister were present too.

His eyes were rolling back,  he was shaking and his throat was making abnormal movements. His mother rushed over and bear-hugged him, and its like he came back to reality and was okay. We got him a cold pack, water, fruit snacks, a mat to lay on and a fan and the patient walked out okay. His reaction was directly after the shot and lasted about 5-10 seconds. Patient walked out of the facility fine and had his mother with him.

He received his 2nd Pfizer Covid vaccine on 6/12 and began having symptoms the next night. He began taking ibuprofen for headache and fever. His symptoms worsened through the day until he had vomiting. He was saying strange things and behaving oddly. He became very hot and agitated at home, prompting mom to bring him into an outside hospital ED.  There, rectal temperature was 106F and he was noted to be combative.  A CMP was obtained, which was mostly normal. CT of his head was obtained, during which he had an episode of left upper extremity shaking concerning for seizure. He was reportedly alert throughout.   Patient is a 13 yo M with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents with 1 day of fever, headache, altered mental status, vomiting, found to have cerebral edema and elevated CRP. There is no acidosis, elevated lactate, or metabolic derangement, and utox is neg. The etiology could be related to the vaccine. Ingestions are also possible given the high fever and altered mental status - particularly serotonin syndrome. Infectious etiologies are also possible given the fever.

                                                My son received his 1st shot of the vaccine on 5/15/21 lot # ew0177. On 5/27/21, my wife found my son in his bedroom unresponsive to verbal commands. He was dazed and confused and stared off into space when my wife tried to talk to him.  After a minute or so, he stood up and tried to walk but he was staggering and ended up fainting and falling down. My wife took my son to the emergency room. The doctors examined him and ran blood tests, including a tox screen, but could find nothing wrong with him.  We followed up with his family doctor the following week and she found nothing wrong other than dehydration.   On 6/5/21, my son received his 2nd dose of the vaccine lot #ew0202. On 6/11/21, my son had a major seizure at home with convulsions, was unresponsive and had to be taken from our home by ambulance to the hospital.  The emergency room doctors performed a CT Scan and other tests and again could find no reason for the seizure.  My son has been healthy his entire life and has never experienced anything like this before.  My son is very active with travel soccer and in very good health.  I do not know if the vaccine was the cause of these two episodes  but it seems to be the only common thread

                                                This is a dangerous shot. My son woke up early in the morning in terrible pain and in a cold sweat. This has NEVER happened before! Then he fainted. The next day he was still sick, fainted again and hit his head, needed stitches next to his eye and had a mild concussion from it. He could have been blinded in that eye. This website was a goose chase to get to! There are probably tons of parents who can?t report the adverse reactions their kids are suffering because of how complicated it is to even figure out where to report it. You should be ashamed of this process which lends itself to the under reporting of adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccinations!

A 13-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0167, expiry date: Aug2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13May2021 at 12:15, as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and other allergies compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity were none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no family medical history relevant to AE. The patient received no other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. On 13Jan2021 at 20:00, 8 hours after getting the shot, the patient experienced tonsils started hurting. He didn&#39;t feel well and had headaches. On 14Jan2021, he had some pretty bad symptoms on Saturday morning, he woke up with herpes zoster on his lips and his mother called to pediatrician and he was very dismissive about it and said that if the body was under stress it can come out, but he never had anything like this before. It looks like little pustules around his mouth and looks like when my mom had shingles. He did mention his arm hurt a little but went to soccer practice. Clarifies the herpes zoster didn&#39;t show up until Saturday evening/night and it was starting to go away. She took son to get Covid PCR testing on 14Jan2021 and it was negative and was told that the herpes zoster was probably a reaction to the vaccine. The patient received treatment with Abreva. The outcome of the events Since the first dose he woke up with what mother states is herpes zoster on his lips was not recovered, and the other event feeling horrible was unknown, and all other events was recovering.   PSCC Communication: PC Filed Product Complaint: Yes, Description of Product Complaint: Description of complaint: Asks if this could be a bad one since he was so sick and took him to get Covid PCR testing and it was negative. Thought was weird since she and her husband both had the Pfizer Covid shot and did not have any reactions. This was son&#39;s first Covid vaccine, Lot number: EW0167, expiry.

A few hours later after completing his morning therapies he showered and went to take a nap. At this time he was febrile to 103.6.  At 1600 he had seizure-like activity with trunk and upper extremity shaking as well as eyes rolling back and drooling.  Parents put him in car and transported him to an outside hospital. He did stop seizing prior to getting to that hospital.  Parents reported seizure lasted approximately 15 minutes with no loss of bowel or bladder control.  By time he arrived at local emergency room he was back at his neurological baseline. At the outside hospital our PICU was consulted and he was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin in meningitic dosing.

Urologist felt this was not a case of torsion and discharged us with diagnosis of &#34;inflammation&#34;.  We follow up with pediatric urologist tomorrow. Symptoms have improved with Ibuprofen, but testicle is still sore to touch.  No obvious heat, swelling, or redness.  Just extremely sore to touch and move testicle around.

Patient didn&#39;t sit on regular chair to sit closer to sister and mom. After a few minutes patient got lightheaded and fainted falling back and to the right, hitting head against wall and blood pressure machine and floor. Mom and sister tried to catch patient during fall. Patient had light shaking for a few seconds before becoming conscious again. I went out and called 911 for paramedics, lifted patient legs up to improve blood flow to head. After a few minutes and after finishing call with 911 had other employees help lift child onto regular chair to sit. Patient got a small bottle of water to drink. Paramedics soon arrived after and evaluated patient. Paramedics determined child fine and mom decided to take child home. Called mom for follow up a few hours later and child doing fine per mom.

He woke up the next morning, 6/5/21, complaining that his chest hurt (with a stinging. constant pain), his heart was beating  rapidly, 102.5 degree fever, and he said it was hard to breathe. I gave him 200mg  Ibuprofen and he rested. Symptoms resolved in about 2-3 hours and did not return. I contacted the advice line at, and they set up a video appointment for mid afternoon on that same day, Saturday 6/5. By the time of the visit, symptoms were completely gone. PA recommended he have a Covid test as it was possible those symptoms were from having Covid ( coincidentally and simultaneously). The test was negative.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

                                                Patient passed out immediately following administration of the vaccine to the left deltoid. His head fell backwards and limp. The Rph administering the vaccine moved in front of the patient and gently moved his head into an upright position. The patient had mild muscle spasms and twitches while passed out but when he regained consciousness he immediately began talking saying he was ok. Father came into the consultation room at that point and Rph explained what had occurred. Patient looked a little pale and eyes were having a hard time staying open so with the help of his dad Rph helped him down to the ground in the corner of the room so he could have back and head support from the wall. Patient was given a glucose tablet and water, and later orange juice. Patient stayed in the consultation room for about 20 minutes before leaving on his own and saying he was feeling much almost back to normal.

I heard a mom scream while I was giving another patient a vaccine. I ran out with an epipen but he was awake, alert, and breathing normally. I asked what happened and she said he fainted for a second and seized or twitched a little. I did not give him any epinephrine because he was not having any issues breathing and was able to tell me he felt fine. We did call 911 per moms request and they came and checked him out.

He fell backward against a closed door and slid down.  He quickly regained consciousness and his vitals were stable.  within 10 minutes he was no longer dizzy or hot.  He was able to sit up right without issues.   Per dad, this is the same reaction he had to the flu vaccine in fall of 2020.

Mother mentioned that he has been complaining of intermittent midsternal chest pain that worsened after eating since the day prior to admission. She had been giving him peptobismol, thinking it was gas related pain. However, due to him persistently complaining of the pain after eating, she brought him to. She denied any fever, shortness of breath, weakness/fatigue. Of note, mother had COVID in march 2020 and she believed he might have been sick around that time as well.  Patient is still in the hospital and continues to receive pain medication and treatment for myocarditis  (NSAIDS and opioids)

                                                Client received his 1st Pfizer vaccination (Lot# EW0187, EXP 08/31/21) in his left arm at 19:15 from RN.  Client?s parents and sister were with him.  Client?s parents only spoke Spanish and an interpreter was present.  After receiving his shot, client sat in a chair next to his sister while RN administered a shot to her.  Five minutes later client stated he felt nauseous.  RN immediately called out to Vaccine Runner RN and Check-in Nurse who were in the hallway to get an EMT.  Check-in Nurse radioed for an EMT to come to station 3 while Vaccine Runner RN rushed to the EMT room to ensure an EMT got the call.  Check-in Nurse stayed with the client and placed a trash can next to him in case he vomited.  RN stated the client looked pale and clammy.  At 19:26 EMT1 arrived at station 3 and collected the client?s medical history.  Interpreter was also translating the EMT?s questions and statements to the client?s parents.  Client stated he had no known allergies, no underlying conditions, and is not currently taking any medications.  Client also stated he was not experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, or having trouble breathing.  EMT2 arrived at station 3 at 19:27 and brought the client a vomit bag.  The client had not vomited, but still felt nauseous.  EMT1 gave the client a bottle of water and juice,  and took client?s vitals at 19:28 (HR:  64, BP:  120/70).  Client stated he felt a lot better.  While walking out of station 5 Lead RN saw individuals grouped together at station 3 with the EMT and arrived at station 3 at 19:28. Lead RN was updated on client?s status.  Lead RN observed that the client was mildly pale and clammy and asked client?s mother if his current coloring was normal for the client.  Interpreter translated to both parents and client?s mother stated that the client did look a little pale.  Client stated he felt better and was just nervous about getting the shot.  At 19:30 Lead RN asked client to try and stand up. Once client was standing, Lead RN asked client if he felt dizzy and client stated no.  Client stated he felt just fine.  Lead RN and EMT?s directed the client to the observation room to sit in a zero-gravity chair for additional monitoring of 30 minutes.  EMTs walked the client and his family to the observation room and sat him in the zero-gravity chair.  Client stated he felt much better and at 19:47 EMT1 took client?s vitals (HR:  66, BP:  100/70, SpO2:  98).  EMT1 stated client?s color was returning.  EMT1 took client?s vitals again at 20:04 (HR:  67, BP:  104/78, SpO2:  99).  Lead RN arrived in observation room at 20:10 with Lead Ancillary to check on client who stood up and stated he felt good.  Lead RN observed that client was no longer pale or clammy.  Lead RN educated parents and client on potential side effects vs adverse effects of the vaccine.  Lead RN further instructed client and parents to see the client?s HCP or visit urgent care if client started to experience additional common side effects for more than 24-48 hours and to call 911 if the client began to experience trouble breathing, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  Lead Ancillary translated all the information to the client in Spanish.  Lead RN observed the client leaving with his family at 20:15. Client left walking with a steady gate.

A few minutes later in the waiting area he started feeling ill and his mom had him sit down and she called 911.  He complained of weakness, diminished sight and hearing and lightheadedness.  He was very pale and sweaty.  With his mom&#39;s permission I activated an ammonia inhalant near his nose.  He said he felt better after the 2nd sniff.  After a couple minutes he said his symptoms were greatly diminished and he was ok.  The paramedics arrived and pt was able to walk to the ambulance for further evaluation.  A paramedic came back and said the patient is feeling much better and declined to go to the hospital.  I talked to the mom a couple hours later and she said he is all better.

About 58 hours after the first dose, he started having trouble breathing. He called me in a panic and asked me to come home because he couldn&#39;t breathe. It took me ~15 minutes, and by the time I arrived, he was having some trouble breathing so we took him to the emergency room. They did some tests and sent him home. By that point, the symptoms seemed to have resolved on their own. But then he had some labored breathing later that night.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

It was reported that 24 hours after the vaccine on 13May2021 at 17:00, while seate, suddenly both hands started shaking followed by heart rate increasing, reaching higher than 166 bpm. Breathing started to get rapid to a point of hyperventilation on 13May2021 at 18:00. Hands and stomach muscles cramped up as the heart continued to race on 13May2021 at 18:00. Called 911 and they were able to decrease the hyperventilation through slowed box breathing. They stayed for about 30 minutes as the heat rate slowly decreased to just over 100 bmp on 13May2021. Two other incidents of increased heat rate have happened since in May2021. Events were resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events included hydroxyzine prescribed to induce calming effect as. The outcome of events heart rate increasing, hyperventilation and breathing started to get rapid was recovering; outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after the administration of the shot, my son began shaking uncontrollably. He also described visual and tactile disturbances - a sort of hyper awareness as if a precursor to hallucinations - and a racing mind. The shaking and visual and tactile sensations resolved after roughly two hours. He then developed a fever of 100.8, that lasted another 4-5 hours. His symptoms resolved completely within about 14 hours of onset.

                                                The morning after the second dose of the vaccine he woke up and felt hot and my head hurt. He had woken up feeling similar a few times during the night. When he got up he felt really queasy and threw up.  He felt really warm and continued to throw up. With Tylenol the fever was 104 degrees and it continued for several hours even after two doses of Tylenol. I was told to give Benadryl and Ibuprofen. The fever returned to 102 degrees and four later the fever broke. It was almost 10 hours where he was throwing up and the fever fluctuated between 102-104. It is very unusual for him to have any fever.  We continued the Benadryl and Ibuprofen the following day because he still had a low grade fever and some dizziness followed by diarrhea. The dizziness and Diarrhea occurred again the next day three after the vaccine.  It has been five days and he feels better but his stomach is still a little sensitive.  It is possible that he had Covid-19 last year.

                                                Within 5 minutes of vaccination he was in the waiting room and became very dizzy, sweating  and was having trouble breathing.  I reported to the closest worker and she called in another person, assuming one was a nurse and one was not.  She had him look into her eyes, which was difficult, then she had him out his head between his knees for a minute and he was then able to come out of it.  Still a bit dizzy, they moved him to a room with a bed where he could lie down and they put a cold, wet paper towel in his forehead.  He rested there for an additional 10 minutes.  They had him get up and walk before they allowed him to leave.  He had not eaten anything since the night before and he has severe ?needle anxiety ? which both could have contributed to the reaction.  He has not had any issues since, except for a sore arm.

Pharmacist and patients mom got patient down on the ground flat with legs elevated on chair, a cold pack and water.  Pharmacist did not witness loss of conscientious.  Patient was nervous about getting vaccine.  We called 911, emergency services came, did a work up.  It appeared to be a vagal response, possibly from fear of needles.  When emergency services got patient up he seemed a little nauseous.  They took him to hospital.

The pain was described as a pressure sensation in the center of the chest and in bilateral arms.  Upon initial evaluation, he was found to have an abnormal EKG with ST segment changes.  Troponin was significantly elevated.  He was transferred to the hospital.  A transthoracic echo was obtained and was normal.  He was hospitalized on the pediatric cardiology service, admitted on 6/8/2021.  Troponin trended down during his stay. He was started on lisinopril.  He was discharged home on 6/9/2021 with plan for outpatient pediatric cardiology follow up.  Given the proximity of his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to onset of his symptoms, and given similar reported events, the chief concern is whether his episode of myocarditis is related to administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  I was on call as attending physician when this patient was admitted.  Physician cared for this patient as the pediatric cardiology inpatient attending during his hospital course.

It hurt when he inhaled, and he didn&#39;t compete.  He has never experienced this kind of chest pain before.  We thought it was an allergic reaction (hayfever?) because it seemed harder to breathe, so we gave him a benadryl and later went home.  He was tired and took a long nap.  Later he felt better.  But it was scary.  I think he underreported how he felt, to not alarm us parents.  He admits this now. There&#39;s not logical cause other than the vaccine ( no new foods, medications, experiences).  However, he didn&#39;t have any other notable side effects from the 1st or 2nd dose, except tiredness and arm soreness the first days.

                                                At approximately 6 PM on 05/23/2021, family was sitting down for dinner when all of a sudden she noticed that he was turning his head to the left and appeared to be falling out of his chair.  Mom states that eyes were darting back and forth at this time.  He was not responding to her shouting his name and his left arm was curled in towards his body with the rest of his body remaining stiff.  This lasted approximately 1 minute, followed by a time of confusion and drowsiness.  Approximately 1 minute later mom states that patient&#39;s eyes rolled back to his head and he had full body movement consistent with tonic-clonic seizures.  Family were able to lay him onto the ground during this time.  Mom denies any color change, apnea, or loss of bowel or bladder.

No new ingestions.  Has not been sick recently and denies any new sick contacts.  There has been no head trauma.   Per Mom, patient&#39;s dad has a history of &#34;partial seizures&#34; but never required any medication for them.   At arrival to the ED he continued to be drowsy and not at his normal baseline.  Continue to hold his left wrist up toward his body in a contracted manner and tended to have repetitive speech.   Briefly, ER course significant for a CT head and evaluation by pediatric neurology.  CT head was unremarkable for acute intracranial process.  A CBC, CMP, and coags were also obtained due to patient&#39;s continued contracture positioning and the possibility of a stroke.

A male patient of an unspecified age received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 04Apr2001 15:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as 1st dose, single, dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 04Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0171) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history were none. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. No other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Patient stated &#34;The tips of my fingers will suddenly feel like I&#39;m touching a low-voltage battery receiving an electric shock, which then turns to pins and needles, which then turns into numbness in my hands and arms, and sometimes face. Sometimes continued numbness accompanied by light sensations of electrical shock. This lasts from 20mins-4&#43; hours, and happens at least once almost every day since receiving 1st dose (3 weeks past 2nd dose now) I have noticed recently that my heart-rate often goes up before the &#39;&#39;electrical&#39;&#39; feeling onset.&#34; Adverse event start date was on 05Apr2021, 06:00 AM. Events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, disability or permanent damage. Treatment received as blood test, physical examination, blood pressure. Outcome was not recovered.  No follow up attempts are needed. No further information expected.

His BP was checked 4 minutes after the event and read 92/60 with a pulse of 74.  He denied feeling lightheaded.  He sat in the lobby with father by side and health department nurses monitoring him for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes pt gets up out of chair without difficulty and ambulates around the lobby with steady gait and denies lightheadedness, nausea/vomiting or shortness of breath.  Leaves accompanied by father.  Encouraged to push fluid, stay out of the heat today and to take it easy the rest of the day.

At 1:00am on 6/8/21 he was struggling to breathe due to pain in the center of his chest upon inhalation. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before. His chest pain was worse lying down and he could not lie down or sleep and wanted to stay standing on his feet. He felt pain in both forearms too. He was crying from the pain and the difficulty of breathing, and was very tired but unable to recline in order to sleep. I called the advice nurse, who checked with the doctor on call at his pediatrician?s office, and she told us to go to the ER due to concern it may be myocarditis or pericarditis.

                                                Pt was a little nervous before receiving the vaccine, but did fine. He was sitting with his brother for the 15 minute wait period when his brother called for help. I told my staff to call 911. Pt had his head back and his legs outstretched in front of him. He was unresponsive at first and pale. Then he sat upright and said he thought he had just hallucinated. He was distraught and did not understand what had just happened to him. I asked the brother if an adult was with them. He called for his mom and she suggested we lay patient down on the floor. She sat with him until EMS arrived. A paramedic took his blood pressure and EKG. He drank some soda and was able to sit up, his color returned, and he was able to stand.

After feeling his head, he felt very warm with a temperature of 102.3 using both a digital and under the tongue thermometers.   I had child to take a Tylenol pill with something to drink.   At approximately 4:45am took the child&#39;s temperature again and it was 99.6 degrees and I had the child to take another Tylenol pill at that time, so that the temperature wouldn&#39;t spike up.  Around 9:30am, after allowing him to sleep, he woke up and stated that he felt better.  Then, I was able to go to work.

                                                PT had his first dose of Pfizer vaccine at 5pm on 21st. He looked low energy at night. We felt his forehead and he was warmer than usual. However, thermometer did not show he had a fever. He looked much better in the morning on 22nd. We thought that was it.  Only after a week did PT tell us he had more reaction. However, because he was well then, we did not pay too much attention. When we learned of the link between Covid 19 vaccine and Myocarditis, we asked him in detail again. Here are his responses.  He started feeling his throat hurt when he had dinner that around 7pm. It lasted only that night.  He started feeling chest pain around dinner time too. It only hurt when he moved. That chest pain lasted longer and disappeared on the 23rd.  He started feeling there were air bubbles under his skin on the flat part of his left shoulder (above the injection site and below his neck) on the 22nd. He did not see them. He just felt them. When he pressed them with fingers, he felt them popping. This feeling lasted for a total of three days. He could feel the amount of air bubbles become less over the three days.   We have not seen any side effect in the news like his. We are not sure that he should get his second dose. Please someone could advise us, please send us an email. Much appreciated.

                                                Patient felt like he was having an asthma attack on the night of the 21st when playing outside with friends (running and climbing). He has never had asthma, but said his chest was tight and it was hard to breathe. He said when he stopped and sat for a while it seemed to get better. He went to sleep at about 2am and woke me up at 5:20am crying. His chest hurt really bad and the pain was traveling down his arm. When we took his blood pressure at home it was 205/125 and his heart rate was 112. We went to the emergency room at hospital immediately. Once there they did an EKG. The doctor said there was not reason to be alarmed, but the EKG showed signs of possible pericarditis. They then took blood work, a urine sample, an xray and did an echocardiogram. The doctor told us that the blood work did not show any signs of an actual heart attack or any damage done to the heart. She said the echocardiogram showed some fluid build up in the pericardia sac surrounding his heart. She said this is considered pericardia. She mentioned that some young men are having this happen after being vaccinated. She said we seem to have caught it early. They gave him Tordal through his IV when we were there and that took his pain away. We were told to follow up with a cardiologist within 24-48 hours. We have an appointment at Hospital tomorrow at 10:45am.
