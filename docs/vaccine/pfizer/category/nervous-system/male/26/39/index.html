                                                Patient presented with puffy eyes approximately 4 minutes after vaccination. Was alert and oriented to time, person, and place upon questioning and was able to engage in conversation. Parent (mother) of patient was present who gave patient&#39;s medical history and reported allergy to grass with similar reaction.  Blood pressure was taken and found to be 150/80. Mother reported patient had not taken his blood pressure medicine yet that day but his normal is 115/70 with  medication. While nurse was assessing patient&#39;s pulse (patient&#39;s pulse was WNL at 85) and other nursing staff was obtaining medication to administer if needed after assessment, patient became unresponsive to verbal commands and his upper body became limp. At 1054, a one time, single dose of 50 mg of diphenhydramine IM was given in the left deltoid. On site EMT arrived on the scene at 1055, completed assessment, and confirmed giving diphenhydramine was the best course of action. At this time, 1055, patient became responsive to verbal commands and was oriented to time, place, and person. At 1056 O2 sat was at 97%, pulse 70, and at 1100, BP was 110/70. Patient stayed for observation 30 more minutes and remained stable. Patient and parent were educated on side effects of diphenhydramine, to watch for any returning symptoms of allergic reaction throughout the day, and if/when to head to the ER. Recommended patient not receive 2nd dose of COVID vaccination.

Before bed time, had cold sweats and shakes. 1/29 - woke up feeling perfectly fine.  2/17 - Second dose of vaccine. Arm felt sore and was sore two days after. From 2/18-2/20, I noticed the effects of the Cymbalta were gradually decreasing and was experiencing side effects (shocks from toe to head every step). Turns out that even with taking my regular dose of the Cymbalta, my body after 2 hours feels like I had never taken it.   2/20 - After experiencing heavy shocks, shaking, and heart racing, I went home after coming into work 3 hours later.  2/21 - Woke up today feeling dizzy, fatigued, and weak. I know that operating a motor vehicle will not be possible for me.

                                                I took notes during my wait time: -6 minutes in my throat felt weird, but different than normal allergic reactions to foods. I prepared my Epi-Pen so I have easier access at this time. -9 minutes in the sides of my tongue were slightly itchy. -11 minutes in and I felt as though the saliva in the back of my throat was thicker and I needed to clear my throat a bit more often, similar to allergic reactions. -15 minutes in, I felt my heart pound once out of beat, but my heart rhythm returned to normal immediately. Tongue itchiness also became intermittent rather than constant. -18 minutes in, overall condition improved and I felt better. -22 minutes in, my throat felt scratchy like I would if I consumed legumes (chickpeas, green peas, soy beans, etc.) but also oddly warm, which was out of the norm.  No treatments needed given mild reactions. I went to work, but notified my co-workers of my reaction, so if my condition worsens they can help administer my Epi-Pen. I am reporting this at 9:21 am on 03/05/2021, roughly an hour after my first dose.

A 26-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot/Batch number: Unknown) on 04Feb2021 via an unspecified route of administration in the arm at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 Immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter stated her son received 6 times the amount of the vaccine dosage. The patient had not administered pfizer vaccine on same date and not had prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient had no AE&#39;s prior vaccinations. The patient had no any illness at time of vaccination and was not diagnosed with allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity. The patient experienced her son received 6 times the amount of the vaccine dosage/overdosed 6 times the normal amount/overdosed him on the amount by 6 times, a huge mistake on 04Feb2021 and arm very sore on an unspecified date. The patient was concerned about side effects. The patient has been feeling fine and has not mentioned any issues since the overdose. The patient had no relevant test and no had any illness. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

He could not control his body or limbs to move or stop the shaking.  He did not have a fever at the time and could not determine whether or not he felt cold. The uncontrollable shaking was consistent for about ten minutes and then continued sporadically for an hour or so, though it became much more controllable. Hours later, he has more typical symptoms like a bad headache and a fever. The shaking has not come back.

                                                On 2/13/2021, I began to experience both enhanced and new musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms that have not completely resolved still, today, 3/16/2021. While I had experienced some slight discomfort and pain of the b/l thumbs 2-3 weeks prior to 2/13, I began to experience increased pain up to the forearm in both arms on that day. In addition to pain, I had large muscular knots in the superior forearms, especially the right arm. The lower right arm felt extremely tight, and I was having difficulty raising the arm and gripping things. This continued for 2-3 weeks on the right arm. During that time, symptoms worsened on the left arm, while improving on the right arm. A week after the initial symptoms my left arm became worse, and I was struggling to lift objects as light as a sheet of paper. I was also having trouble typing at work, dialing the phone, and opening or closing my hand. Just over a week after symptoms began, I left work to determine a cause and solution for my issues. I also began to have tremors, extreme muscle spasms, and involuntary movements around this time for about 2-3 weeks. While the neurological symptoms have mostly subsided, still, today, 3/16/2021, I continue to deal with various inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms affecting mostly my left arm, but also my right arm. Since yesterday, my left shoulder has begun to have pain as well, making raising my arm and reaching to the opposite side difficult due to pain. I have also had persistent popping of various joints in both arms since the initial symptoms began.

He hit his head and turned face down, he then began to start seizing. During this time we held his head, to ensure he did not continue to hit the floor. A team was called, and the team attended to the patient. Patient&#39;s vitals were taking and he was stable. To take precaution, he was placed on oxygen to ensure he was comfortable during transfer. When picking the patient off the floor with the staff, patient began seizing once more before being transferred to the ED.

He denied any other symptoms. Vital signs: BP=116/78; Pulse=91. He was noted to be clammy. He was evaluated by the Nurse as well as the EMT Personnel on site, and declined for 911 to be called. He made arrangements for someone to give him a ride back home, and was instructed to call 911 if the nausea did not resolve. He voiced understanding and waited in his car until he was picked up.

                                                This was my second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. I took some notes during my waiting time following my injection similar to my first dose. Information from my last report can be found using Temporary VAERS E-Report No: 334845. Of note, I did prepare for my second dose by taking Benadryl 50 mg and Airborne Immune-Boost supplements the night before my second dose, so my symptoms were not as severe as last time.  6 minutes: Mild tingling around tongue. This time all around the edges of my tongue, but a lot less bothersome than the first dose. 8 minutes: Weird. Slight itchiness under left half of tongue. Still very mild but less concerning than first dose itchiness on the left and right sides of my tongue. 18 minutes: Itchy on right side slightly, only side noticeable. 20 minutes: Mild warm feeling on left side of top of my throat. Less bothersome than time. 26 minutes: Left throat warm ness resolved, but transitioned to right side of top of my throat. 31 minute: Throat warmness overall resolved, but slightly itchy on edge of right side of my tongue. 37 minutes: Top of throat on right feels weird but not itchy. Warm maybe? 39 minutes: Weird feeling on right side of throat resolved.  Symptoms more or less resolved the rest of the day, especially after second dose of Flonase @ 9:00 am.  14 hours later: About to go to bed. Feeling fatigued, similar to my first dose after working out. Took airborne and two Benadryl (25 mg each) before sleeping.  24 hours later: 03/27/2021, feeling more fatigued, groggy, mild headache (mostly at back of my head), and muscle aches around my body.  25 hours later: Groggy feeling and fatigue resolved. Possibly due to Benadryl or vaccine?  32 hours later: Majority of muscle aches resolved. Headache also resolved. Feeling mostly soreness at this point.  Drank Airborne @ 10:00 am and 4:00 pm. In between drank plenty of fluids (water, cranberry juice, apple juice, milk). No fever or chills.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving vaccination, patient started experiencing cold sweats and he felt like we was about to pass out. I took him into the clinic room and allowed him to lay down and began to fan him down for him to cool off. After 1-2 minutes, we put him on his back and elevated his feet. While he was laying down, I checked his blood pressure and it was low. I let him lay down for 5 more minutes and he started to feel much better and was cooled down. I slowly got him up and allowed him to sit and checked his blood pressure again. The blood pressure began to normalize. After 5 more minutes, I told him to get up and slowly walk to another chair in the room. Once he was rested there for about 5 minutes, I checked his blood pressure a 3rd time in the opposite arm and it was normal. He no longer felt the light headed feeling and was cooled off. The patient&#39;s partner then informed me that he has a fear of needles and the last time he received a vaccination about 7 years ago, the same reaction happened.

This was followed by slight muscle spasms on the left side of the face (cheek and eyelid) on 04/05. On 04/06, loss of control of left side of the face started. I cannot blink fully with the left eye, and I cannot contract my left cheek fully. My smile is asymmetric and I cannot fully lift my left eyebrow. The loss of taste on left side of the tongue persists as of today 04/08. I was prescribed prednisone 20mg twice daily by my primary physician, which I started yesterday, 04/07. No alleviation of symptoms so far.

The Pharmacy intern noticed that the color of his skin was like a purple and he was passed out. When she started to approach him he started slowly moving his head and adjusting his eyes. He said he felt really dizzy and we had him lay down. He was very sweaty and was shaking a little bit. I took his blood pressure at 11:53 and it was approximately 124/93. He was responsive but feeling dizzy and warm and I stayed with him until the paramedics arrived at about 11:54

                                                About two or three days after my second Pfizer vaccination I started to feel some immense pain in my right trapezius. I had difficulty moving my neck for several hours. The pain subsided later that day but I still had adverse effects. I had a numbing and tingling feeling that traveled from my right trapezius all the way down to my fingers. That sensation continued for several weeks (3 or so) until I saw my general physician. She conducted some strength tests and noticed that there was some weakness and lack of coordination on my right side. I was instructed to go get and MRI and the results showed 5 lesions in my brain and 1 in my cervical spine (C2-C3). After many other tests including blood tests and a follow up MRI the neurologist that viewed my case informed me that I showed a strong case of demylination and it looked likely that Multiple Sclerosis.   The shot might have caused an immune response which allowed the MS to appear.

                                                A few days after my vaccine i was sitting in a chair and touched my calf and noticed that it was numb. It wasnt pins and needles as if it had fallen asleep. It just had significantly decreased sensitivity. I stood up and walked around to try to fix this but the symptoms persisted for at least 36 hours before subsiding to a much lesser but still present degree of numbness. I went to my doctor and they told me that it was not an emergency aince there was no pain and it caused no weakness. This is localized to the skin on my outer left calf. He said this can be caused by crossing your legs too much but i dont ever do that. 3 weeks later and i still have muted sensations in my left calf. It mostly goes unnoticed until i go to scrub my leg in the shower or something and notice that the scrubber feels significantly different on each leg. The left side feels like &#34;static&#34;.

                                                1st Pfizer shot beginning of April went fine. Only a sore arm. 2nd shot this past Saturday was a different story. I got the shot around 3:30 and felt great until about 7. My arm started getting very sore. It got better a little later in the day.  Next morning I felt pretty fatigued but nothing I haven?t felt before. Sore arm was still there. Pretty manageable. Had to pick up groceries and that was a mistake. Had to take deep breaths and my knees were in a lot of pain as I got out of the car and walked through the store (I injured them years ago and now have Baker&#39;s cysts). Wife brought me home and I had rigors on the ride back.  I got home around 11:45 or so and I put on a blanket. I felt so hot I started to get a little bit delusional and very sad/started getting teary. Took off blanket and couldn?t get off the couch or walk without help. Knees now felt like about to fall apart. Wife takes temp shows 107, makes ice bath, I get in and it goes down to 105 a few minutes later. Temp went down to 103 over the next 15-20 minutes and stayed there. Got out with her help and still couldn?t stand up or walk without help.  Sat upright in bed rest of the day. Fever ranged from 98-103, mostly 101-103. Took a very cold shower later in the day but temp still stayed in the same range. All other symptoms mentions else stayed the same. I also now had no appetite and felt nauseous. Stomach felt rock hard, and I didn?t feel too with it. Finally fell asleep later at night and woke up feeling way better but still awful. Monday and Tuesday I had to take off work I felt so fatigued. Both of those days I had no fever, it went away from Sunday night into Monday. I can walk by myself now and just feel a little fatigued today. I have my appetite back now and am back to work.  I should mention that I took Tylenol which didn?t help. Ibuprofen I took later in the day and that might have helped a little. Took Benadryl later and that helped with sleep.

                                                I am experiencing brain-fog like symptoms. My sensations are dulled, I cannot process what&#39;s going around me the way I used to be able to. For example, I am having trouble holding conversations that require a lot of thinking. I am quick to lose focus, and it is difficult to engage in cognitive activities because of it. It feels like I am &#34;up in the clouds&#34; as if I am experiencing a drunk-like feeling or marijuana high. It is as if I am able to feel all the sensations, but somewhere in the brain, there is a disconnect happening that I am not able to be as sensitive as I used to be. I am dull to the usual pain sensations I would normally feel (e.g. when I scratch a part of my body, or when I am in an uncomfortable position for a longer time). Just overall, my sensations are not as sensitive so everything seems duller. I do not feel like I&#39;m 100% there in my body.  I have not had any adverse side effects to other vaccines I have received in the past. I may have gotten the usual flu-like symptoms but nothing as bizarre as the symptoms I am experiencing currently.

I did not call anyone and have not seen any doctor about it. I thought I was having a seizure, except was conscious.

                                                I have suffered from mild tinnitus from exposure to loud sounds, mostly pronounced in my left ear, for several years now.  About 1 week after my second dose I noticed that my tinnitus (the ringing in my ears) got significantly worse - especially in my left ear.  My perception of dynamic range for sounds was severely limited and loud sounds sounded like static and caused headaches and significant discomfort.  It is now 5/18, my second dose was 4/29 and my tinnitus is still significantly worse than before I got my shot.

Patient was waiting 15 minutes post vaccine and when we went to check on him before closing for lunch, patient reported SOB and difficulty breathing. He stated he was currently a Nurse and requested administration of Epipen. administered 1 dose of EpiPen. Patient requested a second dose of Epipen but did not appear to need another dose and reported tightness lifted off chest but still SOB noted. called 911. administered patient 25 mg Benadryl liquid dose as secondary measure per protocol. Patient consumed 2 bottles of water prior to Ambulance arriving about 25 minutes after calling 911. Patient refused to lie down in supine position. He reported to EMTs that he had allergy to NSAIDs and Zoloft, so updated patient&#39;s PQCF form to reflect since patient originally reported NO to DRUG ALLERGIES. Patient left with EMTs on stretcher but reported SOB improving but still present.

                                                A 26-year-old male with no past medical history presents to the emergency department (ED) with an acute episode of chest pain. He reports initially mild dull substernal chest pain for a day prior to an episode of acute sharp chest pain that radiates to his left neck and left shoulder accompanied by diaphoresis leading him to present to the ED. He had received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine three days prior to presentation and reported myalgia and weakness beginning within 24 hours of vaccination. His blood pressure on arrival was 126/83 mmHg and pulse was 61 bpm. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed diffuse upsloping 2mm STE, no reciprocal changes, and PR elevation in aVR. Troponin-I on admission was 6.03 ng/ml prior to peaking at 21 ng/ml while initial CRP was 56.8 mg/L. Transthoracic echo (TTE) showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55-60% with hypokinesis of the basal lateral wall. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was consistent with myocarditis showing subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the basal inferior wall, no edema on T2 sequences, and a mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with an LVEF of 51%. He was started on colchicine, low dose beta blocker and losartan and improved symptomatically along with resolution of the EKG findings prior to being discharged with plan for close outpatient follow-up and repeat imaging.  In addition, a respiratory viral PCR panel was obtained which was positive for Rhinovirus/Enterovirus on nasal swab. Although it is possible that his presentation was secondary to enteroviral myocarditis, the temporal relationship to the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine suggests the possibility of myocarditis secondary to immunologic response to COVID-19 vaccine itself.

However, I have been noticing that ever since I completed the 2 dose series I have been feeling dizzy randomly. First I thought it was normal but now is been months and I constantly feel dizzy. I check my blood pressure and heart rate thinking it may be due to that but they?re usually within normal ranges and the dizziness episodes just come and go throughout the day.

                                                Was afflicted with Severe poison Ivy on back of left leg from below glute down to mid calf. I had numerous smaller and less severe patches. Before getting the covid shot, I had had poision ivy for about 10 days. On the second day after receiving second shot of pfizer, I had a secondary rash occur that surrounded the poison ivy rash. There was a noticeable difference in that the covid rash appeared to come from within the body rather than the poison ivy rash that looked and felt as a more external rash.   The symptoms aside from additional rash was when I would move around and generated any type of body heat the &#34;covid rash&#34; would begin to severely itch and irritate. Additionally, If I would go for walks, the area on my leg that still had the poison ivy rash along with the covid rash would not only itch but burn. It created the sensation that a lighter was being held to my skin. It was quite painful.  The other small areas that had the mix of poison ivy and covid rash were not as painful when I was moving around/ walking like the bigger afflicted area.

                                                A few hours after getting the 2nd dose, I had the following reactions (I didn&#39;t go to the doctor, I&#39;m just reporting what I experienced): *Slight rash consisting of pen-dot sized raised blisters which only appeared on top of a long-healed tattoo I have *Pain all throughout my right jugular (neck) *Sharp pain behind my right ear *Sleepiness *Dizziness *Muscle aches and muscle cramps  Most of these lasted less than 24 hours, but the tattoo rash was progressively becoming worse, I managed to get it under control on day 4 by applying hydrocortisone directly over the immidiate area. I still see a few bumps, but it seems to be healing. I didn&#39;t do anything differently in my daily routine; nothing changed (ie: same soap, same detergent, no contact with dust or etcetera). The tattoo also contains phosphorus, which might be related to the reaction.  The muscle aches and cramps are still ongoing; which is weird considering how I never get either and my daily activities haven&#39;t changed.

                                                A few hours after my second dose on 1/08/2021, I had some adverse reactions that worried me, including arm numbness, tingling around my mouth and cheeks, a splitting headache/blurry vision, joint and muscle pain and dizziness. I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

                                                Around 7 pm I started feeling really anxious. I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

                                                When patient was in for his 2nd dose, reported that an hour after the first vaccination was given he felt like his heart rate was high. No measurement was ever taken to confirm it was in fact high. He also became flushed. He was wearing a sweatshirt, so when he took that off he was feeling better. This episode lasted for 5 hours. No comorbidities or other heart conditions. We asked if he was possibly dehydrated or had any caffeine that day. I determined to proceed with dose 2 under the request that he came back after 1 hour and 2 hours respectively to get vitals.

Became nauseated and then started quickly oscillating between feeling hot and cold. Sat up in bed and when he did, felt &#39;&#39;everything move to my toes&#39;&#39;. Remained conscious for about 2-3 seconds and then woke up on the floor in a pool of sweat about 5 minutes later (knows the timespan based on looking at his watch when he went to the bathroom and when he woke up). Tried to get up and felt unstable so decided to lay in the floor which he did for about another 10 minutes. During this timeframe, noticed jaw pain and soreness which he attributes to clenching his jaw. At this point, able to struggle into his bed and noted that the oscillation of hot/cold had abated and he was left with a mild headache and fatigue which has slowly improved since that time. At this time, pt reports he feels about 90% of USOH but somewhat &#39;&#39;uneasy&#39;&#39; still. Denies reaction to medication or vaccine in the past other than sulfa abx for which he had skin rashes as a child.

He had seizure activity and fell from the chair to the floor. In the process he hit his head on the table. He had his stocking hat on. The other nurses were there immediately. Talking to him, reassuring the mom, BP, pulse oximeter, ice pack, privacy curtains in place. He was offered food and drink. Other staff removed others from the room. The ambulance was called. And arrived. The ambulance assessed him. Education and instruction were given. They asked him to go to ER. He refused. They advised him to see his Doctor. The ambulance had him sign their needed paperwork. Helped him to his feet, he refused to use their cart provided. He said, I am fine. He was strongly encouraged to follow up with his Doctor. He walked out of the room with ambulance personal and his mom.

                                                Pt. was vaccinated by another pharmacist at our remote clinic at an elementary school at 11:35am 3/11/21. Within less than 3 minutes the patient informed a student  that he did not feel well. He reported: itching, feeling hot, shortness of breath, dizziness, loss of vision, and thirst. The student alerted me and I assessed the pt. He was responsive, but felt &#34;tired&#34;. He was sitting on the floor. I told the student to call 911. I continued talking with the pt. as I was preparing the epinephrine and placing a blood pressure cuff on his arm. He became less responsive and asked me for the epinephrine. I injected him with an EpiPen 0.3mg in his outer left thigh through his pants (at 11:43am). Within approximately 30s-1min the pt. became more responsive. I then took his pulse and BP shortly before EMS arrived (11:52am) . They performed the second blood pressure reading and the pt. was transferred to their care at that point.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

Pt got up and went to waiting area and  was sitting down in chair during the 15 minute observation window. Pt passed out and slumped/fell out of chair on patients left side. I was called out by the person monitoring the waiting area to see pt in fetal position on their left side seizing. The seizing lasted for about 15 seconds and then stopped. PT was motionless for a few more seconds and then came around and said &#34;I&#39;m back&#34;.  The pt was given a bottle of water because he said he was thirsty. In the meantime the paramedics were called and arrived. They checked his BP and Blood Glucose. After several minutes they took the pt out on a gurney for further evaluation, there was a question as to whether or not pt hit his head.

I am unable to think. My speech is completely off. I try to say something, but what I say is not what I was thinking. Don&#39;t you dare say I have something wrong with me, in regards to unable to articulate what I want to say, and what Is actually being said. I understand what is happening to me with this reality. Which is why this vaccine is terroristic. Im going to make it my life endeavored goal to resolve this in legal entities. For that. This is not helping anyone. Causing more pain. And. Allowing the government to lie even more. I hate this Country!

                                                When I woke up on Sunday, April 11th, 2021 at around 9am, I have felt like my muscles have been ripped apart, I was sweating, I had labored breathing, and I could not get up for the day. I slept all day, feeling like I had the flu, and was sleeping until 7pm that day. I called out of work when I woke up because I knew on Monday I would not be able to make it, as I felt like I was very tired, lethargic, and sore. This feeling was throughout every inch of my body. I also went to take a shower that day and I had a hard time breathing in the shower, to the point where I had to sit on the edge of the tub, just to make sure I would not pass out from lack of oxygen. This was the scariest sickness I have ever had in my entire life. I literally thought I was going to die. Monday came around and I felt even worse, my muscles were sore, I felt extremely tired, I could not do anything, and I was in bed all day. Today is Tuesday, and I have felt a little bit better, but I have missed two days of work because of the effects this vaccine has had on my body. I made a virtual appointment with a doctor on the app on phone and met with Doctor who basically told me that the only thing I could do for myself is take Ibuprofen every 8 hours for the pain and swelling that might occur and drink plenty of gatorade. It is Tuesday, April 13th, 2021 at 11:29pm at night and I still feel the same as Monday, very weak, tired, and sore all over my body. I have never had this with a vaccine before, until I got the COVID-19 one. I have taken the Flu Vaccine, Hep A, Tantnius, Chicken Pox and never felt like I was so tired I could not get out of bed from these vaccines.

                                                4/10/2021 experienced some right side facial paralysis upon waking.  Called urgent care who directed me to go to a hospital as soon as possible and asked about all events leading up to this, noting that the vaccine may potentially have this side effect, as written in the medical journal.  Went to the ER, they put me in stroke protocol, did CAT scan, negative results, blood tests (including for Lyme), MRI to look for tumors after the CAT scan was negative, and an echocardiogram as they detected a new heart murmur never present before. MRI showed Bell&#39;s palsey in one facial nerve, all other tests are negative, including for Lyme&#39;s disease, a common cause.  I am still experiencing it, and am on Valtrex (anti viral) and Prednisone, but the symptoms still exist. There is no other change in my life or health, the only thing I&#39;ve done differently is have the vaccine (for which we are grateful).

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 16Apr2021 at 14:30 as SINGLE DOSE (at the age of 27 years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included coarctation of the aorta from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing coarctation of aorta (age: 3 months), only requires bi-annual cardiologist visits, loss of consciousness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, covid-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any concomitant medications. The patient had no know allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed on 16Apr2021 at 14:30. Circulation issues leading to a black out. Within 60 seconds of getting the shot, he began to feel light-headed. Within 30 seconds of that, he knew he needed help, so alerted the emergency medical technicians (EMTs) via car horn/flashers. By the time they arrived (120 seconds from the initial shot), he lost his vision and hearing and was essentially unresponsive. They woke him enough to unlock my car door, at which point they had him lay back to improve his circulation. That ultimately worked and got him back to normal within about 5 minutes. The patient had issues like this before relating to a coarctation of his aorta which he had done at 3 months of age. Over the years, he has &#34;blacked out&#34; like this from weight lifting and other high exertion things. This was the first time it was induced without him overexerting himself, and the onset of the &#34;blackout&#34; was much quicker than what he had experienced from weightlifting. Normally, he could tell 1-3 minutes in advance that he would black out. This time, it was about 30 seconds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lost vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and feel light-headed. EMTs did an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood glucose check. The outcome of lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed was recovered on an unknown date. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Moderate aches experienced on the day following vaccination (5/23) beginning in the morning. Two doses of ibuprofen taken in the morning and afternoon.  Mild pain experienced in left front armpit, nearly on the left pectoral, on the night following vaccination. On the following morning (5/24), moderate swelling was noticed in the left armpit, extending from underneath the armpit down to the upper lat muscles and up along the left pectoral nearly to the nipple up to just below the left collarbone. Mild pain experienced in the left front armpit as well as on the lymph node under the armpit. No inhibition of arm motion or pain when using arm, but some feeling of discomfort and pressure. Tele-med help was sought which did not recommend any course of action. By the afternoon, moderate swelling was noticed on the left arm, on the bicep and tricep down to the elbow. Ibuprofen was taken at ~3pm with no effect. Medical advice was sought at 7pm and it was recommended to head to urgent care, but all providers in the area were closed. By this morning (5/25), the swelling has reduced significantly and localized to the left front armpit. Mild pain remains, now more localized to the lymph node under the left armpit.

                                                After first Pfizer dose, I was just feeling really tired. After the second dose, around that afternoon/evening I started feeling my mouth feeling weird. The next day I saw blisters filled with yellow/whiteish puss in my tongue. I went to the ER later i felt a lump under left shoulder while showering. On 28 MAY 3 AM I suddenly felt my face feeling numb and tingly along with my legs. Mind you I have been in the field emplacing howizters for the past few days in a field exercise. I also jammed my finger on an 80 lb metal bar on 26 MAY and got my finger poked with a hot device that also drained the blood after getting an xray. I called medical ER  at 242 and spoke to Dr.(?) Doctor did not give me his name spelling after I asked for the spelling and he told me that I could always come in to the ER. I told him whether the finger pricking and blooding draining could cause the left facial numbness and legs tingleness. He said no so i am now assuming it is an adverse side effect. I am a smart guy have bachelors in journalism but right now I cannot concentrate and filling out htis form hastily just i case the effects get worse and I have to go to hospital er. Talking to the Dr. (?) was harder than normal and he asked if my breathing was normal, I said i am breathing heavily, which I did not have much control over. He said breathe normally and I will be better from the tingliness. I can write well I am a journalism major but this is hard to write for me . I am also feeling chills and I am also not feeling well. I was able to get this link from my local online meeting and I am glad I can contribute to the research and science in general. I wish the doctor had tested me for possible problems when I had an adverse effect from the first vaccine but the doctor told me to come back if the &#34;viral infection&#34; gets worse after I breathe normal. I did take a PT test and my 2 mile run time increased and it was much harder to run than the 2 mile run. Time went up by at least 3 minutes.

                                                Around 2 weeks after my first dose, I started having heart palpitations. The palpitations were on and off for a week and I didn&#39;t think of it much. A week after the palpitations started it started happening more frequently and I was feeling light headed and I went to ER. I was diagnosed with SVT and put on metoprolol to control my heart rate. 1 week after I was on metoprolol, I took my second dose. I was feeling a little dizzy after my second dose but it improved after like 10 minutes. I started getting very fatigued and difficult to concentrate after my second dose. I  spoke to my doctor and we thought it was because of metoprolol. My cardiologist took me off metoprolol but the fatigue didn&#39;t stop and I started having aches in shoulders, arms, neck and back. The aches and fatigue was more severe in the morning. After a week of being off metoprolol I started waking up with chest pain. One day the pain was severe and I had aches in shoulders, arms, neck and back and my heart rate was around 140 so I went to ER. The doctors put me on carvedilol and my heart rate has been controlled but my body aches and fatigue has been going on. The cardiologist and my PCP aren&#39;t sure if SVT or the medication is causing my body aches and fatigue. The only other thing I could think of was the vaccine so I wanted to send this report.

Later that same day I experienced fatigue and loss of appetite that lasted about 24 hours.

After several hours, I felt weak and tired.  By 7:00 pm, I had a migraine that wouldn?t go away and I had muscle ache in my feet and legs.  On 1/13/21 I felt some numbness in my feet and my legs were throbbing.  By 10:00 pm, both of my feet were completely numb and my legs were throbbing/radiating heat.  It felt as if circulation was cut off from my feet entirely.  On 1/14/21 I went into work where I?m constantly on my feet.  I felt intense muscle weakness in my legs and thighs to point where I could barely stand up.  I immediately went to an urgent care where they started me on an Sodium Chloride 0.9% intravenous IV solution drip.  They ran blood tests and urine tests to rule out any other causes to my symptoms.  All results came back negative.  I was told to rest, hydrate, and recover for the next several days.  If my symptoms did not subside within the next couple days, I was instructed to go to the ER for further examination.

A 28-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), intramuscularly on 31Dec2020 in arm at a single dose to prevent COVID. There were no medical history or no concomitant medications. He confirmed he is the physician and the primary doctor for the patient. The patient is a pharmacist and he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 31Dec2020. The next day (01Jan2021), he woke up with a 5-minute interval of indiscernible burning sensation on his face and upper torso that went away after about 5 minutes. The patient reported being hot for a few seconds after taking the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient came in to contact with some with coronavirus and then the patient tested positive for coronavirus on 17Jan2021 with a PCR test. He had no symptoms since a week after his initial exposure to coronavirus. No adverse reactions but turned up with infection. The outcome of event burning sensation on the face and upper torso was recovered on 01Jan2021, outcome of the other events was unknown.   Reporter assessed seriousness for burning sensation on face and upper torso: Medically significant. Causality between burning sensation on face and upper torso and bnt162b2 was related by Primary Source Reporter per Global Introspection.         Information on the batch number/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information , Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is most likely related to an intercurrent condition which is not related to the suspected drug. Based on the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of other events cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient was unconscious for approximately  1.5-2 minutes.  Our Chief Medical Officer was on site and walking into the room as the patient fell. We immediately placed him on his left side, protected his head, and stayed with him.  We called 911 immediately due to the uncertainty of health issues. Once conscious, the patient explained to us that he experiences such every time he receives a vaccine. He was assessed by the CMO as well as the EMTs that arrived on scene.  His vitals were taken. He was moved into a comfortable position and monitored.  He was alert and orientated x 3.  We requested he have someone pick him up instead of him driving himself home which he did.  This gentleman is also an employee and we were able to see him and verify all was well in the following days. We also recommended he tell all vaccinators that he experiences  LOC post vaccination. When he receives his second dose  we plan to have him lying down and our CMO will be present.  We recommended he follow-up with his PCP.

                                                After about an hour following my second COVID-19 Injection I began feeling warm.  My forehead felt warmer so I figure I may have had a slight fever at that point.  I received a metallic (Note I say metallic but I know it wasn&#39;t actually metal but that&#39;s simply the best way I can describe the taste I experienced) following the injection about 5 minutes after.  My arm remained sore following and still remains sore as of this report.  I experienced a decline in mental acuity following about an hour after injection.  I began to feel lightheaded and exhausted to the point I was experiencing severe disorientation and confusion.  I was having trouble putting sentences together and experienced a ringing sensation in the ears.  I felt like I wasn&#39;t even present anymore.  I couldn&#39;t comprehend things around me and apparently had conversations I don&#39;t even remember having.  Note that at that point I had gotten home but don&#39;t even remember getting home.  I just know that this did not begin to wear off until around 8:45pm  when it was like someone flipped a switch and I suddenly was coherent again.  It was an odd sensation to experience.  The arm remained sore and the metallic taste returned briefly after this experience.  I experienced a similar feeling from the HPV injection years ago, but just like this it was a temporary thing that resulted in no long term issues.  However, I cannot tell you fully what we did the rest of the day until around 845-9 pm.  I also remember becoming partly agitated after the injection like my body just all of a sudden took notice of something and shot into action.  I had received my allergy injections this same day about two hours earlier as well and none of these reactions ever occur with those for me.  I continued to drink liquid as far as I know as there were a few empty bottles of water next to me.  I have no recollection of getting them.  It&#39;s odd.  There&#39;s just this brief moment in time that is just missing from my memory with a few short bits and pieces that are there like a puzzle with some missing pieces.  I feel I became so fatigued I could not function.  My emotions I remember were off and hard to control during this period too.  I felt like I was having some random mood swings.  I feel ok now though aside from the upset stomach occasionally and the fatigue and arm pain (but even the arm pain has partly decreased now).  It all ceased.  I have a number of health issues outside of this but have not experienced this long of a period of almost intermittent amnesia and incoherency following an injection before.  I believe it made me that much more tired or reacted with one of my many conditions or genetic variants that perhaps may have been part of this.  I&#39;m happy to provide anything I can to help with this.  I am greatly appreciative of all the CDC has done to get us this vaccine and continues to do to ensure our safety both before and after injection.  It is commendable.    I did fill out my survey through the V-Safe portal as well and will continue to follow up there should I have any changes.  I have not sought medical care following this event as the coherency and such have seemed to resolve in regards to the vaccine injection.  Only thing left are known side effects at this point besides an occasional increase in numbness and tingling that I already experience in my legs and feet.  My absolute best guess for the cause is my immune system which already has some issues regulating (doesn&#39;t always like to learn everything it should and we are currently searching for an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder currently going on as well in me) on top of allergy shots today.  it was perhaps just a bit too much demand on it all at once.  But it seems to be balancing out again now.

A 28-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, Expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at 15:45 pm (at the age of 28-years-old) on left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. No Known allergies. Allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included linoleic acid (CLA), l-carnitine [levocarnitine] (L-CARNITINE [LEVOCARNITINE]), cocos nucifera oil (MCT OIL [COCOS NUCIFERA OIL]) as dietary supplements. The patient reported that, I noticed mild numbness on my left side the same night I had received the vaccine on 26Jan2021 at 20:00 PM. This has quickly faded over the course of the next day, however a week later (about 2 days prior this submission) I noticed prolonged numbness in my left pinky / sometimes adjacent finger. On occasion (once or twice) I have felt slight pain in my left shoulder and left foot. Pinky finger is currently still numb. I am unsure if I pulled a nerve while exercising or if this is an adverse reaction to the Pfizer Covid vaccine. He will be scheduling a checkup with his PCP to get a diagnosis, but informed me as his manager and I&#39;m hereby reporting it as an adverse event. The event was considered as non-serious. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No treatment was received for the adverse event. The patient was not recovered from the event.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A contactable consumer, the parent, reported that a 28-year-old male patient (son) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot unknown, first dose) solution for injection intramuscular on an unknown date (at the age of 28-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Crohns disease (caller concerned because HUMIRA causes immunosuppression). Concomitant medication included adalimumab (HUMIRA) for Crohns disease. After the first dose, the patient became &#34;deathly sick&#34; with the following: high fever, throwing up, massive migraine. These symptoms occurred approximately 5-7 days post vaccination. The patient went to ER (emergency room) and was given IV fluid for dehydration, no other diagnosis, but was told it could be related to the dose of vaccine. The outcome of the events deathly sick, high fever, throwing up, massive migraine and dehydration was unknown.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Received  the vaccine at 10:;15 am on 4/14/2021 and had fatigue, slight chills, and a sore arm.  By 4/16/2021 I felt normal until approx. 10pm when my right ear blocked up and I lost hearing in my right ear.  On 4/17/2021 I treated it as a congestion issue with neti pot and decongestions but the ear remained blocked.  After sleeping for approx 1 hour on 4/17/2021 I woke up at approx. 11pm with severe vertigo and nausea and vomited consistently for approx 1 hour.  I could not get off of the floor and the right side of my face was fixated to the floor.  Paramedics were called and I was taken to the ER where I was treated with anti-nausea medications and valium to reduce vertigo.  A non contrast CT, blood panel, and stroke assessment were all normal with no sign of ear infection.  I was release from the hospital at 10am on 4/19/2021.    On 4/21/2021 I saw an ENT who performed a hearing exam revealing my right ear is completely deaf with normal left ear function.  The ENT prescribed prednisone 10mg (63 tablets over 10 days).   As of today (4/25/2021) I no longer have vertigo and nausea, but I still have no hearing in my right ear and have significant vestibular challenges and cannot walk safely unassisted without getting dizzy.

He cut his face.-Severe, Systemic: Seizure-Medium, Systemic: Shakiness-Medium, Additional Details: Pt told me he gets lightheaded after vaccines. I told him I&#39;d help him get to a chair near vaccination area so I could monitor him. He agreed. I didn&#39;t even have time to apply the bandage when he started twiching &amp; basically jumped out of his chair. He twisted 180 degrees and fell on his face. He got cut in at least 2 facial areas. Pharmacist cleaned him up. He never lost consciousness. EMS came and treated him. He refused to go to hospital at first, but eventually they took him.

Had a headache one day prior to admission that resolved with tylenol. Reports that he has hx HTN but home BPs (which he takes infrequently) have been 140s-150s systolic in the past. Has never been on meds for blood pressure. Chest pain was substernal 5/10 lasted 2 hours and believes it relieved with his blood pressure coming down. Does not describe any other alleviating factors. It was nonradiating, just happens for have left arm pain after vaccine that was present prior to chest pain.

It&#39;s pretty tender when I touch or move my arm abruptly.  From what I&#39;ve researched it seems like a fairly normal reaction, but I still want to report it.  I&#39;ve taken ibuprofen and tried icing it to help with the swelling.

I did not remeasure my temperature, but my head still felt warm. I took 500 mg of acetaminophen 1-3 hours afterwards. The fever went away and I felt normal again by the time I went to bed (11 pm).

One lump is soft and moveable, and one is pea sized and it is firm and also moveable. Both lumps are painless. Discomfort and tension on the side of the neck where the swollen lymph nodes are. I noticed the lumps about two weeks after the first vaccine dose. The day after the second dose, the lumps swelled a bit more and neck tension increased.

                                                Aside from the expected soreness in the arm and short lived fevers, I started to develop painful swelling and hard lumps in my lymph of the same armpit as my injection site. It was quite painful and broke out into a puss-tipped rash and continued to get worse. It has been over 20 days now and instead of getting better, it has spread to my other armpit now. I went to the local advanced urgent care clinic who ran some bloodwork and said my white cell count is normal and non-indicative of lymphoma, so I was put on prednisone and doxycycline. The medication has done next to nothing and I was told that there was nothing else they could do. The pain in the arm varies per day but there are some days where it is too painful to use my arms at all.

                                                Last weekend on Sunday morning (April 25th), I received my second shot of Pfizer vaccine at 9am.  My body started to show some side effects on the evening of Sunday. I felt super cold around 10 pm and at the same time, I had a fever, too. I went to bed early that night (around 10:30 pm) and since I was super cold, I had 3-4 blankets on me when I was on my bed. Suddenly, at 1 am, I woke up due to a very strange noise in my head (a very low-volume noise of knocking on the door every 10 seconds!! I think it was only something in my mind). Since I couldn&#39;t sleep because of that low artificial noise, I decided to go to the bathroom at around 1:10 am (My bode was also in lots of pain at that time). When I started to walk, I realized that something is wrong with my body. When I peed and stood up to get back to my bed, I noticed that I&#39;m losing control! Therefore, I hit the bathroom door to wake up my girlfriend, and then I fainted! (I can&#39;t remember anything for about 30 seconds here). My girlfriend told me that when I fainted, one of my eyeballs was upward and the other was downward (like zombies!!). She started to freak out and called her mom, but once they started talking, I woke up. My body was soaking wet when I woke up and I was in lots of pain. I asked her to help me to lay down on the ground. After 10 minutes, that my sweats were gone, I started feeling cold and asked her to give me a blanket. I couldn&#39;t sleep for about 2-3 hours after I fainted, but I was feeling better (I was much better than the time before fainting). On Monday afternoon, I called the health center and told them my side effects. They strongly recommended visiting ER ASAP since the symptoms that I described were severe side effects of Pfizer. Therefore, I went to ER on Monday (April 26th) to see what?s the issue. Hopefully, after spending 3-4 hours there, and passing some tests, the results did not show anything wrong with my body, but just the side effects of the vaccine.

                                                Immediately after the patient received the vaccination he stated that his arm felt numb. This seemed to concern him greatly although I reassured him that this reaction had been reported to me on other occasions and it was transient. I checked his blood pressure and pulse, both of which were normal, and he waited for about 20 minutes before returning to work where he received the shot. He returned to the pharmacy approximately 15 minutes later and stated that he felt dizzy, nauseous, and had blurry vision. His forehead felt cold and clammy to the touch and he was sweating. I had him sit, and checked his pulse again (still normal). He stated that his chest felt &#34;cold and tired&#34; but he was not having difficulty breathing. After observing him for some minutes I gave him a 50mg dose of Benadryl in case the reaction was allergic in nature. I observed him for at least 15 more minutes were he seemed calm and was able to speak on his cellphone to family so they could come and pick him up. In my opinion he seemed improved by the time he left but I counseled him to seek medical attention if his adverse feeling worsened. The patient was able to walk out of the Walmart without assistance. I called him at home around 5:20 pm and he sounded very sleepy but he had not yet had to seek further medical attention.

                                                Cognitive -- severe symptoms began ~3 days after Pfizer 2nd dose.  Extreme disorientation and confusion (transient), memory loss (longterm), extreme lethargy - unable to move, intermittant psychosis (mild, esp. when going to sleep), and anxiety (transient but very extreme, unlike anything I&#39;ve felt before, not improved by diazepam)  (continued for 10 days then began to improve dramatically followed by alternating relapse on a daily basis for 4 weeks, up to present -- dramatically and stably improved by steroid treatment, returned after discontinuing)   Nerve pain --  began ~1 week after Pfizer second dose. -- tingling, burning throughout extremities, especially fingertips, toes, hips; transient (usually 5 seconds or less). Progressively became more frequent (20&#43; / day), longer lasting (up to 20 seconds) and more severe (like stabbing or electric shock). Gradually resolved after course of dexamethasone beginning 3 weeks after vaccination.   Sharp inner ear pain -- (both ears) began ~1 week after Pfizer second dose. Rare events (~5x / day), very transient (1-2 seconds) but extremely painful. Continues up to present,  (4 weeks after Pfizer second dose). Also constant popping of both ears beginning week 2 to present, feels like fluid inside.   Adenopathy -- On 4/28/21 noticed massive swelling on left pectoral muscle (contralateral to vaccine injection site), diagnosed as lymphadenopathy, moderately painful. Continued to get worse for 1 week, began dexamethasone on 5/7/21. Dramatically improved, however swelling returned after discontinuing steroid and spread to all lymph nodes, including neck and others. Became extremely painful on 5/14/21, unable to walk due to swelling in inguinal lymph nodes.  Again dramatically improved after steroid injection on 5/16/21.

                                                Patient reports approximately 1 week after vaccination noticing tingling sensation to right upper lip. This was mild and persisted for a few days. He noticed a few days later that when he went to drink water it drippled down his right cheek, as if he could not close his lips completely on the right side. This continued for 1 day, then improved and has now resolved. Never had any other facial paralysis and was able to completely close his right eye. He did not seek medical attention for this. He went for his follow up vaccination dose and was turned away when he brought up these symptoms, and made appointment with myself at his PCP office.

                                                On May 13 (3 Weeks after first covid vaccine shot), I started to feel skin pain on the area above right kneecap. Then I felt nerve pain on the same side of leg.  May 14 I couldn&#39;t sit down as I felt occasional lumbar pain. I even went to orthopedics and they said no trouble found. Skin pain spread through the whole body.  May 15 I had second shot of pfizer, still back pain and thigh pain. Skin pain spread through whole body. May 16 I saw red spots begin to surface on the thigh.  Skin pain spread through whole body. May 17 red spot became bigger I thought it was rash, pain persists.  May 18 the red spots looks out of control, I scheduled the next available appointment for primary care (2days later!)   May 19 Just bigger red spots every time I take off my pants.  May 20 black bubbles appeared in the morning, and I got to finally go to appointment at noon, diagnosed as shingles.

                                                Fever; Headache; sore arm; very tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 28-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EW0150) in the left arm, on 24Apr2021, at 12:15 PM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine.  Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. Prior to vaccination, it was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. On 02May2021, at 06:00 AM, the patient experienced fever, headache, sore arm and he was very tired. No treatment was received. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not recover from the events at time of this report. The case was assessed as non-serious. Then, on 15May2021, at 09:45 AM, the patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY, Lot. EW0179) in the left arm, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                28 year old male presented for initial dose of Phizer-BioNtech at 1100 AM on 6/3/21.  Pre-assessment form was filled out and reviewed with nursing student administering the vaccine. The client stated no known allergies to medications, food, venom, or environmental elements. He also stated no allergic reactions to previous vaccines. The client also stated that he had no known health issues. After administration the patient stated he was dizzy and then immediately became unresponsive, diaphoretic, eyes rolled back, and head hyperextended. Family was present and we asked if he had any seizure history and his family declined. At this time the patient and family informed us that after vaccines in the past he does faint but didn&#39;t inform staff before this vaccine was administered. The patient remained unresponsive for 45 seconds. Then his feet were elevated and he asked to lay down. At 11:11 AM his HR was 60 and O2 was 97% on pulse oximetry. He felt hot and was still diaphoretic and felt very fatigued. Once he started feeling better we sat him back up and his HR was 89 and O2 was 99%. We gave him  2 bottles of water and crackers. He remained in our care for 45 minutes. He then waited an additional 30 minutes in the post vaccine area. His family stated they were going to drive him home and get some food.  The patient is expected to return June 24, 2021 for his second dose of the Phizer vaccine. We provided additional discharge instructions

He was sweating and then proceeded to vomit. We had him sit in the other exam room and gave him some water. After that he started saying his arms were tingling and going numb, when that happened I discussed with him calling EMS and instructed the PCT to call EMS. When EMS came the pt said he was feeling better and signed a refusal to go with them to the ER. The pt had a friend who was in the store with him that was going to drive him home. He was able to sit for about 30  minuets when he stated that he was feeling better and was wanting to go home. PCT walked him to the car. He was instructed that if at any time he started having symptoms again that he needed to go to the ER.

                                                arm sore; got a little warm; got a little headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 28-year-old male patient received first and second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 22Apr2021 (Lot Number: EW0171) and on 14May2021 (Lot Number: EW0182), (at the age of 28-years-old) respectively, both as single doses for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that his second shot was scheduled at the location where he got his first dose, but he could not go to that location, so he rescheduled the second dose at different location. Further he added that, the guy at the second location did not know he was going to get the second shot hence, the patient was afraid if he might get the first shot twice and wanted to know if he should be concerned about this. On an unspecified date in May2021, the patient had arm sore, got a little warm and headache. The patient experienced the same side effects as he did with the first dose and stated that the symptoms started the next day after each dose and lasted about two days (exact dates were unknown). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Additional information is requested.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At around 1:30 in the morning, i became really weak, achey, had the chills, some nausea, a minor headache, a slight sore throat, and  minor eye pain like they were dry. Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

This 29-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EL1283), intramuscular, on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine location was right arm.  Age at vaccination was 29-years-old. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 13Jan2021 at 09:00 PM, the patient experienced numbness to both legs, went to sleep and when he woke up both legs were completely numb. This had never happened to him before, so he assumes it&#39;s attributable to the vaccine. The event was reported as non-serious. No treatment was received for the event. Outcome was not recovered.

                                                I felt soreness and pressure build up in my arm starting a few hours after the receiving the dose. The soreness and pressure got progressively worse over the course of two days. It wasn&#39;t unbearable, just uncomfortable. The second day after the vaccine I had stretched my arm pretty good for minute, when I released the stretch I felt a rush of something for from my arm into my torso. I got really dizzy and passed out, my wife was in the room at the time and said I never closed my eyes; but I had completely blacked out. My wife had woken me up and I wasn&#39;t sure what had happened, it took me about 30 seconds to realize I had passed out after stretching that arm. My arm had felt better after waking up from passing out, and soreness had passed a couple days later. I didn&#39;t get checked out,  after I woke up I started feeling fine.  I&#39;m honestly not sure if it&#39;s directly related to the vaccine or not, I just thought I should let someone know just in case.

It was very mild and came and went for several days. I&#39;m confused because patient stated first shot was in right arm but our records show he received on the left arm. Didn&#39;t report any symptoms. He did nothing for the numbess. He said it was barely noticeable. After a couple days, it went away completely.

                                                On 07May21 at 11:00PM, I experienced an immense pain on both of my arms that I&#39;ve never experienced before in my life. Every time I move my arms, fingers, or apply any amount of pressure on any part of my arms, I will get a surge of pain raining down on my arms and only my arms from the shoulder down. At the same time, I also felt a surge of energy/adrenaline flowing throughout my legs, from the pelvis down, urging me to move around. I tried to force myself to sleep (without medication, just forcefully closing my eyes and trying to sleep) to no avail, so I got up and walked around my room and did some leg squats exercises without moving my arms too much from 11:10PM till 3:10AM, (I think getting my blood pumping throughout my body helped ease the pain a bit). The intensity of the pain on my arms decreased about half at around 3:10AM and I was finally able to fall asleep at around 3:30AM. I woke up once at around 7:45AM to go to the bathroom and drink some water. During this time, I think the intensity of the pain had dropped to 1/3 from when I first experienced this pain. I fell back asleep again and woke up at around 11:20AM. Most of the pain is gone by now, I only felt the lingering stings of the dreadful night from before. I continued to feel this phantom pain on both of my arms throughout the day and it wasn&#39;t until the day afterwards on the morning of 09May21 that relief was finally bestowed upon me.

First Temperature check at roughly 13 hours from vaccine 102. 1000mg Tylenol taken.  Temperature  drops to 100 an hour or so later but jumps back to 102 a few hours later. 4 hours after first Tylenol dose took another 1000mg. Same outcome as before but Temperature spiked to 103.4 at about 26 hours post vaccine. Still very lethargic, no appetite since onset of symptoms. Headache, head feels weird when bending over.  36 hours post vaccine Temp raises to 103.8, another 1000mg Tylenol taken.  Next five hours spent being cold yet sweating.  42 hours post vaccine Temp returns to normal.  Rest of day feeling weak and head feeling odd when making quick movements.

                                                I received the 1st shot of the pfizer covid vaccine on March 11, 2021. Within 2 days I began to feel extremely fatigued. The days following I experienced night sweats, nausea, extreme fatigue, fever. I went to urgent care with a 102 fever, jaundice, and anemia. Urgent care sent me to the ER. At the ER they admitted me to the hospital. I was in the hospital for 3 days with hemolytic anemia. After a lot of testing and ruling out any infections, they discovered I have a rare blood disorder: hereditary elliptocytosis. The pfizer vaccine created an immune response and since I have this blood disorder I was predisposed to this event occurring from the vaccine (hemolytic anemia/juandice) without knowing it. It was a result of the vaccine. I was told to not get the second shot because there is no guidance, but that I am a high risk individual now. I need medical advice from people who are familiar and know.

                                                The first day I got the vaccine, my arm became very sore about 4 hours afterward. It kept getting more sore until I fell asleep. I stretched and massaged it.  The next day (Sunday), I woke up to a small canker sore in the left side of my mouth behind my top lip. It is right by where my canine and lateral incisor intersect. I thought nothing of it since I do occasionally get canker sores. As the day went on, the pain increased. I also noticed that two more sores had appeared. One on my lower lip right below where the original one is, and on my gums near my throat, like right where the gums end and throat begins. All on the left side. I got the shot in the left arm.  They&#39;re all more painful than usual, but the first one is the worst and is the biggest one I&#39;ve ever had. Normally if I get one (like once every other month) the canker sore is small, white, and hurts if I touch it. The one behind my top lip is causing my lip to be noticeably swollen when I open my mouth, and it&#39;s definitely left a crater. I can&#39;t brush my teeth near where it is because it feels like I&#39;m ripping out my flesh.  In addition, a submandibular node feels weird. It&#39;s not quite painful, but it&#39;s definitely a weird sensation that is noticeable at all times. I started feeling it one day after the vaccine, and today (two days after) the feeling is much more pronounced.  I have not seen a doctor since it seems like others have had these side effects, and they went away after a couple days. I just wanted to provide more data since it&#39;s definitely not the most comfortable thing right now.

A 29-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19May2021 (at the age of 29-years-old) at first dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that he had cold symptoms. He thought he had allergies before the shot because he would usually get them about this time of year and it would start to act up. The patient&#39;s arm was also sore and felt that it was something he had before the shot because they were kind of similar and he just felt congested like when gets sick. Additionally, the patient wanted to know how long he has to wait to take medications like Nyquil or Dayquil. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                about 5 minutes after receiving the pfizer vaccine patient became sweaty and skin got clammy and he felt like he was going to faint. He lost all color to his face. Blood pressure was taken and it was 92/60. We gave him a cold pack on the back of his neck and had him lay down and elevate his feet  and legs. Also got him some cold water to drink. He started to feel better in about 15 minutes after that. We continued to monitor blood pressure about every 5 to 10 minutes and it got to 99/72 and last check was 120/65. He did not want the ambulance or to go to urgent care. We told him to take it easy the rest of day and to have somebody with him til next morning. And then he and his friend left to go to his parents house.

                                                Patient got the vaccine around 12:45pm. At around 1 pm, the patient fainted for about 7 seconds and fell out of the chair in the waiting room. I ran outside of the pharmacy to assist him. He was conscious but confused for a few moments. Then said he felt fine. Patient showed no signs of allergic reaction. I asked him if he had any injuries/bleeding and he said no. I asked him to stay at the pharmacy for another 30 minutes so I could observe him closely. We gave him a cup of cool water to sip on. At around 1:10 pm, I went outside the pharmacy to check on him again and he said he felt flushed and asked for a bucket.  At 1:15 pm, he vomited into the bucket. He said he felt 100% better after vomiting. I had him stay at pharmacy until shortly after 1:30 pm when he said he felt okay to go home. I called him at home around pm the same day and he said he felt fine.

He then was standing waiting for his wife to receive her vaccine.  He became dizzy and diaphorectic.  He passed out for a moment.  I kept him in the chair and monitored his breathing and tried to keep him alert and responding  to my questions.

I got him some water and when I returned he was slouched in his chair. His leg and arms started to twitch for at least 10 seconds and he was incoherent. After the twitching stopped, he seemed to not have full recollection of the past minute and asked if he had passed out. His shoulder muscles were tight, he felt very warm, and soon after become nauseous but did not vomit. We gave him an ice pack to cool him down in addition to the cold bottle of water. We waited for a friend to come pick him up and during the wait he recovered and was able to hold a conversation, not feel dizzy, and stand up on his own. After 30 minutes of observation, the friend arrived so I walked with him out of the pharmacy to the car.

The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine because patient was really skeptical about vaccine. The patient confirmed that he had taken both the shots. On an unspecified date, the patient reported that &#34;I think the second time it is like some Arm Pain&#34;.

Starting last night, after sweating an obscene amount, I started feeling dizziness. Not a normal dizziness, but a severe one with brain zaps. The type of brain zaps someone has when coming on or off affexor/venlafaxine (which I?m currently on). The dizziness only happens when I stand and the brain zaps happen more frequently than when the dose changes or is forgotten with the snri. Before someone asks... yes... I?m taking my affexor properly and haven?t changed how I?m taking it since my covid shot.

                                                Low grade fever; Sore mouth; Sore throat; still so weak; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  This 30-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EK5730), via an unspecified routed of administration, on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 30-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS). The patient just wanted to know how long a low grade fever is in the patients, it&#39;s been like three days now she still has low grade fever, mouth sore, sore throat and she is still so weak. The patient was treated with Tylenol. Outcome was not recovered.   The reporting nurse considered the events related to the vaccine because the events started after that.

                                                Friday 1/8/21 I got a bit of what i think was nerve pain or just shooting pain on the wrist of the right-arm that was not the injection arm. Then today (Sat 1/9/21) that nerve pain is gone, but I developed a worse pain (pain of 6-7 out of 10) and additionally some weakness in the left-forearm closer to my elbow than my wrist, possibly where a tendon is (the injection arm). The pain shoots down from the elbow area towards my wrist on the posterior side. I haven?t done any extraneous work or lifted anything heavy since 1-2 days before the vaccine. It?s also my non-dominant arm so I don?t use it as much as my other arm.  So far I have iced it twice and taken Tylenol which has helped the pain. The arm is currently in a sling and I haven?t tried to use it since icing it the first time.

Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable nurse (patient&#39;s wife). A 4-decade-old male patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Herpes Zoster (chicken pox and shingles), and hypogammaglobulinemia from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter asked if her husband should receive his 2nd dose of vaccine after experiencing Bell&#39;s Palsy 12 hours after 1st dose. The patient had history of herpes zoster (chicken pox, shingles) on the same side of his face as the paralysis now (Bells Palsy). The patient was in a lot of pain and asked how serious Bell&#39;s Palsy is. Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information on the lot number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Bell&#39;s palsy cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

He fell from the bench to the floor where he landed on his stomach. When I ran over to him, his eyes were open but his body was limp. I tapped his back and asked if he was ok, and he was startled as if I woke him up from sleep. He was alert and was able to speak, he asked for water and I gave it to him. I asked of he wanted me to call emergency services but he declined. He then vomited in the waiting room trash can. His sister was with him and began to rub his back and fan him. I asked again if he needed to go to the hospital and again her declined. I told them to please wait in the lobby at least another 15 minutes before leaving and he did. I called to patient around 8pm to check on him and he said he was fine and had no more symptoms.

                                                11pm on day of (Sunday) vaccination felt soreness in left arm at injection site and in entire upper arm when trying to hold it up. Soreness subsided by noon the next day, Monday. No symptoms on Tuesday until late evening when tongue began to feel sore. On Wednesday morning around 6am, woke up with severe body fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea, headache. Hands and fingers very cold to the touch. Severe fatigue and weakness all day. Sore tongue persisted. No respiratory symptoms present. By Thursday (today), body is still feverish, joint and muscle aches persist, light headache at times. Still fatigued and weak. All symptoms today Thursday are much weaker except for the muscle and joint pain which remains high.  The reason I am reporting this is that from what I&#39;ve read and been told, the delayed onset of these symptoms (almost 3 days) is very unusual, especially because I had little/no symptoms in the first 2 days of the vaccine.

A 30-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: el1283), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, on 09Jan2021 11:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mild asthma, allergies to fur, mites and olive tree pollen from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) in two weeks included finasteride taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: ek5730) at 30-year-old on 19Dec2020 08:00 PM at left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination. No Covid tested post vaccination. A few hours after the second dose, the patient experienced back and joint pain, shivers and headaches for two days. On 19Jan2021 (reported as 10 days after the second dose), the patient started experiencing tingling sensation (paresthesia) in both legs without loss of sensitivity or strength. Also, the patient started having lumbar pain similar to a mild muscle cramp. The paresthesia was somewhat strong for a week and started to very slowly fade away, but the patient still has intermittent lumbar discomfort and mild tingling sensation in his feet and sometimes legs depending on posture. Possibly a demyelinating neuropathy. No treatment AE. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I went to sit down to be monitored and the next thing I know is I have a pharmacist in my face asking me if I am ok and telling me an ambulance was on the way. No idea what caused it or how severe the seizure was.

                                                At approximately 4:30pm, on the day I got the vaccine, I began to feel the effects of Encephalopathy and Encephalitis, in which I began to feel pressure in my skull, and felt confusional thinking. It became hard to discern my thoughts. I also, began to experience a difficult time with my vision not being able to control what my vision was focusing on, as well as seeing a blue tint in my vision. I am also experiencing mild pressure and aches on the right side of my back and left side of my chest. These effects have been continuous for the last 4 days. To treat these symptoms I have been using natural remedies, and have maintained a stable condition due to that.

                                                I&#39;m really hoping to get some guidance as I seem to be having a very strange reaction to the vaccine. Approximately 2 weeks from my 1st vaccine on 3/16/2021; I had sudden panic attacks. I never had a panic attack or anxiety before. Following the panic attacks, I have been struggling with several major symptoms: no appetite/ loss of appetite, chronic headache(almost daily), GI problems, and most noteworthy, daily inexplicable waves of anxiety and worry.  As mentioned, I have no history of anxiety or panic attacks. I also am experiencing chills, sweating, shaking, and a lot of brain fog/ inability to concentrate. The symptoms did start to subside to some degree, but as of today (4/24/21) I had more sudden and inexplicable rushes of anxiety and panic. Some other symptoms are an elevated resting heart rate and higher than usual blood pressure. I have also been waking from sleep suddenly with a feeling of jitteriness in my chest and palpitations. I have had trouble sleeping and almost feel like a rush of adrenaline hits me right before I start to fall asleep. I received my 2nd vaccine on 4/6/2021 because I didn&#39;t think these could be related to the vaccine. I&#39;m seeing many people online mentioning similar reactions after getting their Pfizer vaccine.

It has been six days since getting the vaccine and still no signs of them disappearing.  Followed the guideline of taking 50mg of diphenhydramine as suggested with minimal success in getting the hives to go down completely.  They will subside slightly sometimes but not at all entirely and are currently still present. There is occasional itchiness which comes and goes as well as  a slight itchy burning sensation in the right hand seemingly random at times.  A small hive also developed on the right hand that does not originate from where the itch on the hand comes from.

Got a fever ranging from 100.1-100.5 for the majority of the day. Fever dropped to 99.8 by 2000 that night. All day I had muscle tightness and stiffness to the point I could not function for work or move with out being in extreme pain.

This continued for two days. - It is now 6 days out, and still experiencing brain fog (days 3-6 so far), which I didn&#39;t really notice until fever began reducing on day 2. The fog has also come with general fatigue, though not as bad as during fever period. Can be difficult to concentrate, focus, and feels associated with slight pressure in ears.

                                                Patient received second dose of Covid19 Pfizer-BioNTech. A few minutes later, my pharmacy technician, was informed that patient had collapsed in front of the pharmacy. I was in the immunization room with another patient. I grabbed an Epinephrine 0.3mg auto injector and went to the patient. He was unconscious and unresponsive. I told him to call 911 and to send for paramedics. I administered one dose of 0.3mg epinephrine and patient woke up within a few seconds. He stayed sitting with me assisting as this was his most comfortable position. He later transferred to a chair and paramedics/emt took over when they arrived.

Began to spread along the arm, but nowhere else on the body and develop blisters and redness. Along with rash was constant pain through the whole arm and pain in armpit where lymph node is located.

The first time I thought it was due to not resting enough and overworking, but there was no possibility of that after the second dose on May 11th. I have been resting as much as possible and trying to alternate heat/ice therapy and seems to be helping, but am worried what I have may be blood clots. I do not have a primary physician at this time but am now looking.

Upon deciding that he had not received any of the vaccine, I administered a second dose bc the hub was split all the way down.   I administered it and left him to go wash my hands.  After about a minute, we heard a loud sound.  When I got to him, he was getting up and was pale. His face was white, hands clammy and sweating.  He did not remember falling.  I took his bp which was 99/65.  My tech went and got him some water.  He started drinking and then vomited.  He said he immediately felt better.  his girlfriend went and got him some juice.  He sat there for about 15 more minutes.  He sated that he felt fine, but he had not had anything to eat or drink that morning.  (also a beer the night before).  He got up and walked out without any help and was going to get him something to eat.  He was hungry.

                                                Developed tenderness and sensitivity under left arm on rib cage / upper torso area approximately 2 weeks after 2nd dose. It was initially suspected to be a rash or allergic reaction, however there was no redness or visible signs of a rash in the area. Approximately 20 days after 2nd vaccine dose, severe migraine headache occurred which lasted for approximately 6 days. After about 3 days of headaches, COVID-19 test was taken and confirmed negative. This was followed by a visit to urgent care facility. Shot of Toradol was given for the headaches and an anti-inflammatory  prescription was provided. Also mentioned to the nurse practitioner the sensitivity at left rib cage / upper torso area. It was confirmed by a nurse practitioner to be early signs of shingles. Prednisone and anti-viral were prescribed for the shingles outbreak. Thankfully the shingles were caught early enough to be treated immediately and I only missed 5 days of work (Mar 24- Mar 30) and the shingles did not develop into large blisters or boils.

                                                After the pt received the vaccine, he asked me for some water because he wasn&#39;t feeling very well. I didn&#39;t have any on hand, so I offered chocolate. When I came back he tried to reach for it, but was struggling. He dropped it and started making jerking movements and slumping over. I put my hand on his chest to keep him propped up and called for my technician. After a minute or so, he was responsive, but sweating and his skin tone became washed out. I told him he should lay on the floor and prop his feet up on the chair. He said that made him feel better. I got him some orange juice to drink after he got off the floor. He remained near the location for 30mins and then did some shopping to make sure he would be okay before leaving with his wife.

These symptoms worsened throughout the day. My pulse felt weak. My breathing became rapid and shallow, even though it was not difficult to draw breath. The major symptoms on 6/7 were headache, with a sense of my motion being affected. My urine throughout this time was excessively dark, even though I was drinking more water than normal. The following day, 6/8, most of my joints began to heart, and I became very stiff; this sx lessened after taking a long, slow walk.  On 6/13 another event involving slowed heart rate, subjectively weak pulse, and shortness of breath ensued. There had been no unusual or excessive physical activity, and as I had not experienced this phenomenon before receiving the second vaccine dose on 6/4, I believe that the 6/13 event was also linked to the vaccination.

                                                About 2 days after the vaccination I began to have chest pain that would not go away unless I leaned forward. It hurt all the time for about 7 days and went away gradually. I believe it to me myocarditis. As well as the above reaction, my migraine frequency went up noticeably from around 10 days a month to 15 or 20. This has not shown any sign of abating and seems to be permanent. Please note that the heart issue went away but the migraine problem definitely has not.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

                                                Started feeling very fatigued around 6/7 PM on 1/7/21. Ate dinner shortly after and took my normal sleeping pills as previously listed. Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

Not full numbness, but felling as if coming out of a novocaine shot. Left side chin, lips, cheek extending up to ear/eye. No sign of swelling, droop, redness. Has lasted 2 weeks &#43; and has improved over time but not fully resolved. Now is more an occasional numb feeling mostly in L cheek/lips/corner of L eye. I grind my teeth during stressful times and grind more on my left side so was thinking it could be related to that. Sought medical attention from my doctor who felt said most likely not Bell&#39;s palsy related.

                                                I was suffering from paralysis and numbness on the left side of my face.  I went to the ER and was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer (the patient). A 31-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6201) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 21Feb2021 11:30 a.m. at age of 31-year-old, at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had history of frequent ear infections. Concomitant medication included fluticasone which was taken within 2 weeks of vaccination for an unspecified indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient reported when he woke up the next day after receiving the vaccine (22Feb2021), he found that he was suffering from paralysis and numbness on the left side of his face. He went to the emergency room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. He had been experiencing some minor pain in his left ear beginning two days before he received the vaccine (i.e., three days before onset of facial paralysis), and this ear pain had continued as he continue to experience the palsy. Since visiting the ER, he had also seen a neurologist. The doctors he had seen do not necessarily think that the palsy resulted from receiving the vaccine. The onset date of the event &#34;I was suffering from paralysis and numbness on the left side of my face. I went to the ER and was diagnosed with bell&#39;s palsy&#34; was reported as 22Feb2021 09:00 a.m. The event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The event was non-serious (the event did not result in death, not life threatening, not caused/prolonged hospitalization, no disabling/Incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect). Oral steroid and antiviral drugs, eye ointment was received to treat the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Monday afternoon 3/22/2021 I received the vaccine. The next day (23rd) I had dizziness and nausea started with stomach grumbling. 24th worsening nausea with some very green loose stools, still dizzy and started feeling fever, chills and then began loss of appetite. By the 25th &amp; 26th my condition had worsened. still had fever and chills, nausea &amp; lost appetite (could not eat anything). I was only drinking fluids by this time and I felt extremely fatigued and spent most of Thursday and Friday in bed recovering. By Friday I contacted my doctor, who said to go to urgent care if I didn&#39;t feel better on the weekend. Saturday my condition was the same and still on Sunday I was not any better.  By Sunday, I took myself to urgent care,  upon arrival, pulse was 124 with a temperature of 100.2F ..  the worst symptoms for me were all body weakness/fatigue &amp; fever/chills &amp; nausea. I was prescribed medicine for the nausea and tested negative for covid. In all it was almost 2 weeks before I felt recovered from the vaccine.

                                                I felt numbness in my right leg, the numbness went up to my right arm and then I started slurring. This happened within a few minutes. I laid down and called a  nurse adviser. I was recommended to go to ER, so my wife took me to ER. They did CT scan of my head, then CT scan of my head and neck with contrast, then MRI of my head, then MRI of my head and neck with contrast. It was confirmed that I had an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE. It was decided to perform carotid endarterectomy surgery to remove a clot in the neck carotid artery. The clot was removed.

During the ER visit, the tingling turned into numbness (novocaine like feeling). There was also tingling in front left of tongue. Benadryl was given  (tongue tingling seemed to go away with Benadryl but nothing else) and sent home ~11:30 pm. The ER doctor advised coming back if symptoms got worse.

The next day he noticed sore shoulder at 3 PM on 4/20 he noted he had upper wrist pain that progressed to his right thumb as well as redness with a shiny quality that was consistent with previous gout flares so he took 2 doses of colchicine and 2 doses of Advil which did not relieve his symptoms.  A couple hours later he noted hand numbness and tingling as well as feet numbness and tingling bilaterally.  The numbness progressed to his extremities with the left arm more affected than the right arm (he received vaccine in his left arm).  He had accompanied pain of his extremities and wrists that was described as 10 out of 10.  He then felt 2 episodes of chest tightness and difficulty breathing prompting him to present to the strong ED.  In the ED his exam was notable for hypertension (240/90), tachycardia, wrist flexion in distress and yelling in pain.  His exam also showed bilateral hyperflexion of bilateral wrist with mild swelling and diminished sensation and motor function throughout.  He was administered IV hydromorphone, and Benadryl with dramatic improvement in his symptoms.  His labs are notable for abnormal electrolytes including magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium and he was repleted with magnesium potassium and phosphorus.  He is admitted to ED OBS. overall felt his symptoms were most likely due to gout flare and hyperventilation, not likely related to vaccine.

Pulse was thready but resolved after about 5 minutes. Had patient lay on back and elevate lower extremities. Patient felt chilly and fever-ish, but was not able to get reliable temperature at this time.

Within the next 24 hours, I started having myalgia and Paresthesia to my right leg and foot on 1/5/21, this progressively worsened. On the 6th January, the paresthesia worsened and started to occur on the left foot- anterior and dorsal surfaces. In addition, at about 21:45hrs, I started having lower back pain- severe, rated about 6/10 in severity. This progressively worsened to 10/10 in pain severity. On the 7th an, all my symptoms had worsened, despite taking Tylenol. On the 8th January 2021, I started having difficulty lifting my right foot and visited emergency room for further care. At that time I have had a series of investigations and lab work done, in addition to PCP and specialist referral including Neurologist, Physiatrist and for Physical therapy. I am still undergoing physical therapy with improvement in the weakness but I still have persistent and on going lower back pain and paresthesia in my legs and foot three months later.

He was sitting in the waiting area to be monitored when this occurred.  The nurse and I went to assist him and I told staff to call 911. The patient quickly became responsive and said that he was fine and I told staff to cancel the call for an ambulance.  I could tell he was shaken up and I asked him about any pertinent medical and medication history.  He says he has high blood pressure but took his medication that day.  He did not eat or drink anything and we gave him water and a granola bar to eat while he was waiting for his family member to pick him up.  I recommended he call his provider to inform him or her what had happened and to report the side effect to VSAFE.  I checked his blood pressure and it was 159/90 which was considered normal for him.  His brother arrived and was thankful for the help.

At the time of vaccination (11:24am), patient was feeling fine and reported no previous medical history of vaccination reactions, allergies to medications, foods, or vaccinations. After 4 minutes had passed, the patient was talking to his wife during his 15 minutes of observation when his eyes rolled behind his head and he became unconscious. Pharmacist rushed to patient?s aid. Pharmacist noticed his skin color was pale and she checked his pulse. The pulse was very weak and his O2 saturation was at 85. Pharmacist tried to wake him by asking his name and touching his shoulder. His wife was doing the same and patient remained unconscious.  Pharmacist had another  employee in the room call 911 while she administered 0.3 mg Epi Pen in left thigh. Patient finally came to and pharmacist lowered patient to the floor so that he was positioned lying down with his knees up. Heart rate was at 45, O2 saturation at 87, BP 128/90. Patient was able to state his name and know where he was but very weak. EMS arrived and checked vitals and blood sugar. EMS encouraged patient to go to hospital for further evaluation; however, patient refused to go to hospital and was educated to go to ER if symptoms returned. Patient was taken home by wife. A follow up call was made to patient at 3pm and wife stated patient was doing alright at home but very weak.

                                                7-8 Days after 2nd dose of COVID Vaccine, the skin on my fingers started to peel like they would after a sunburn.  There was no prior rash.  I can only remember around 4 days after the vaccine, my fingers felt warm as if they had a sunburn, but I had no exposure to sun, UV, or any heat source that might explain the heat/peeling.  This did not occur to my wife, who received the same vaccine at the exact same times from the exact same batch from the exact same CVS.  The only side-effect she had was a swollen thumb on the hand belonging to the arm which received the vaccine.  This last form day 2 till about day 6 after the 2nd dose.  Did not occur during 1st dose, so we don&#39;t know if its related to the vaccine.  Again, we found no other cause for the potential swollen Thumb.

                                                After about 20-30 minutes after receiving a shot in my left arm I began to feel a very minor allergic reaction. The left side of my face, neck, and mouth became slightly numb, similar to how it feels after the anesthesia in your mouth begins to subside after an appointment to the doctor&#39;s office. This lasted for about 60 minutes. No other symptoms were present outside of my left arm being somewhat sore.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

Massive tension headache and pressure behind eyes and sinus that has lasted so far for 3 weeks, tinnitus, blurred vision, joint pain, muscle weakness, muscle twitching in face and throughout body, numbness in all my limbs, burning sensations on my neck and back, stomach pain, and heart palpitations that sent me to the ER. When I walk and move my arms I feel weak. The vaccine has effected my nervous system in a terrible way. The ER doctor, ENT, PCP, Optometrist, and Opthamologist told me it was inflammation due to the vaccine. I was prescribed 6 days prednisone, 40mg for 2 days then taper down and they put me in a &#34;let&#39;s wait and see&#34; mode. All symptoms have persisted since. I follow-up with a cardiologist on 05/14/2021 and waiting appt for a neuro ophthalmologist.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 I got the 2nd shot around 3pm and felt fine throughout the rest of the day. Around 10pm when I started feeling feverish. Around 11pm, while laying in bed, it started getting much worse - shaking uncontrollably, feeling nauseous, very dizzy, fever - flu like symptoms which seemed normal for the vaccine, but then they got much worse and very strong. I couldn&#39;t fall asleep and at 1am I got out of bed to get tylenol. I took the tylenol and was still feeling naeusous so went to the bathroom. I don&#39;t remember what happened next because I fainted and woke up on the floor. I hit my head in the fall and head to get 4 staples and  had a laceration above my eye. I think I may have fainted again shortly after that but don&#39;t remember because I was out of it. I went to the ER - all tests came back normal at that point. I had covid about 2 months before the vaccine. I had no side effects from the first shot.

                                                Upon receiving the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I immediately felt tingling or chills in the arm where the shot was administered.  This developed into muscle soreness as I sat through the waiting period before leaving the facility.  (For this reason, I had taken acetaminophen at about 8:30 that morning.)  I experienced both of these symptoms after my first shot of this COVID-19 vaccine, so these did not concern me.  After taking a nap back at my house, I woke up about 3:30 p.m. experiencing some partial numbness in my left arm, which received the injection.  It was not inhibitive, but I can somewhat relate it to the neuropathy my mother experienced before being diagnosed with diabetes in 2005.  It was a bit like the tingling I first experienced after the injection, but throughout the injected arm.  As I continued through that afternoon and evening, my arm kept getting stiffer and stiffer.  This prompted me to take my temperature at about 8 p.m. and then again at 10 p.m. Both of these tests resulted in a normal temperature of 98.3 or 98.4 degrees.  By the time I was about to climb into bed at midnight, the stiffness had spread to my shoulder joint -- such that almost any movement of that arm elicited some mild discomfort, especially if I leaned against the wall with that shoulder or raised my arm above my head.  I took a third dose of acetaminophen.  My normal prone sleeping position was not comfortable with this stiffness, so I did my best to sleep on my back.  Next, I woke up too hot about 3:30 a.m. (Wednesday, May 26) and could not get back to sleep.  Full-body chills set in soon after, prompting me to turn off my ceiling fan.  I faced some mild nausea as I attempted to get comfortable in bed again.  I suspected I was feverish by at least 4 a.m., but I did not get up to check my temperature until 5 a.m. The thermometer gave a reading of 100.3 degrees, so I took another dose of acetaminophen (my fourth in 24 hours) and tried to go back to sleep.

                                                Immediate onset of L facial weakness/inability to fully close lips on L side (contract muscles) to seal lips when eating/drinking. Evaluated in ER and stroke ruled out by negative head CT and workup. Misdiagnosed as Bell&#39;s palsy, no treatment, told it could take several weeks or months to resolve and to wait it out. Upper lip tight and smile changed. Symptoms persisted and slowly worsened/progressed, overall muscle strength diminished, some bronchospasm issues with heavy exercise. Seen by PCP and allergy doctor and told likely has exercise-induced asthma and still resolving Bell&#39;s palsy. Facial symptoms continued to worsen and began involving his palate, unable to close off sinus passage way, slurred and nasal speech in the evenings, unable to chew and swallow well towards evening. Patient feared he had ALS after researching symptoms, I started to worry it was myasthenia gravis. Saw PCP again who refused to order confirmatory lab work for MG or ALS and referred to neurology. Referral turnaround was not emergent despite several calls and attempts to escalate this issue. Unable to verbally communicate in the evenings, resorted to texting to express needs. Had a scary episode of choking due to inability to swallow, 911 called to home. Sent to ER for workup and finally a neuromuscular disorder was on the differential. Transferred to a higher level of care for on-site neurology where he received IVIG x 5 days and started pyridostigmine for likely myasthenia gravis with rapid improvement in symtoms. Plan is for continued monthly IVIG and then adding an immunosuppressant long-term in addition to his pyridostigmine.

Since then, I have experienced weaker &amp; weaker tidal volume. j) Staring May 27th, I felt shallow breathing when I was at rest during the day. Since then, I have experienced weaker &amp; weaker tidal volume.

                                                throat itchy and scratchy; hard to breathe; fever; fatigue; arm pain; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer, the patient. A 31-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA vaccine; Lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 16Mar2021 at 12:00 pm (at the age of 31 years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 17Mar2021 at 1:15pm the patient developed itchy throat and scratchy, found hard to breathe (difficulty breathing), fever, fatigue and arm pain. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of itchy throat, difficulty breathing, fever, fatigue and arm pain was not resolved.   Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

Dose 2 - I had very severe body wide nerve pain, vertigo, terrible migraines, vision issues, confusion, short term memory loss and grasping for words and increased muscle weakness. It kind of mirrored a stroke. The pain was a 10/10. It was basically like all of my symptoms were getting progressively worse over the weeks. It&#39;s gotten better, but the symptoms are definitely still there. My neurologist increased the dosage of a few of my meds. At this time, they&#39;re basically managing my symptoms, but we do not have a definite source for the issue. However, the vaccine definitely caused the flare up because nothing else in my life has changed.

On 6/13 I went to a walk-in clinic to have it checked out. The NP prescribed 7 days of Naproxen 500mg and to use hot/cold treatment as needed. At the time of this form being filled out, I have a tingling sensation in my left hand and forearm, due to the Naproxen after doing research. The condition has not worsened.

This pain was subsequently replaced over the ensuing days and weeks with progressive weakness, reflex changes, and sensory abnormalities in shoulder girdle musculature and proximal upper limb. The progressive neurologic deficits of motor weakness, dysesthesias, and numbness have persisted.  Subsequent tests (MRIs and EMGs) have been ordered to confirm and/or rule out possible causes of the event.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 31-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot number: EW0167, Expiration Date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12May2021 at 08:30 (at the age of 31 years old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation in a hospital. Medical history included overactive bladder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has known allergies with beeswax. Prior to vaccine the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included tolterodine, xantofyl (LUTEIN), fish oil and vitamin d, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines in 4 weeks. When the patient got his shot of BNT162B2, the patient  felt no pain when the nurse administered the shot. On 12May2021 at 21:00, the patient started to feel numbness occasionally in the thenar muscle on the radial side of the patient&#39;s left hand. The numbness was most obvious during complex hand movements such as hand washing and but it wasn&#39;t persistent. It was further described that it felt like the sudden numbness the patient gets when he accidentally hit his elbow against the wall but less intense. The patient woke up the next day with persistent numbness in his entire left hand, affecting the wrist, palm, and all 5 fingers. This persistent numbness the patient had felt was like the numbness he gets when he was sleeping on his side with his hands under his head. It extended to the patient&#39;s distal forearm on 15May2021. At the day of the report ,the 5th day after vaccination (as reported), the soreness of the injection site had subsided but both types of numbness in the patient&#39;s left hand remained. They&#39;re were not as bad as &#34;pins and needles&#34; and there was no tingling sensation but it was concerning the patient. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of all events was not recovered.

                                                I had numbness in my right hand consistently about two hours after the shot (noticed when putting son down for bed). Figured it would go away by morning. The next morning, the numbing had left my right hand but moved mainly to my fingers and toes and was no longer constant but sporadic. Every few minutes a toe would become numb or a finger (sometimes a side of my leg or arm but usually a digit). It has lasted for a week now. Not painful but annoying. I am not getting the second dose given this side effect for a &#34;safe&#34; shot and the unknown consequence of getting what often results in worse side effects for the second shot. I feel the response from CVS and my doctor has been poor and leaves me with significant doubt on our medical system and vaccination program.

I was forwarned that the first dose primes the immune system, 2nd can be worse, so I was taking 600 mg Motrin q6 hours. Despite that, my arm progressively hurt worse and worse until now I can?t lift it above my waist. Full body aches and pains. Horrible chills and so cold. 102.1 F is highest temp so far, but that?s on top of scheduled Motrin.   Still glad that I got it, but man does it suck right now.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. The patient experienced swelling in left arm/thumb and numbness from tip of thumb to joint on opposite limb of administration.  Since Wednesday, 23Dec2020, he has been experiencing some numbness in the arm opposite of where the vaccine was administered. He clarifies the vaccine was administered in the deltoid of his right arm, and the numbness he is experiencing is in his left hand. His thumb has been partially numb since last Wednesday. He got a little bit of tingling in his left arm since last Wednesday (23Dec2020).The patient explains on Tuesday, 22Dec2020, when he was administered the vaccine he only had typical side effects that went away within 24 hours. He experienced headache and muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was administered. Both of these symptoms went away and he has recovered completely. After 24-36 hours, he noticed numbness on hand opposite of the arm where the vaccine was administered. His thumb has been partially numb which has lasted about 6 days. He clarifies the numbness is on the palm side- which he was told was not related to the nerve. His thumb looks swollen and inflamed compared to the other. He also has noticed muscle weakness in the opposite arm. The patient states he can&#39;t recall if the numbness occurred within 24 hours but he knows by 24 hours, he did have the numbness. His thumb is partially numb on the side of the palm and up to the middle of his thumb where the joint is.Patient states yesterday the numbness was noticeably worse when he was sleeping. However, today the numbness seems to be back where it was before. He forgets about the numbness since he is not actively doing anything with that particular hand, but he doesn&#39;t forget about it completely. The numbness hasn&#39;t improved any, it&#39;s been consistently there and never went away. While reading off of his card, the patient cannot determine if the Lot number is an F or an E because the number is underlined. He thinks it might be an E. Patient was able to confirm the Lot number begins with an E after looking at the information sheet he was provided. He also sees the product number, CVX 208. Patient states he has no allergic reactions and nothing that he knows of that is an underlying condition. Patient states he hasn&#39;t had any testing done in regards to these events. He wanted to talk to the manufacturer and report it to the (Contact center name) first before he schedules something at Urgent Care. He wanted to check and see if what he is experiencing is a lesser known symptom. He couldn&#39;t find this information anywhere. The outcome of events, headache and muscle soreness was recovered on 23Dec2020. The outcome of Numbness in hand was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

Pt states that this is sudden onset today. he is unsure if it is related to the recent covid vaccine but has otherwise been well. He has no recent viral sx. He has no other neuro sx. He did have some pain in the jaw at the onset but that has since resolved. CT head obtained more for the jaw pain and to ensure no mass etc. It is normal. I discussed at length with the pt that I suspect this is bells palsy as he has very minimal movement of the forehead, cannot fully blink the L eye closed and has no risk factors for stroke. I did offer him further imaging to make 100% sure this is not a stroke but he agrees that he feels he has bells palsy and declined further labs or imaging. i will have him f/u with ENT as an OP. Given return precautions and f/u with them in the office. Given first dose of steroids and valacyclovir here. He will use artificial tears and tape the eye at night. .

                                                Following the first COVID vaccine dose on Dec/18/2020, I had headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day.  The headaches were usually light, unilateral, and alternating from one side to the other. I was usually functional except on the fourth and seventh days where the headaches were moderate to severe, and I took naps to help with the headaches for those two days. I have never had an issue with headaches before, and these symptoms were a new experience for me. I did not take any medications as treatment for the headaches. Following the second COVID vaccine dose on January/7/2021, I felt fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On January/10/2021, when I woke up that morning I again felt light, unilateral, and alternating headaches. In addition, I noticed that I was unable to move the left side of my face. I felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When I looked in the mirror, I could quite noticeably see asymmetry in my face. I immediately went to the emergency department at the hospital where my primary care doctor is located. I was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation. After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, I was provided with the diagnosis of Bells Palsy. I have never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and I have never previously had a hospital stay before. The doctors prescribed medications which I am currently taking. As of today January/12/2021, the symptoms have had some improvement, but the symptoms still continue.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

A 32-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246) on 07Jan2021 at 09:00 a.m. intramuscular on left deltoid, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included omeprazole. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 at 09:00 on left arm (lot number: EK5730) and experienced headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day. Following the second dose on 07Jan2021, patient experienced fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On 10Jan2021, he noticed that was unable to move the left side of his face. He felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When looked in the mirror, he could quite noticeably see asymmetry in his face. Patient immediately visited emergency department at the hospital where his primary care doctor was located. Patient was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation (as reported). After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, patient was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He had never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and never previously had a hospital stay before. It was also informed that patient underwent Nasal Swab for SARS-CoV-2 test on an unspecified date in Dec2020 and on 10Jan2021, both resulted negative. At the time of the reporting, the symptoms continued.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of diagnosed Bells Palsy presented as unable to move the left side of his face/felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis/asymmetry in his face cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient received his vaccine and was waiting in the post-vaccination waiting space. Within 5-10 minutes he slumped in his chair and became unresponsive. Became responsive to voice but was slurring his words. Patient was diaphoretic. HR in 90s, O2 98%. His eyes rolled back in his head  suspecting vasovagal episode, we moved patient to the floor  and raised his legs. He became more responsive. Was fully oriented although did not seem incredibly alert. Cycled multiple BPs with 100s-110s/60s-70s. HR 70s-80s  supine, O2 sat 96-98%.  EMS was called for transport to ED given patient&#39;s lack of prompt recovery. We  attempted to sit patient up and he again became lightheaded and had to lie back down. While in supine position, remained with normal and stable VS. At no time did he manifest any rash, respiratory symptoms, throat or chest tightness,  abdominal discomfort, or other overt signs of anaphylaxis.   Patient was transported to the ED where ROS was reported as:   - CONST: &#43;fatigue, denies fevers or chills  - EYES: Denies vision changes  - ENT: Denies rhinorrhea, sore throat  - CV: Denies new chest pain  - RESP: Denies SOB or cough  - GI: Denies abd pain, n/v, diarrhea  - GU: Denies dysuria  - MSK: Denies new joint swelling or pain  - SKIN: Denies new lesions or rash  - NEURO: Denies new HA, numbness, or weakness  - PSYCH: Denies suicidal ideation Vitals: BP 116/67, O2 99% on RA, Temp: 97.7F, Pulse 79.  ED provider felt this was most likely vasovagal episode given occurrence following vaccine administration and associated sxs. EKG without evidence of dysrrhythmia. No PE risk factors, SOB or CP. Pt with HA that was not thunderclap nor severe in nature and was consistent with prior migranes, thus do ot suspect SAH. No hx to suggest anemia and no anemia on blood work today. No report of  seizure. Pt is alert without report of post-ictal period.

                                                About two weeks after first shot, I got shingles. It could be unrelated, but since I&#39;m young, perfectly healthy, not abnormally stressed, and haven&#39;t ever had singles before, I thought there might be a chance it is related. I&#39;ve seen online other young people who are saying that they got shingles after the first shot of Moderna or Pfizer.  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I figured it was worth reporting. It is overall a pretty mild case because I got on the antiviral drugs pretty quickly. Wondering if I should still get my second shot on schedule or wait until my shingles is all cleared. I have asked my doctor and am awaiting a response. I first noticed the symptoms on Saturday (3/20) exactly two weeks after my first shot.

On 24-MAR-21, my condition remained the same, so I attempted to contact Healthcare facility (vaccine administrator), but was then directed to consult my primary physician. The Clinic then directed me to contact the  Healthcare facility.  Eventually, I was able to get an appointment with the Clinic, and the dr proscribed me a 6-day steroid regime (Methylpredinsolone 4 MG tablet) to attempt to reduce pain.

                                                Approximately 9 days after injection in left arm, started experiencing symptoms in right armpit consistent with swollen lymph nodes including: intermittent sharp stinging pain similar to ingrown hair or inflamed hair follicle, as well redness and dull pain upon palpation. Over several days, swelling has increased significantly and pain has increased a little as well. Today, 14 days after injection in left arm, starting to experience onset of lymph node swelling in left armpit as well. Additionally, starting 9 days after injection, concomitant with lymph node swelling, I believe I have felt slightly fatigued and have felt 1 degree warmer than usual, though not actually feverish. I confirmed a temperature of 98.9F today around 5:45PM, whereas my normal temperature is about 97.7F when measured by the same method.

I&#39;m not positive if the itchy feelings began within the first 4 hours after the shot, but I think so. I took an antihistamine before bed that night. The next day I occasionally felt very minor tingling, which I believe was the itchiness diminishing. By the third day the itchiness/tingling was gone. I never developed a rash, hives, or swelling. I spoke with my primary care physician during an unrelated annual physical exam that took place a couple days after the vaccination, and he said it&#39;s possible it was a very mild allergic reaction, but in his determination it was nothing to be concerned about or to prevent me from getting the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine 21 days later.

He eventually passed out and became unconscious (5:00pm). Unfortunately he hit the ground with his head after he became unconscious. He also appeared to begin shaking while unconscious. He regained consciousness after about 20 seconds and was immediately fully alert. He stated he had no history of losing consciousness in the past. He was then taken to a nearby hospital via ambulance for evaluation and required staples to address the cut. He was discharged from the hospital around 8:00pm.

Medical exam by primary said my thyroid is a bit full.  Some post nasal drip as well.  Discomfort from the swelling became gradually more significant over several days.  Some tightness when swallowing food.   At this time of year I typically get allergy symptoms of hay fever (sneezing, itch/watery eyes, etc.) but neck swelling has never been a symptom for me.  Started taking Claritin once a day as I usually do this time of year as well.

Pt was tapped, and verbally asked if he could hear us. Initially there was no response. Checked for breathing, then begin checking for pulse, but he came to. He started speaking with us, saying he was feeling light headed, and got up to notify us, but then he couldn&#39;t remember the rest. Asked if he had a history of seizures or diabetes and he said no to either. At some point he went out again, briefly. Meanwhile, the tech called 911. He came to again, begin talking with us. At some point he requested water, which we got. After seeping, he wanted to sit up. We asked him to place his back against the wall, if he wanted to. He did so, and after a few seconds said he wanted to lay down again. EMS came. They asked if he wanted to go to the ER which he consented to. They rolled him out on a stretcher.

                                                I had a sudden case of hearing loss (felt like my ear was suddenly full of water).  I got it around 1 or 2 days after vaccination. ENT specialist diagnosed it as a side effect of the vaccine due to seeing an uptick in similar cases after vaccination.  Side effect went away after around 4 days woth no treatment. Went to ER because I had a previous case of SSHL and was afraid this was the same thing.  Also had minor arm pain in both doses.

A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 06Mar2021 09:45 (lot number: EN6205) at the age of 32 years old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Initially the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, his diagnosis was changed to rare reaction to a vaccine as per ER report in the hospital. They changed the diagnosis because it was not only his face drooping (reported as drooling) but he did not have a knee reflex or any feeling in his hands, and severe muscle pain all over his body to the extent he can&#39;t move. At the hospital they excluded Lyme disease by blood work and stroke and spinal infection by spinal tapping. Then he was discharged. All events occurred on 12Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. AEs resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab (COVID-19 PCR test): negative on 13Mar2021; and on unspecified date, blood work which excluded Lyme disease and stroke and spinal tapping which excluded spinal infection. Corticosteroid was given as treatment for the events. The patient has not recovered from the events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and an implied temporal association, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (Patient) reported himself. A 32-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer- Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Apr2021 19:00 at 32 years old (Lot number: EW0170) at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was none, his mom had high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. No vaccines were administered on the same date or within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Caller stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine on Saturday, 17Apr2021. Caller reported that 24 hours later on 18Apr2021 around 1830 to 1900, he felt pressure in the back of his head saying it was very subtle and short lived. He had pressure on back of his head behind his left ear that got progressively worse. The pressure started Sunday evening and progressed a little on Monday. It is the worst today. Caller stated that on Monday (19Apr2021) it progressed to throbbing shooting pains. Caller stated that today (20Apr2021) it is pressure or shooting pains and trouble controlling his temperature stating he went from freezing to hot to freezing to hot and headaches. Caller stated it was not consistent. If it is no pain it is just pressure. Caller stated it was on the left side in the back and occasionally came to the front noting nothing on the right side. Caller reported the injection was on the left side. Caller asked has this been reported before, is this normal, should he get it checked out. Caller also stated that he was not feeling well, mentioned his stomach and flu like symptoms on20Apr2021. It threw off his equilibrium. He felt better sitting or laying. About treatment, he just took an ibuprofen yesterday one time for pain. Caller indicated that the pain had worsened.

A contactable 32-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 32-year-old, on 15Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID (Patient had COVID probably within the first few months of COVID being a thing, so that was a while ago). Concomitant medication was not reported. patient received his first Pfizer Covid vaccine dose on 15Apr2021. The following day (16Apr2021) he experienced arm pain/soreness like &#34;someone punching me in the arm.&#34; On 18Apr2021 he states he started to feel fatigued, &#34;super worn out&#34;, and a headache (19Apr2021). Patient asked if it was normal to experience. He is not feeling too good and doesn&#39;t know if that is from the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. Caller&#39;s wife got the Moderna shot and caller got the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine shot on 15Apr2021. It seemed like his arm hurt on Friday. Saturday it seemed like he was alright. Sunday (18Apr2021) he felt pretty lethargic and kind of almost flu-like feeling, today (19Apr2021) just severe headache and just lethargic as all get out, walking to refrigerator is kind of a task. He was wondering, he heard of like the day after, but if it is a normal thing to have these events a few days after the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. He does not feel like he needs to be rushed to the hospital. Outcome of arm pain was recovered on 17Apr2021 and outcome of other events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                I got my second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot on 5/5 at 1:30PM and woke up on 05/08 at 04:30AM in extreme abdominal pain.  I was nauseous, had hot and cold flashes, and vomited.  The pain eventually moved to my lower right abdominal quadrant and I decided to go the ER at around 11:00AM. I was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and had my appendix removed at about 4PM that same day.  I was sent home Sunday at around 11:00AM.

The patient remained sitting and resting for about 20 mins during this time we offered to call 911 to which the patients wife stated that something similar to this happened before and declined the call to 911.

                                                I felt very lightheaded and woozy roughly 5 minutes after injection. I was found passed out on the bathroom floor shortly after, with no recollection of entering the bathroom. It was estimated I was out for a couple minutes. I personally wondered if it caused blood pressure to drop, but I had no way to test it and was more focused on sitting up at the time. I stayed in the waiting area until I was confident I was able to walk on my own. A second wave, though less intense, happened roughly 30-45 minutes after the first. I left the store after 2 hours with fatigue, arm pain, and the hand of the opposite arm shaking on its own. The hand stopped shaking roughly 3 hours after the injection.  Fatigue was mostly gone in a day. I could not raise my arm above chest height without pain the 1st day. Today is day two and I can raise it up properly again with mild stiffness and slight twinges of pain.

I sat with the patient in the consultation room for 20 minutes, until he became more calm. I offered him some water and I took his blood pressure every 5 minutes.  It was initially 154/105 and eventually decreased to 140/90. His heart rate was normal and he had no shortness of breath or signs of any rash. He threw up twice.  I offered to call ems for him if he wanted  but he declined. Once his blood pressure decreased he said that he felt better and sat in the pharmacy waiting area until he felt completely better. I called him 30 minutes after his departure from the pharmacy to make sure he got home safe and he was thankful for the call. I did advise him to contact his PCP if the numbness in his hand worsens or does not get better. I also told him to seek medical help if he gets any shortness of breath, rash or other unusual symptoms.

                                                I received the COVID-19 vaccine at 9:30 am from vaccination clinic. I had just recovered from COVID-19 about two and a half weeks prior. I had no immediate reaction. I worked the entire day with no adverse effects other than a sore arm, which I expected. Later in the day at about 7:45 pm I went for a 6 mile run and got home at approximately 8:49 pm. Within half an hour of getting home, I quickly became feverish. The fever continued to rise until I was extremely hot, and hotter than I can ever remember as an adult or child. I did not have access to a thermometer so I cannot reliably report what the temperature was but I am estimating 103. It felt like every part of my body, including my legs, was hot to the touch. By 1 am I had serious chills and was shivering under winter blankets despite an outdoor temperature of 70-80. In addition, I had an extremely elevated heart rate and chest pain. I also had generalized muscle aches all over my body.  I did not sleep at all that night. The fever began to slowly dissipate early in the morning but the elevated heart rate continued for approximately 24 hours. The discomfort resulting from my elevated heart rate was substantial and alarming enough that I sought advice from my primary care physician after a nurse at my Occupational Health clinic suggested potentially getting an ECG. Ultimately, by Thursday morning, the symptoms had decreased and I declined any follow up. However, this was the single worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to any vaccine and the single worst fever I&#39;ve ever experienced as an adult or in my memory as a child. Although I am aware that people who have already had COVID-19 tend to have worse reactions to the first COVID vaccine, I am filing this report primarily because of my concern that exercise may trigger an especially severe reaction.

                                                In the morning of May 2nd I was driving and I felt my heart rate increasing lasted about 30 minutes to an hour. I ended up going to the ER and I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia, I stayed overnight. After that event I developed a cognitive fog and a sensation of numbness on the left side of my head like someone is pulling the skin on my face ever so slightly. I also developed a sense of imbalance like I am in a boat for an extended period of time. These feelings remained constant and I noticed that they were getting better by May 19th. At 6 am on May 19th I walk up to the feeling of my heart pounding and my heart rate increasing, I measured my pulse on my watch and it was around 150 bpm average. This event lasted about 5 minutes and went away. On May 19th around 10 pm I was in the shower and my heart rate increase again and I felt a tickling sensation on the left side of my chest when I was breathing in. I ended up going to the ER gain and stayed overnight. May 26th I felt the sensations of fogginess and just feeling off cognitively. May 27th I woke up rested without fogginess and after a morning walk with my dog I felt my heart increasing. This episode lasted about 10-20 minutes and my heart rate was ranging between 120-150 bpm. My stools from April 20th till May 26th have been lighter in color yellowish and soft, when I consumed vegetables I could see specs of them in my stools like they were not fully processed. May 27th was the first day where my stool color was brown but still soft.

This week the pain got much more noticeable. My right arm by inside bicep has a pain of burning and itching. My right leg has burning nerve pain in multiple spots. I know my body and this is 100% because of the vaccine. The pain itself is not very bad, but it?s very noticeable. Burning sensation in different parts of my right limbs. Will this go away? I fear getting my second shot and this getting worse. Any advice?

A 32-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0191) via unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 01Jun2021 at 06:15 (at the age of 32-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to peanuts and shellfish. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 (lot number: EW0185) in arm left on 07May2021 at 07:15 as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced bed ridden and fatigue. No other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 02Jun2021 at 10:00 (AM), the patient experienced lightheaded, extreme nausea, physical weakness, headache and body ache. It was reported that the patient also experienced stiffness, chest pain, dizzy on same day. Whenever the patient was trying and stand, could not focus on screen very long without feeling like throwing up, always lightheaded, could barely turn neck, bones and joints hurt and no energy. The patient stated he received full-time care while bedridden first day and a half from his partner and continue to receive care daily as he was not able to accomplish much on his own at this point. The patient also stated he did not know if this was a permanent condition caused by the vaccine nor did he know what the extent of any permanent damage was. This was the worst body he had ever felt. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and since the vaccination. Patient was not tested COVID post vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

I advised to go to ER for evaluation. I followed up on Tues 6/8/21 and he stated the ER said he has inflammation of the heart and lungs but sent him home. Also none of the previous symptoms had resolved and he also has pain in left upper chest, decreased energy and loss of appetite. The patient said he doesn&#39;t have a PCP so I advised to go to ER again.

                                                After receiving the vaccine the patient was instructed to sit at the designated post vaccination area. As he was sitting in the chair, a few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient lost consciousness and fell from the chair onto the floor. The patient was unresponsive for a few seconds. When I positioned him in an upward position he regained consciousness and did not remember what happened. The patient had a fast heart rate and was feeling hot, dizzy, and nauseated. He showed no signs of anaphylactic/allergic reaction. Patient admitted he was nervous and anxious about the vaccine and does not like needles. I instructed the patient to remain seated on the floor and gave him an ice pack, water, and told him to take deep breathes. Patient stated he felt better. The store manager and I called 911 to get paramedics to check his vitals. Patient denied to go to emergency room, said he was feeling better. Patient confirmed he lived only a few blocks away and he had someone to drive him. Paramedics cleared the patient and stated all vitals were in normal range. Patient stayed at the pharmacy for 10 more minutes after that with instructions if he felt any symptoms to call his doctor or 911.

                                                Fatigue; light-headed; nausea; physical weakness; headache; body ache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 32-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07May2021 07:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0185) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to peanuts and shellfish allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. After the administration of first dose, the patient experienced fatigue lasting from 2 days after dose through receiving 2nd dose, light-headed, nausea, physical weakness, headache and body ache. Following questions of what were caused can&#39;t be answered. The patient received full-time care while bedridden first day and a half from his partner and continue to receive care daily as he was not able to accomplish much on his own at this point. He does not know if this was a permanent condition caused by the vaccine nor does he know what the extent of any permanent damage was. This was the worst his body has ever felt. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                I received the first covid vaccination in May 5th and a week or so later started getting tingling in my toes that would come and go.  I did not tie it to the vaccine at first as it was not a listed side effect I saw.  On 5/26/2021 I received the second shot and the tingling spread to more of my toes, and then into my hands a few days later.  After another few days my legs became very weak and I went into the Emergency Room where they diagnosed me with Guillain-Barre and my symptoms continued to worsen where I lost all my reflexes and ability to walk as usual

I sat back down for a few more minutes and then I went back to work. The the tingling stopped but my legs felt heavy for 3 days. I am feeling normal now. I am aware of orthostatic hypotension and the possibility of it being from sitting in the chair and pinching nerves. I just wanted to report this in case it is a problem.

He also added that he had a runny nose that started the same time as the headache. The body sweats were on and off, its like his body was trying to fight it.

I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                While driving home in traffic from getting the vaccine, I felt a tingling over my whole body and then everything started to spin (vertigo). This lasted for about 10 seconds of severe vertigo and then stopped. I thought that was weird and kept driving (was in stop and go traffic) then about 1 minute later it started again and thankfully I was stopped at the time in traffic. I leaned my  seat back slightly and called my wife to tell her where I am. I couldn&#39;t pull over because there was a cement barrier on one side and 4 lanes of traffic on the other. I kept on the phone with her for the remained of my drive and it occurred one more time when I was driving home. Once home, a couple more times I felt it coming on but it didn&#39;t ever happen again. I took my blood pressure and it was normal, boarderline high when I got home (140/84). The next morning I had a fever and severe muscle aches and body aches which lasted most of the day and then today I&#39;ve felt totally fine (today being 1/23).

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

It was a debilitating fever with chills and severe shaking.  I took acetaminophen with some crackers and plenty of water at 10pm.  Fever broke by 01am.  I followed with a more water and ibuprofen and fell asleep around 02am.   Following morning, I feel pretty good, slightly tired but other wise normal.   I have had no gastrointestinal or noticeable issues before or following.      The episode was near the point of going to ER.   It was something utterly unexpected and I&#39;ve never experienced a fever with no cause.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I started having radicular tingling with neck flexion that ran down my left leg starting at the beginning of February. I noted it to a colleague and asked if anyone else who had received the vaccine at the same time as me had any similar effects. I was the only person noted. Slowly the tingling increased and began radiating the entire length of the left leg. It only last for a few seconds at the beginning of flexion then completely resolved. I did not think much of this at the time and figured that it would resolve. On February 27, I began having visual disturbances and symptoms similar to vertigo with a severe nystagmus with a gaze the the right. I attempted a round of azithromycin at this time thinking that there may be an ear infection and that was causing my visual/vertigo like symptoms. There was no improvement with this course of treatment and the visual issues were becoming more of a regular issue. It became hard for me to focus anytime that I would look to my right but was able to focus my eyes while looking forward and the the left. At this time, I opted to have a brain MRI done which was completed on Match 9th as well as having basic labs run. I ended up with an elevated white count on my labs with a left shift. My MRI was read the same day showing a demyelinating process. Multiple neurologist were consulted on this and they believe that my symptoms are not related to MS as the radiologist listed as his top three on his differential but rather what they called post-covid vaccine syndrome, similar to what they are seeing with patients who actually had COVID. I have no medical history, I am not taking any medications and had no symptoms prior to the vaccine. My symptoms were acutely brought on unlike MS and I do not have any of the four most common male characteristics of MS. I do not currently have any muscle weakness, I am not fatigued, it has not progressed to my upper extremities, it does not have a stalking glove approach but rather shoots down, I have no sexual dysfunction. I have been started on a high dose prednisone taper as recommended by the neurologist. My biggest concern is that when I looked for information as a medical provider, I was unable to find anything related to neurological issues and the vaccine. Once, I was placed in contact with multiple neurologist, I was told that they are seen quite a few neurological adverse events.

I felt lightheaded and dizzy and then I broke out into a cold sweat followed by blurry vision. I felt as though I was going to pass out. These symptoms lasted for approximately 10-12 minutes after starting and then I started to feel better. I then experienced a headache in just above the base of my neck in the back of my head and that lasted for approximately 5 minutes.

                                                an hour after my injection I had tingling and numb sensation on my face. I checked in the mirror to see if i was having a stroke but I was fine. I was still numb and tingly so I went to the ER (03/8/21) a few days later. its now been 2 weeks and I get the numbness and tingling off and on. Doctors say to just keep an eye on it and make sure I don&#39;t get any drooping. I can still feel myself touch my face but it still has a tingly numb sensation.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had no known allergies. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination.  On 21Mar2021 at 07:30 PM, after receiving his first dose, he began noticing facial drooping, which began to intensify, on the right side. He was advised by a medical professional to immediately call an ambulance and he was then taken to an emergency room where received a CT scan and full bloodwork on Mar2021. Luckily, the facial palsy began to subside and he was able to return home after the test results came back and a stroke was ruled out - it was stated that this was some kind of immuno-reaction to the vaccine. He still felt as though his face was still not 100% back to normal and still felt a bit droopy (noticeable in the mirror) yet it does feel better than on 21Mar2021 evening. Patient had a nasal swab on 22Mar2021 with negative result. One of the reporters is a psychologist and reported that her son received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Psychologist asking about risk of Bell&#39;s palsy, incidence, and outcomes and if these patients received their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. She read about 7 cases of Bell&#39;s palsy in a Dec2020 article in the [Redacted], 4 of them on the Pfizer vaccine. The reporter further clarified and described that at 6pm (2 hours after dose), patient reported he felt fine and was happy he got the vaccine; but then sometime after that, he reported &#34;strange feelings in face&#34; and then eyes started drooping and then mouth started drooping, all on right side of face. They called the university clinic and was instructed to go to ER. Brain scans and blood work were done; they ruled out stroke and said it was a possible reaction to the vaccine. He was discharged at midnight and by then, paralysis was 80-85% resolved. He is an otherwise very healthy young man. The psychologist wanted to know the efficacy after just one dose and stated that a friend suggested to perhaps not get second dose and consider getting a dose of the non mRNA vaccine like Johnson and Johnson.  The outcome of the event was recovering.   Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient presented for his first vaccine dose. He later stated he felt a sensation of something moving through his arm after vaccine administered, then states he felt some increased anxiety, followed by cold sweats, and then lost consciousness.  He was noted to be unresponsive, initially with brief period of apnea, and was unresponsive to sternal rub by vaccine administration staff.  He was placed into a reclined position in the driver seat of his vehicle. He regained consciousness within a minute, and was normally responsive but with pale color noted to face and chest, diaphoresis, and thready pulse with bradycardia, HR 43.  Difficult to auscultate HR and breath sounds clear but shallow. EMS responded promptly and assisted with evaluation, with initial BP 80/50, SpO2 97%.  Patient became less responsive and started to lose consciousness again, but responded to questioning, then lost consciousness again. His feet were placed on the dashboard to elevate them, and he quickly regained consciousness, pulse improved to HR 86, and repeat BP after a few minutes was 140/76. Oxygen saturations briefly dipped to 90% then rebounded to 100%. He improved quickly, was normally responsive and able to drink orange juice. He had pale clammy skin on the face, neck and hands, and some facial flushing.  Patient was monitored for several minutes, had improvement in symptoms, and refused transport by stretcher to the ambulance. He was able to walk to the passenger side of his vehicle and was driven out of the vaccination facility and further monitored. Blood glucose noted to be 96, EKG normal with sinus rhythm, no acute ST or T wave changes or other acute abnormality.   Patient was offered transport to the hospital for further evaluation, but he declined. Symptoms resolved completely, he was monitored for resolution of symptoms. He reported prior similar symptoms after a hand laceration at work and after a dental visit. Risks discussed, prevention measures for second dose discussed. Encouraged follow up with PCP given recurrent vasovagal syncope. No signs of allergy noted.

I had him lie down on the floor with his feet up for about 10 minutes until he felt confident to sit in the chair for another 10 minutes or so.  As he was lying on the floor, We brought him a bottle of water.  His color came back shortly after lying down on the floor.  He stated that he has previously had panic attacks after shots, blood draws, etc.  He stated he was no longer dizzy when he stood up to leave.

We gave him an ice pack and monitored him for 30 minutes after. His blood pressure was 90/60 a few minutes after the episode but then it came up to 124/84 a few minutes later. His eyes were dilated and we were concerned about a possible concussion from the fall so EMS came and evaluated him. They cleared him to go home.

Today (4/13/21)  I had strong fatigue and needed to rest after work for at least an hour. In addition, last night (4/12/21) I experienced slight pain in my lower to middle right  leg.  It went away after a while.  I?m a kidney transplant patient so there are many variables to take into consideration.

                                                3 days after the vaccine I started feeling extremely jittery with numbness in my arms and legs. My heart rate increased and I was finding it very difficult to stay calm or focused. This has been persistent since. Body seems warmer than usual and numbness/tingling sensation is still an issue.

                                                Within 2 minutes of vaccine i became very light headed and needed to lay down and was sweating. This is common with me with any vaccine. Within 24 hours severe shortness of breath and severe chest pains. Went to 2 urgent cares. Was prescribed Prednisone and a Inhaler. Both did nothing. Symptoms got worse. went to my primary doctor who ordered a chest X ray which came back good. and a EKG which came back with a slight issue and referred me to a cardiologist next month. Was sent home to recover. Pain and shortness of breath got worse. Within a week after that i got severe headaches and the left side of my head arm and leg began to get numb and tingle sensation  which lasted about 48 hours. About 2 weeks after vaccine i began to improve. Chest pain started to go away and my shortness of breath as well. As of today 4-18-2021 no chest pain, and shortness of breath still comes and goes but nothing compared to weeks before.

A 33-year-old patient (husband) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 05Apr2021 15:40 (Lot Number: ER8734) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atopic dermatitis. Concomitant medication included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), an injection that patient takes every other week to control his atopic dermatitis, he has been using this for 3 years at least. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER6207) in left shoulder on 15Mar2021 15:40, at the age of 32 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, and experienced arm sore and body aches. The patient experienced vomiting blood in Apr2021, blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up / spitting up blood in Apr2021, he feels like his throat is so raw on 05Apr2021, sore arm on 05Apr2021, feeling achy/ her husband is still sore/achy today on 05Apr2021, nauseous on 05Apr2021, vomiting/ throwing up on 05Apr2021, diarrhea on 05Apr2021, chilly in Apr2021, redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids; his pores looked red in Apr2021, fatigue on 05Apr2021. No treatment received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events pain in arm, ache, nauseous, erythema, fatigue was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Clinical course as reported: Her husband got their second dose of the vaccine on 05Apr2021. Her husband was having a more severe reaction than the first time. The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller&#39;s husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o&#39;clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn&#39;t like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid. Wife added what she was trying to see was if she should take her husband to the hospital or not.

                                                The patient began feeling light-headed and diaphoretic immediately after vaccine administration. He was taken by wheelchair to a medical exam table to recline, with feet elevated on pillows. He stated he had not had anything to eat that morning or the evening prior. He was offered juice, and would take sips if it was held to his mouth, however did not want to eat any crackers. He was not verbal, answering questions by shaking his head yes or now only. Unsure if he remained oriented. He was also noted to have a brief syncopal episode. He was noted to be shaky and anxious. He complained of lethargy and was unable to bear weight/walk.  His vitals upon arriving at the exam table were: BP 110/64 HR 45 SpO2 97% It was determined by RN that he may be hypoglycemic. No glucometer was available. She stated he was not able to tell them if he was diabetic. She decided to administer 1mg glucagon subcutaneously. He also continued sipping on apple juice. His vitals were repeated five minutes later and at that time were: 110/82 HR 84 SpO2 96% Ten minutes after this: 122/80 HR 74 SpO2 95%.  This was now 1045. He was complaining of his head spinning when he tried to sit up and remained shaky. He was unable to stand or walk independently. At this time it was recommended that he go to the emergency room or urgent care. He denied an ambulance, but stated his mother could come pick him up and take him to the emergency room. She was contacted, arrived at 1105.  His last set of vitals remained within normal limits at 1106. He was taken by wheelchair to his mother&#39;s car.

I also had occasional slight headaches during the day on 5/1. After the fever symptoms went away, the were immediately replaced by: runny nose, sneezing, some coughing, a slight wheeze (only lasted from 3 AM to 4 AM), slight chest tightness, itchy mouth/tongue, and throat tightness. All of those lasted until around 11 AM on 5/2. Only a slight throat tightness remains now (noon on 5/2).

It evolved into a fairly intense headache for which he took some ibuprofen.  He had chills and fevers and felt very poorly.  At 7 AM on Saturday, April 24 he suffered excruciating substernal chest pain.  It was a burning sensation and it was so severe he wanted to die to relieve the pain. The pain was only minimally positional and it was nonpleuritic. He drove himself to the nearest hospital and even drove through some red lights to get there more quickly.  When he arrived he had ST elevation in the same leads with his early repolarization which was perhaps a millimeter or so higher than the EKG we did in February.  He had both an elevation of his troponin levels which were 5.07, 6.06, 5.72 and 5.73.  A CK was 195 with an MB of 41.2.  He was taken to the cath lab emergently.  no coronary disease.

                                                Pt reported with the 1st dose his left arm as sore for a couple of days. Pt reported with the 2nd dose, he felt feverish but sxs has subsided. On 4/29/2021, pt reported he felt sluggish and warm. Currently he reports there&#39;s a red patchy appearance at the injection site (left arm) that looks ~3 inch in diameter, and he reports he can feel a lump when placing his hand over the injection site area and it feels warm to the touch. Pt also reports that he can feel some pain with arm movements, but not at rest. Advised pt ADEs are more common with 2nd dose and ADEs usually occurs within the first 3 days and should resolve after 1-2 of onset. Recommend pt can place ice pack for 15 minutes on and 15 minutes off as need to help with the warm sensation in the left arm; can also take Ibuprofen PRN for pain. Recommend pt to stay hydrated and wear loose fitting clothing to keep the area cool. Recommend if symptoms worsen or intensify to contact MD or go to urgent care to get evaluated.  Patient feeling much better, no longer has pain at injection site still has lump and redness but both have decreased in size.

Got better for three or four days then,  At first, dizziness and lightheadedness upon standing up, nearly fainting.    Within another week, intermittent heart racing, elevated blood pressure episodes followed by headaches.    By three weeks out from second dose my headaches became constant, some devolving into migraines, relegating me to my bed.  Headaches are now constant, from morning until night, intermittent heart racing and bouts of light headedness are nearly every day.

I got a severe reaction from the Pfizer vaccine. I got the normal chills the next day and flu symptoms. From the next day to day 5 I got severe headaches, strong pain in my head, my left arm and left eye. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen within those days. The Tylenol didn&#39;t help at all, ibuprofen 200mg didn&#39;t do much. Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot. I heard the first dose 80-90 percent immunity or even more. With my body I never had this reaction. Today I&#39;m a whole lot better (day 6). I am too putting too much, should I wait 90 days other say 4 weeks. What to do about the 2nd dose? How about using antihistamines during/after my second dose?

                                                Patient post-vaccination (Pfizer/0.3ml/1st dose administered @10:23a) appeared to be seizing in his chair during observation @ 10:26a.  I rushed to him, requesting aid from his colleagues to help lay him on the ground and elevate his feet. He was unresponsive and disoriented, with shallow breathing and weak pulse, so I activated EMS @ 10:26a.  He appeared to seize again so I instructed two men to help roll him onto his side, at which time, an RN managing the vaccines, took over monitoring while I talked to 911.  EMS was on scene @ 10:29a. RN reports he&#39;d had a vagal response, most likely due to witnessed severe anxiety during IM injection (name /right deltoid @ 10:23a). RN gave him Gatorade and he quickly became AOx3.  When EMS arrived, he was able to stand up, with assist, and be placed on the gurney.  EMS monitored him for ~ 20min onsite, at which time he became hypotensive, resulting in transport to the nearest ER with O2 and IV management.  Per HR representative for a business patient was discharged @ ~2p the same day, with diagnosis of severe dehydration and hypokalemia, his reaction most likely a vagal event.  Unknown if medications were given outpatient.

                                                At approximately 5:20pm on 5/10/21 I started having jumbled speech. I would be speaking clearly and then random words would take the place of the words I was trying to say. I was unable to use the correct words my brain was telling myself to say. Then I started experiencing tingling sensation throughout my right arm. Believing that I could be having a stroke my wife rushed me to the emergency room at hospital. En route to the ER, my left arm began to have tingling sensation in it as well. Once at the ER I began hyperventilating. I was in the ER for approximately 4-5 hours, for 3 of those hours I had difficulty communicating and could not speak clearly. I was told I may have been having a complex migraine and was discharged and referred to a neurologist. I met with the neurologist and given that I have no history of headaches or migraines, they concluded that it most likely was not a complex migraine and discussed the possibility of an immune response. It has now been a week since my ER visit, since then I have been getting extremely fatigued every afternoon and my head feels spacey.

This 33-year-old male nurse (Patient) received first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via Intramuscular in left arm on 04Jan2021 at 10:00 and second dose via Intramuscular in left arm on 27Jan2021 at 12:30, both as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient tested with COVID-19 post vaccination was unknown. On 27Jan2021 at 17:00, the patient experienced mild fever of 100.4, headache aches, sore arm, fatigue. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (19Apr2021): This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

He has to hold on to walls to walk.; Patient started to get terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness.; patient cannot walk; Severe back pain; both feet have numbness and tingling; This is a spontaneous report from Pfizer. A contactable nurse (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 33-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13Apr2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0153) (at the age of 33 years old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included surgery on his leg (when he was 17) and cold. There were no concomitant medications. Patient had a severe reaction to the covid vaccine. On 17Apr2021 at 08:00, the patient had severe back pain. On Sunday morning (25Apr2021), patient had severe back pain. Patient was a former college athlete. Patient was mentally healthy and physically fit. Patient did not remember getting hurt while playing golf. Patient iced his back and did some stretches. Patient called his friend who is a doctor, and his friend told him he did the right thing by icing and stretching.  A few days later, either Tuesday evening, 27Apr2021 or Wednesday, 28Apr2021, patient started to get terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness. Patient was able to get down a flight of stairs and then called an uber. Patient was taken to the hospital. It was his left foot and left leg initially. Now both feet have numbness and tingling. It was hard for him to walk. He has to hold on to walls to walk (also reported as Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness. Patient cannot walk. Patient can now only stand if he is holding a wall).  He went to the emergency department on 29Apr2021 and got an MRI of back and lower legs, &#34;all was negative for slip disc or spinal cord swelling.  Patient had an MRI of his lower back, and legs. The MRI results were that patient had no spinal cord compression that would cause his left lower leg numbness. Patient was admitted to the hospital, to the neurology department, with a consult for a neurosurgeon to see him. The doctors agreed that he had something going on since he had left lower leg numbness. In the course of four days, Thursday through Sunday, patient was admitted to hospital in the neurology unit. Patient was in an overflow area. Several hospitals around that area have closed, so now the hospital is seeing so many more patients, and the hospital is over capacity. Patient was admitted by a hospitalist, and then was referred to a neurology team. The doctors said that that does not explain patient&#39;s symptoms, so the doctors ordered a head to toe MRI with contrast.  He was admitted to the hospital and continued to have severe back pain then, the doctors did another head to toe MRI with contrast and then they said he has &#34;MS due to brain lesions and spinal cord swelling the length of his spinal cord.&#34; They also did a spinal tap. The family kept telling the MDs that he had just received his Pfizer vaccine. The patient denies any weakness or numbness in past 6 months. He continues to have numbness in both feet and now the left leg is always numb. The doctors gave him an outpatient appt at the end of June. It felt like whenever he sits on his foot while watching TV, and it starts going numb. By the time that patient was getting testing done, the nurses covered patient&#39;s eyes, and told patient to tell them whenever he could feel it. The doctors and nurses were sticking pens in patient&#39;s feet, and patient could not feel it at all. Patient could only feel pressure. On Friday, 30Apr2021, patient had a head to toe MRI with contrast. Reporter thinks that patient got back to his room after the total body MRI about 22:15. The head to toe MRI with contrast revealed that patient had spinal cord swelling, and lesions in the brain. Doctors diagnosed patient with multiple sclerosis. Patient has never had any symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Reporter&#39;s husband feels like patient could have transverse myelitis, because some vaccines can cause that. Reporter&#39;s husband asked patient&#39;s doctor to contact Pfizer to see if there was anything in place about how to treat this. On Thursday, patient&#39;s doctor told reporter&#39;s husband that there had been no reported adverse effects of spinal cord swelling from the covid vaccine. On Sunday, whenever patient was discharged, patient&#39;s doctor told reporter&#39;s husband that he was not going to call and report about patient to Pfizer, and that there had already been 45 documented cases. This was a really big red flag to reporter. Patient cannot walk. Patient can now only stand if he is holding a wall. Before this, he was totally healthy. Patient was discharged from the hospital on Sunday. The hospital sent his MRI results, lab work, and spinal tap fluid after his MRI to Clinic. The doctors did the spinal tap on patient to make sure he did not have an infection. Patient did not have an infection. The doctor started patient on Lyrica and some other drug. The hospital told patient to call back in two weeks, because by then they would have stuff back from Clinic, and then he could make a follow up appointment. Upon discharge, patient was told that maybe he could get a follow up appointment in Jun2021. Everything that reporter has read, says that patient&#39;s condition needs to be followed up on as soon as possible. Patient cannot walk. This is going to financially cripple patient. Reporter is sure that after this, patient will meet his deductible and is going to have to pay out all of this money to cover his hospital stay and testing. Before the COVID vaccine, patient did not have any problems at all. Patient had to have surgery on his leg when he was 17. Patient has no history of back pain. By the time the doctors and nurses did testing, that was late Friday evening, 30Apr2021 or Saturday morning, 01May2021. By the time that the testing was done, both of patient&#39;s feet and left leg were totally numb. The hospital said that patient&#39;s symptoms were terrible, and that he had something acute going on. The hospital ran tests on patient. Patient told the doctors at the hospital that he had recently received the COVID vaccine. Patient was never sick he might get a cold every once in a while. Other than that, patient only sees the doctor once a year for a physical. The hospital did preliminary lab work on patient. Patient&#39;s vital signs were stable, and he had no fever.  After patient received three doses of IV Solu-Medrol, his back pain went away. Patient&#39;s doctors felt like patient&#39;s spinal cord swelling had diminished. Patient&#39;s doctors felt like patient&#39;s spinal cord swelling is what cause patient&#39;s numbness and tingling. The first dose of IV Solu-Medrol was given sometime on 30Apr2021. Patient received IV Solu-Medrol 1 gram, three days in a row.The doctors said that was all they were going to do at this time. The doctors wanted to wait to see what the lumbar puncture shows (unknown results). Patient was given IV Solu-Medrol while in the hospital. Patient was put on Lyrica and gabapentin. The doctors are hoping that those two medications will make his symptoms go away. Patient used to take a multivitamin for years, but reporter does not know if patient still takes that. Patient is super healthy. Patient was admitted to the hospital on 29Apr2021, and discharged on 02May2021 after receiving his last dose of IV Solu-Medrol. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had Nasal Swab (COVID test) on 28Apr2021 and was negative.  Event relatedness to Pfizer COVID vaccine: Severe back pain and Patient started to get terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness. Patient cannot walk. Patient can now only stand if he is holding a wall was related. Reporter stated that she thinks his symptoms are medically significant, but they could be disabling. If the COVID vaccine gave patient multiple sclerosis or transverse myelitis, this could be disabling. The outcome of the event back pain was recovered in May2021; event spinal cord swelling was recovering; events &#34;terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness and It was hard for him to walk. He has to hold on to walls to walk&#34; were not recovered; and unknown outcome for the other events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the multiple sclerosis,  transverse myelitis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.   There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including spinal MRI at baseline, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The following morning, I had body aches, headaches and I took some Tylenol. They only lasted through the late afternoon and early evening. And then following that, in the weeks following, I started noticing I would get headaches two or three times a week and often it would be something that I would get a headache at night and it would worsen in the morning and it would last for 24 hours before it would go away. Sometimes I took Tylenol and sometimes I would just try massaging it .On,  February 17,  I saw  my doctor and he told me to try Aleve instead and to up the dose of it. When I do that it curbs the headaches a bit for sure. Since seeing him, this week I had two and the two weeks prior I didn&#39;t have any. They start in the back of the neck and go to my upper back and when it is at its worse: goes to the  tops and sides of  my head. Pretty debilitating - I couldn&#39;t do a whole lot when I have these. I had one yesterday into this morning. I don&#39;t know if it has to do with the vaccine.  I got my first dose of the vaccine on December 23 and they had told to wait for the second dose because I got COVID after the first day.

I thought it was getting better but then a week or so after my second shot I began having worse leg problems (weakness, pains, pulsing, numbness, tingling).  It?s just gotten worse and I?m having tests done and seeing a neurologist.

I would rate this as on par with worst sicknesses I have ever had in my life. For next approx. 30 hours - soreness all over body, head aches, not as bad as previous day.  Next 24 hours - Soreness on right side, akin to being hit by a baseball fastball in 4 spots on my right side (arm, leg, 2 spots on body) about every 5 minutes. Next 24 hours leg every muscle from knee to hip was sore and hardly moveable like I had participated in an all day sporting event the day before.  For the next week or so I had aftershock headaches, occassional mild headaches that would last for less then a minute. Gradually went down in duration and frequency over time.  Also that next week, felt very fatigued and low energy.

A 33-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0177 and Expiration date: unknown), dose 1 via an unknown route of administration on 20May2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included stroke from 2019 that was caused because the heart valve, PFO, never closed when he was born so he had an occluder put in. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken once a day for an unspecified indication and ongoing. On 20May2021, the patient experienced sore arm and a little fatigue. He has scheduled to get the second dose on 10Jun2021. Outcome of events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient wasn&#39;t diagnosed with COVID-19. After about 7-10 days after 2nd dose vaccination he became very dizzy and fatigued, and had extreme brain fog and light headedness. There where times where he felt he was going to pass out. He also had shortness of breath, tightness in throat and dry mouth. He also developed a very strong metal taste in his mouth that lasted for a few weeks. Sometimes he would also get strange sensations or weakness in his muscles with sweats or hot flashes. Some days he would wake up feeling like he was intoxicated like a drunk feeling. The feelings also came with extreme anexity and panic although the symptoms themselves could have caused that. The onset date of events was reported as 14May2021 02:30 am. No treatment received for events. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was resolving.

                                                My reactions to the second shot started with a sore arm, night sweating for the first day of injection (5/9). In the morning of the two days after the shot, there are also some minor nose bleedings. The primary reason I&#39;m reporting is because of the symptoms below:  On 5/10, I suffered from fatigue that I had to sleep every other couple of hours. In the night the adverse event that resembled myocarditis occurred when I went to bed (around 10 PM). The symptoms included respiratory difficulties/shortness of breath and severe chest pain especially when lying on my back, and pains in the upper body mostly in both arms. As a result, I wasn&#39;t able to sleep until 4 AM when these symptoms started to reduce. However the fatigue and periodic shortness of breath persisted for a couple of more days.   I recognized these symptoms are much like the ones I experienced once in 2018, although I was able to get a diagnosis of myocarditis after being tested with ECG and blood tests. During that event the trajectory of serverless and recovery was similar.

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.

                                                Tendonitis, debilitating neuralgias leading to 2.5 weeks of missed work  No issues immediately after injection.  About 12 hours later had severe arm pain limiting motion in L arm.  Slowly improved but never resolved.  Started to get worse again on day 7/8 with pain in deltoid, tricep, bicep, forearm.   Should pain on day 10 while in bed reaching for covers - limited ability to do normal task (lift arm to turn on turn signal).  No improvement with ibuprofen.  Right shoulder pain started the following day.  Was given medrol dose pack with some improvement for 2 days but bilateral shoulder pain worsened by day 2 of steroids.  Heard pop in Right groin while sliding in bed on day 3 of steroids.  Painful causing limping while walking for several days.  On 1/13/21, severe pain in groin when standing leading to ER visit (Xray negative).  MD described as tendonitis of adductor muscle.  Pain radiated down leg to knee and to hip.  The following day similar pains occurred in the left leg.  Pain &#34;bounced&#34; between bilateral upper and lower proximal muscles and tendons.  Had stiffening of R arm on 1/15/21 and 1/16/21 associated with numbness in hand.  Went to ED again.  inflammatory markers were negative.  ANA was positive for RNP antibodies but the titer was low.  rheumatoid factor low.  TSH normal.  ED MD said she would call it polymyalgia rheumatica but I was 40 years too young.  Bouncing severe neuralgia type pain lasted about 2 weeks.  It started to resolve with scheduled naproxen and daily physical therapy multiple times per day.  It&#39;s 2/13/21 and I am still taking NSAIDs and doing PT and have residual shoulder impingement with upward arm movements, have limited ability to lift objects that I previously could and also have difficulty standing for rounds (critical care clinical pharmacist).

He said that he felt a little dizzy and hot and started to feel nauseous. The pharmacist gave him a cold compress and had him lie on the ground and elevate his feet. After about 10 minutes the patient said he felt fine so we helped him back in his chair and asked that he stay longer for us to monitor him. He waiting an additional 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left.

                                                Left arm was incapacitated for nearly a week after the initial injection. Arm could not be lifted more than a few inches away from torso, and pain felt like severe deep cramping constantly. No bruising or mark at the site of the injection just severe muscle pain that affected all movement and sleep.  After one week I regained more mobility but still had severe pain in the shoulder muscles around injection site. At the 3 week mark I have more mobility but still struggle with a full range of motion and lifting anything more than a few pounds.

On 03/28/2021, I began to notice chest pain and simultaneous pain in my left arm on 03/28/2021. The fever, chills, headache, and general soreness subsided on 03/29/2021, but the periodic chest and arm pain persisted and continued to get worse. On 03/29/2021 I also had nausea/vomiting and sweating. On the morning of 03/30/2021 during an episode of chest and arm pain we went to the Emergency Department at. At the emergency department, they detected elevated troponin levels indicating damage to the heart muscle. I was rushed via ambulance for an emergency heart catheterization. I was admitted to the hospital and monitored while various other tests were performed. It was determined that there was inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis).

                                                Sore left arm, muscle soreness, fatigue waking up the next day. Around 24 hrs after vaccination, headache started, and lasted for ~8 hours. I took some advil around an hour before the headache stopped (really wish I&#39;d taken it when I first felt the headache). I could feel the muscle soreness go away before the headache did. The headache felt like it moved from behind my eyes to the back of my head. I decided to only eat bits and pieces of stuff when I was feeling my worst because I was concerned that would make me feel nauseated (never did feel that way, so no idea if that made a difference). I drank probably 200oz of liquid throughout the day, but still felt dehydrated, even though I wasn&#39;t sweating. Did pee a lot though. Generally it was what I expected, but a friend who works at a hospital said I should report the info.

                                                When I got the shot I felt okay for the rest of the day, but the injection site on my right arm hurt a bit for the rest of the day. The next morning my right arm still hurt, but it was not worst. However my left hand and left elbow felt very stiff. When I tried to bend my left elbow it hurt a bit. When I tried to bend my fingers on my left hand it hurt very much. I couldn&#39;t even make a fist it hurt so much. I kept slowly bending my elbow and bending my fingers until the pain and stiffness would go away. Most of the pain and stiffness went away, but a little still remained. It feels like I have some kind of Arthritis in my left hand and left elbow, but I have never had it before. Since I got the COVID-19 vaccine, every time I wake up I have been experience the same thing.

He was scheduled for a routine doctor&#39;s appointment late Tuesday afternoon. At the doctor&#39;s office he had a seizure, which caused him to lose consciousness for 15 seconds.

He was admitted and stayed in the hospital for 2 nights.  An MRI found micro-bleeds on his brain. He was treated with lamotrigine and sent home with a prescription for 25mg/twice daily.

                                                2-4 hours after the injection experienced ulnar nerve pain and paraesthesia, tingles and pins and needles sensation in pinky and ring finger of the right (injection side) hand. Over the course of 6 days the paraesthesia spread distally to both hands and feet and cheeks. Symptoms persist at day 38 accompanied by mild fatigue. Per my Dr&#39;s recommendation I&#39;ve skipped the second dose. Reading a lot of folks online are experiencing tingles, paraesthesias and similar side effects.

He stated he usually feels that way after medical situations such as vaccinations and blood draws. Client was offered to go to a more private area and refused. MRC volunteer got cool paper towels to place on his forehead and client requested to continue  to lay down where he was. After about 10 minutes client wanted to sit back up and reported he was not as dizzy any more. He sat up with ease and no difficulty and he stated he was not feeling as dizzy. After sitting for a few minutes he received notification that his observation period was over and he stated that he was ready to go. I assisted him down the bleachers and out of the outreach facility, he had a steady gait and stated he was feeling, much better. He left the facility with his partner.

                                                Within 15 minutes of receiving my first dose of the Phizer vaccine a portion of my arm went numb as if I received Novocain from the Dentist. This only impacted the portion of my arm between my elbow and shoulder. My hand was not numb. My entire head also felt as if I was coming off Novacain. I would also get hot and cold flashes. My upper body was itchy. I also felt like I was having circulation issues (like if you sleep in a weird position). The tips of my fingers and toes would be cold. I believe the Novacain issue was attributable to the shot but some of my other issues might have been the result of a panic attack as a result of my face going numb. I went to the ER but by the time I saw the doctor around 12:00pm most of these symptoms were going away. I went to bed and woke up much better. I can feel my arm now. It just feels sore but what I expected it to feel like after the shot. The Novacain feeling in my head went away now I just have a mild headache. The key symptom I was concerned about was the Novacain feeling given my wife also received the shot and did not have this experience.

                                                Main symptom: Around 10 hours after receiving the vaccine, my right ankle felt slightly numb. I also had a sharp, painful shooting pain in the middle of the sole of my foot that lasted less than a second. As the night progressed, the numb area spread slowly to other parts of my foot.  When I woke up the following day (today), I was surprised to discover I was not only still numb, but the numbness had spread across the entire outside of my right foot (from my ankle to 3/4 of the distance to my pinky toe).   Now, several hours later at 8:30pm, the numbness reaches all the way from near my pinky toe on my right foot up to the bottom of my calf. All of the numbness is isolated to the right side of my right lower extremities and has not crossed over to the middle of any of my extremities yet.   I can also feel a slight numb sensation in my left index finger stretching to the base of my left thumb, but it isn&#39;t nearly as bad as my right foot. I haven&#39;t felt any addition sharp shooting pains.  Numbness aside, I had a pretty bad headache from about 4pm to 10pm yesterday, and when I closed my eyes saw what appeared to be mild hallucinations (green and red streaks that disappeared pretty quickly, and were only visible when my eyes were closed). I&#39;m no longer having the visual symptoms, but the numbness is getting worse by the hour.  I have NEVER had any of these symptoms before in my life, and did nothing out of the ordinary yesterday or today in terms of food or physical activities. I take no medications.

                                                First dose of vaccine received on April 6. Soreness in arm for remainder of day, slight fever to 100.5 that night. No symptoms for remainder of week. Slight cough began in the morning on April 12, no other symptoms at that point. Woke up on April 13 with 101.4 F temperature, and throat soreness that made swallowing incredibly painful. Sore throat has made continuous sleep nearly impossible for the next two days (so far), as whenever I swallow I wake myself up, which happens every 10-15 minutes. This has resulted in general fatigue throughout the day. Fever, sore throat, coughing all get worse at night time. Average temperature during the day has been 99.5 F, while temperature readings after 10 PM have been in the 101-102 F range. Appears to be semi-breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. after first dose of vaccine, but before second dose), based on timing of symptoms and subsequent positive PCR test.

                                                Within an hour of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel &#34;odd&#34; (i.e heart racing, spine tingling, strange sensations in my hands, and dizziness).  At the hour mark, while trying to &#34;walk it off&#34; inside my backyard, things escalated quickly.  As I came back inside, I suddenly collapsed and and lost consciousness.  Luckily my best friend was with me and she described my behavior as a full on seizure (which I am not predisposed to).  According to her, I was flopping around, spitting wildly and drooling all over my face, my eyes wide and glazed staring into nothing, lips turning blue.  She immediately called 911 and within 5-10 minutes, two EMT&#39;s arrived and began to speak to me and take my vitals.  For a good 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t sit up and had to lay on the ground, still extremely out of it - unable to think, merely in extreme discomfort similar to the most intense flu I&#39;ve ever experienced.  After a half hour or so, I sat up and was able to thank them for helping me and answer some of their questions.  Over another 15 or so minutes they said all my vitals were perfect and they were not worried about me - sure I&#39;d make a full recovery, which I hope I did.  I am feeling MUCH better today.  The reason I felt it so important to submit this report is because I had never heard of anyone experiencing side-effects that severe.  Of course I had heard it could wipe you out, give you chills, aches, and exhaustion - but I had never heard that it could lead to a seizure so scary that my best friend thought I might be dying.  I truly don&#39;t know what might have happened without her.  People should know to have someone at home with them after the second dose.  I am not over-exaggerating about my symptoms whatsoever.  My body still hurts all over and I feel as if I went through some type of gauntlet yesterday.  I absolutely do NOT want to discourage anyone from getting the vaccine, but I wish I had some notion that something so severe could happen to me.

It?s been recurring pain especially when I move my arm in certain ways. No health insurance at the moment, haven?t seen a physician about this or received an MRI.  The more concerning though is recurring vertigo I?ve been experiencing. I have never had it before, but a few days after I?m receiving the dose my eyes started shaking involuntarily and I had difficulty keeping my balance.  It went away after a bit, but has happened a number of times over the last two weeks.  I?m obviously hoping it just goes away.

                                                My husband had stork like symptom on 16APR, starting at 11:30 am. He was in a conference call, and suddenly felt dizzy, voice change, drooling, sleepy. When he came downstairs, he could not hold himself, and I noticed his mouth was tilted to the left with drooling, and weakness on his left side. We had him sitting in the chair and I drove him to the ER immediately.

                                                I had a nasty zit on the back of my neck, popped it, and my immune response was extreme. Initial: Itching and burning through my neck and shoulders, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and collarbone. I began sweating at night profusely and losing weight. I have had a lot of trouble sleeping. These symptoms continued in 24-48 hour cycles of flare ups until 04/19/2021 but finally seem to be abating. Progression: secondary symptoms appeared over the course of the month such as full body joint soreness, weakness, stiffness, stabbing pains (in the neck, arms, chest, and abdomen), blood pressure spikes, dry/sore throat, dry eyes, difficulty swallowing. Symptoms are similar to arthritis or other autoimmune diseases. Night sweats continue but are lighter. Weight loss continues but slower. Sleeping remains irregular.

                                                Woke up with abdominal pain on the right side just below the ribs. I have had two other &#34;events&#34; that I assumed were gallbladder attacks but the pain subsided within a few hours. With this event, after a few hours and the pain was still high, I had to be driven to the ER. Just before leaving my house I started getting tunnel vision and my arms and legs went numb. I was able to walk on my own again once reaching the hospital. As of today, 5 days later, I am still in pain. I have taken out all fatty foods and things that are bad for gallbladder issues and still no change.

                                                3 days after I got the 1st dose I started to muscle tightness in both of my upper legs, and buttox. I took a muscle relaxer 10 mg cyclobenzaprine once a day to try and relieve the tightness and pain but did not seem to make any difference. I drive a work truck for a living and I could not even bare to sit down anymore. The pain in my legs got to be so bad that I could not work anymore. On 5-1-2021 both of my upper legs, hips and low back where all &#34;on fire&#34;, extremely painful to walk, could not sit down at all. Both buttox muscles hurt extremely bad when I sat down. Everything was hot to the touch and just had pulsating pain. 10 days after icing and taking ibprohen,  the pulsating pain finally stopped in everything except for my left hip and low back. (But I have had chronic left hip pain and low back pain for awhile bow so that&#39;s just &#34;normal&#34; for me). Another symptom that has started is upper right abdominal cramping and feeling nauseous. Especially when getting up to quickly. I am very nervous about getting my 2nd dose of the Pfizer shot. Which is scheduled for tomorrow in fact.

                                                As a clinical monitor, I was called over to assess a driver slumped over in his seat. He had just received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine approximately 10 minutes earlier. The passenger (his fiance) said he was acting normal until she heard him grunt and then realized that he was passed out.   While attempting to lay flat, I performed a jaw thrust that yielded a stridulous inspiration but was still unresponsive. He did not have a palpable carotid pulse. Paramedics was summoned emergently. Within 30-45 seconds, he awoke but was confused and amnestic to the event. He had no physical complaints and no significant medical or allergy history.   I auscultated his larynx (no stridor) and his lungs (CTA). His initial vitals: BP 90/51  HR 61  VR 16  SaO2 100% An electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm without ischemic changes or evidence of conduction delay. His glucose was 119.   Over the next 30 minutes, he was able to drink two bottles of water and some orange juice. That said, he still said he &#34;felt off.&#34; Repeat vital signs:  BP 118/62  HR 69  SaO2 100%.    The medics advised him to follow up with his doctor, preferably today. His fiance agreed to drive him to an ED near their home for a more thorough evaluation. I provided her my phone number to provide to the ED for any questions.   His clinical syndrome was consistent with a syncopal episode associated with orthostatic hypotension. Low suspicion for anaphylaxis.

A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0176), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 11May2021 13:30 (at the age of 34-year-old) at first, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient did not have other vaccinations within four weeks prior, did not have other vaccinations on the same date. On 13May2021, the patient reported that he started with pain in calves worse on left side then right. It felt like they were sore, like he was working out. But he had just been sitting at his desk and doing nothing. Outcome of the event was not resolved.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                I was getting ready for bed (around 2am, early night for me) and suddenly felt dizzy, nauseous, and incredibly hot. I was very stressed about it and it had been six days since the shot, so I just assumed I was either having a heart attack or a really bad panic attack. I did a meditation and chewed a couple aspirin just in case.  There was extreme tightness in my chest. Breathing was difficult. The dizziness, nausea, and inability to control my body temperature went away within a couple hours and I managed to sleep. But the chest tightness and difficulty breathing persisted for about 3 or 4 days.  I also noticed it hurt more whenever I was sitting upright or forward, and it hurt almost zero when I leaned back or laid down.

                                                16 hours after my second shot, I woke up with some nausea.  I went to the bathroom, did not vomit, however in the middle of urinating I collapsed on the floor, couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t form full sentences, started sweating profusely, had to crawl back to my bed, and my pulse was through the roof.  I almost went to the ER, but the episode subsided within 15 minutes.   When I tried to fall back asleep, it felt like I was blacking out and not drifting asleep.  The next day, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms.  Followed by 4 days of normalcy.  On the 4th day, while working, I experienced a sharp 3 second &#34;electric shock&#34; feeling in my left side of my chest.   On the 5th day, I already had previously scheduled an appointment with my primary for a physical.  I told her about my episode; she took an EKG which yielded normal results.  Lab work also looked ok.  On the 6th day, I started feeling some more nausea and fatigue.  On the 7th day, the vertigo intensified tenfold, and the room was spinning.  That&#39;s when I started experiencing the following symptoms:  ? More nausea. ? Dizzy spells that come and go, especially after eating. ? Persistent periodic electric shock feeling in my left chest.  It?s dull but annoying.  And just when I think it?s gone for good, another 1 second shock happens. ? Left arm is  weak - the entire arm. ? When I try to sleep, the left side of my head feels as though I?m blacking out when I start drifting.  It almost feels like I?m getting anesthesia or something like that.  But just the left side. ? Basically the left side of my body (I got the jab in my left arm) from the waist up just feels off. ? One of my arms is numb when I wake up until I shake it out.  It?s not one particular arm. ? Energy levels are low.  Especially when I wake up and start moving around.  On the 8th day, I went to the ER thinking  perhaps it was a heart attack.  Nothing - EKG was again normal and lab work was normal.  The doctor told me it&#39;s all in my head - anxiety.  However, I&#39;m not anxious and I&#39;m a very level headed individual.    It&#39;s now day 12 and I feel overall awful.  I can&#39;t concentrate on anything.  I&#39;m not thinking clearly and forgetting simple things.  The dull feeling and electric shocks on my left side continue.  I&#39;ve never felt this bad before.  I&#39;m a healthy 34 year old that exercises regularly, has never smoked or done drugs, rarely drinks alcohol, and eats generally very healthy.  If given a second chance I would not take the covid shot.  I am praying this goes away.

I have anxiety and panic attacks, I have the chills in the morning. I?ve seen my PCP who prescribed me mcylzine , and a steroid taper pack ! Didnt really see and or feel any change ! So she referred me to an ENT , and he wants me to take nortriptyline , but I?m very cautious of taking a anti depressant! These events have brought great fear to me! I was perfectly normal before the vaccine! I would run everyday , workout and enjoy life! I haven?t been able to enjoy these things! Currently taking hydroxyzine for anxiety and high vitamin to get the inflammation done!  Must be a inner ear inflammation from the spike protein we think! I cry a lot , cuz I miss my life

A 34-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular in Arm Left on 17May2021 (at the age of 34-years-old) (Lot Number: EW0187) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included higher than normal blood pressure, about 2-3 weeks ago, his blood pressure was very high due to really crazy stress in his life and eating terrible; headaches, smoked marijuana, drunk vodka, sometimes he had a sensitivity to needles, sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, Sometimes he got a little queasy with the sight of needles and just had a ton of dental work done. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (Generic Brand Zyrtec); caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN) taken for headaches. He explained he took Generic Brand Zyrtec which he had been on for years now and he took Excedrin for headaches when he got them. Those were basically the only medications he took really. He hadn&#39;t had any type of vaccine. He previously had a tetanus shot about 10 years ago for Immunization. There was no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine on Monday, 17May2021. Within 3-5 minutes of getting the vaccine, he had a really crazy reaction. He remembered looking at his wife and she told him he was having mild convulsions as he was sitting in the chair in May2021. He was kind of shaking in May2021. He turned ghostly white and he began sweating profusely in May2021. He mentioned that her wife said that he was not conscious for around 5 minutes and was &#34;snoring with eyes open&#34; in May2021. He added that he was &#34;fighting to stay awake&#34; for around 15-20 minutes after that. He blacked out. All he remembers was that he was trying to fight off tunnel vision for a very brief time in May2021. The pharmacist continuously checked on him. The lightheadedness and feeling like he was going to black out lasted 15-20 minutes in May2021. They put him in a chair and told him to elevate his feet, but the caller explains he could not elevate his feet. He had his feet in another chair in front of him. He couldn&#39;t get comfortable, he was sitting down. He was restless, lightheaded. He kept feeling like he was going to pass out. So, then he tried to stand up and walk a little bit. He only made it 5 steps. So, he sat on the ground and laid down. He laid on the ground, flat on his back, and put his feet in a chair, which was about 2.5 feet above him for about 15-20 minutes. He started to feel better. He still felt very tired and weak in May2021 but he was able to stand up and walk and go home. He hadn&#39;t had a reaction since. He had had no other symptoms besides just a sore arm in May2021. He confirmed he recovered completely from his experience when he was administered the vaccine. He came home from the vaccine facility, laid on the couch and watched TV for a couple of hours and then fell asleep for 3-4 hours. He was tired, but he felt completely fine. He had no lightheadedness, no dizziness. He also wanted to add sometimes he has a sensitivity to needles, but he didn&#39;t when he received the COVID vaccine. Sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, but he was actually excited to get the COVID shot. He was even comforting his wife and was telling her everything is going to be okay. He wasn&#39;t worried about the needle with the COVID shot. Sometimes, he gets a little queasy with the sight of needles, but he saw the needle and he didn&#39;t feel faint or angst when getting the shot. He just had a ton of dental work done, where he had huge needles shoved in his mouth and he didn&#39;t feel faint or anything. He really wanted to get the second shot to finish the vaccination series. He did kind of believe he had a reaction, he was not trying to play it off and say &#34;oh I got the vaccine and passed out&#34;. He knew himself and knew what it&#39;s like to faint and this experience just felt different. He believed he had a reaction. He never felt tunnel vision that strong in his entire life, it felt like being punched in the face. Since those 2-3 weeks, his stress load had gone down and he had had a drastic change in his diet, so his blood pressure was reading much better now. This past Monday, 17May2021, when he received his vaccine, his blood pressure shouldn&#39;t have been that high.  The EMT&#39;s did come before he left and because he passed out his blood pressure was low at 100/60. When providing the Lot number off of his vaccine record card, the patient explained the last digit was either a 7 or a 2, he can&#39;t read this person&#39;s handwriting&#34;, however, he eventually confirmed the number was a 7.  The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The outcome of event tired was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovered in May2021.

                                                After receiving my second COVID-19 vaccine, I began feeling feverish and achy about 20 hours after the shot. I left work early to come home and rest. About 34 hours after the shot, I woke up around 2:00 am with intense abdominal and back pain, a fever, and vomiting. I took Tylenol and tried to rest, but my discomfort continued throughout the day. By the afternoon of March 30, I began to worry that I was having more than a typical vaccine reaction. The PA who saw me assessed my symptoms, performed an abdominal exam, and then dismissed my issues as a bad vaccine reaction. He gave me an injection of toradol and sent me home. My symptoms subsided after the toradol injection, but I still felt unwell.   On March 31, I had a previously scheduled visit with my primary care doctor. During the visit, I described my symptoms after receiving the vaccine, but I was told again that I was just having a really bad reaction to the vaccine. Throughout that day, my condition continued to worsen, and by the evening of the 31st I developed a fever and my abdominal pain returned. I scheduled an emergency telemedicine visit. I described my symptoms and described the pain I was feeling, but again, I was told I was having a bad vaccine reaction.   On the morning of April 1, I woke up with a fever and debilitating abdominal pain. I drove myself to the ER where I was diagnosed appendicitis. My appendix was about to rupture, so I was rushed into surgery. I was released after several days but had to return.

This Pharmacist reported for two patients, this is the first of two reports regards to a male patient.  A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular, administered in left arm on 02Jun2021 between 10:00 and 11:00 am, maybe around 10:30ish (Batch/Lot Number: EW0178; Expiration Date: Aug2021, NDC number: 59267100002) as 1ST DOSE 0.3ML, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation at pharmacy. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. A pharmacist from pharmacy had 2 patients who received the vaccine and both had a reaction after the dose, within one hour after receiving the dose, and EMS was called. The pharmacist confirmed the first patient had the reaction within 1 hour of receiving the dose. She clarified this person was having cold sweats, about to black out, had a hard time and trouble swallowing and was turning pale, his pupils were dilated. Pharmacist explained they make them sit there for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine so this reaction happened maybe 3 minutes after he got the shot. The EMS came and he was brought to the hospital. The patient did come back afterwards and he said the doctor didn&#39;t know 100 percent what happened, but it might been a slight allergic reaction, not to the point where he lost consciousness, but they did release him. She clarified they checked his vitals and everything and released him. When pharmacist was probed for the event, the pharmacist thought it was an anaphylactic reaction. The events require a visit to Emergency Room, patient was brought by EMS. Not had a visit to Physician Office. Unknown if patient received treatment, the pharmacist wasn&#39;t be told that much information. The outcome of events was unknown. Causality: In this case, pharmacist did not think so. She thinks maybe it was anxiety but she wouldn&#39;t know.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, a possible causal association between the events and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis; Slurring his speech; Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 35-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in deltoid (unknown if right or left) on 17Dec2020 at 30 ug, single for &#39;Preventative&#39;. Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications.(Physician) He is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. States what is going on with the patient may be associated as a side effect. The patient got the vaccine two to three weeks ago, he clarifies the patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and the patient ended up acutely developing (states it is a presumptive diagnosis) Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, states it looks like a radiologic diagnosis. The patient is an employee at hospital. When querying seriousness states it is medically significant but could be disabling but he thinks the patient will recover. Reporter seriousness for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Medically significant, Hospitalization. Patient was hospitalized on Sunday and he is still admitted at this time. Dates when patient was in hospital for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from 03Jan2021 to ongoing. Caller thinks the patient was flown to (Place) yesterday. The patient&#39;s mother asked the caller if the caller thought the acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from the vaccine and the caller responded that he did not think it was from the vaccine. He confirms the patient is still admitted in the hospital and the patient&#39;s attending neurologist is doctor. The caller heard about the patient from doctor. When querying covid vaccine dose, the caller states the standard dose is 30 mcg. This was clarified and documented as provided. The patient has not received his second dose yet. He asks if the patient should receive the second dose. He asks a general question if a pregnant patient can be given the Pfizer covid vaccine. He heard the patient had a stroke then the CFO tried to talk to him and the patient was slurring his speech. Caller spoke to the patient&#39;s mother this morning and caller told the mother that he would try to find out what is going on with the patient.  He asked that the patient get an HIV test even though he does not think the patient is at risk. Vaccination facility type was Hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility was No. None additional vaccines administered on same date of the PFIZER suspect. AE acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require a visit to Emergency Room, not visit to physician office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. He has heard of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis being associated with vaccines in the past and states that it is rare and usually in kids. States he saw patients that may have had acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis back in the 80s and 90s. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Patient will get steroids tonight pending the review of the x-ray). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke with speech slurred, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (looks like a radiologic diagnosis by the reporting physician), was most likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 2 hours after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine I felt a warm, flushed feeling in my left foot, not unlike stepping in a bucket of warm water. The sensation lasted about 5 seconds and disappeared on its own. Since then, about once per hour I have had the same symptom, with a warm, flushed feeling in my left foot. There is no pain, slight numbness and tingling, but no loss of function or coordination. I can sense that the symptom is about to begin approximately 10 seconds before it starts, because my foot begins to feel swollen. This has occurred about 40-50 times since the injection, and has only gone down slightly in frequency over the past 72 hours, currently it is happening about once every 1.5-2 hours.

                                                After about 20 minutes, I noticed some mild numbness in the face, similar to getting a light dose of Novocain at the dentist. It stated to go away, but never fully dissipated. The next morning while getting ready for work, I noticed I could not taste anything, and mouth felt a bit numb. Also had some residual facial numbness.

Took 650 mg tabs of  acetaminophen throughout the day per bottle instruction.  Extreme fatigue Saturday night and severe headaches, fever at 100.2 F that night, treated with acetaminophen. By Sunday night temperature was 100.9 F, extreme fatigue and severe headaches and painful eye balls, heart rate racing up to 120 BPM when moving from bathroom to living room. Went back down to 65 BPM after about 1min at rest. Tried massages of upper body to loosen muscle, seemed to help with bodyache. Spent Saturday through Tuesday at home. Rapid covid 19 test negative.

Felt as I was going to pass out. Made it to bathroom as I thought I was going to vomit. Essentially collapsed on floor and had severe rigors/uncontrollable shaking throughout entire body for 30 minutes. Felt as I was being electrocuted, it was extremely intense and could feel it through every part of my body. Teeth were clenched entire time and could barely open mouth. Attempted to get up multiple times but could not make it past getting on my knees. Laid on floor  until shaking eventually subsided. Had severe headache after (i assume it was from clenching teeth for 30 min). Extreme fatigue.  Was sent to ER per policy for covid test - results negative. Sent home from work per policy. Slept remainder of day. Woke up @ 5 pm feeling substantially better.

Took OTC acetaminophen and NDAIDs. Visited employees health who sent me to urgent care for neurological exam. Urgent care physician noted right arm weaker than left and recorded report of bilateral upper extremity paresthesia. Recommended follow up exam and cervical MRI if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 7 days. Neck pain has improved but still present. Paresthesias still present. Right arm (dominant arm) still weaker than left. Will follow up with primary care physician this week if symptoms continue.  Additional side effects: headache, dizziness, nausea, shivers, fatigue, joint pain (all resolved within 72 hours).

                                                Severe abdominal pain.  The shot was given at approx 11 am.  Abdominal pain started around 6 pm, gradually got worse.  At 1 am I was awoken in pain and I took hydrocodone leftover from a previous surgery in hopes of making it to the morning for urgent care.  (ER Bills)  At 4 am I was re-awoken in even worse pain, decided I was about to die, and went to the ER.  Cold sweat on way to ER.  Throat dry.  Made it to ER, received Morphine, the first dose calmed the pain down, did not make it go away.  A lot of tests and several hours later, a second dose was given when the pain returned to its terrible state.  Approx 15 min into the second dose pain was finally subsiding (roughly 1 or 2 pm).  Went home and took Tylonal as requested by Docs and filled an Oxy prescription in anticipation of the return of the pain.  This has not happened.  Slept great last night.  Dry Mouth Persists.  Also slight arm tenderness.

There were a few moments during the first half hour of receiving the shot that I thought I might pass out. When the nurse took my blood pressure it was 184/81, which is not normal for me. It took about an hour for it to get back down to a normal level. Afterwards, I felt very jittery for a while.

A 35-year-old male patient (age at vaccination 35-years-old) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced sore arm on an unspecified date. At the time of the report, the patient recovered from the event on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event.

Possibly some worsening exercise tolerance ~3-4 weeks after initial onset date. I&#39;m not sure if it was deconditioning vs lingering covid effects.   No side effects from first covid vaccine minus a sore arm. After second dose some mild fatigue ~2 days. Then 12 days after second dose significant more fatigue and in the next few days chills at night and tachycardia with pulse in 120s at rest. No fever, pain, sob, swelling or other symptoms. Presented to immediate care on 2/27 predominantly for the tachycardia. Was referred to the ED.  Discharged on 3/1 on metoprolol with possible diagnosis of viral myocarditis.

                                                One hour after the injection, my brain began to feel hazy. My short-term memory was terrible. Remembering simple tasks was very difficult. The best way I can describe it is that it felt like I had consumed marijuana. I do not use marijuana or any other drugs. I had not consumed alcohol. The effects were similar to that of marijuana in that there was a ?peak? and a ?come-down.?  The peak lasted a little more than one hour, and began about one hour after the injection. The effects slowly faded until I didn?t feel completely normal until I woke up this morning. Today, I have no symptoms other than a sore arm.

This started about 90 minutes after vaccination. It originated at the injection site and moved down the arm into the left hand. At 120 minutes after injection it moved into the neck, face, ear and scalp - again only on the left side. The following day numbness and tingling sensation is about half as strong. At times it fades and but comes back. Muscle movements were not impacted and sense of touch remained. As of 30 hours after the injection I have not sought out treatment.

                                                One day after receiving my second vaccine, I started to get a tingling feeling on my nose and left cheek, near my sinuses. It would occasionally lightly burn. This persisted for a couple of days, then slightly improved. It never completely went away, and in the past day I have noticed it moving more to my head where I am having migraine like headaches behind my left eye.

RPh ran outside to attend to patient. Pt&#39;s eyes were rolled back and looked very pale. RPh asked staff to call 911 while attending to patient. Patient came to after about 30 seconds- 1 minute and was scared and confused. RPh calmed him down and took his BP. BP and HR was normal. Paramedics arrived shortly after and retook patient&#39;s vitals and made sure he was ok before leaving. There were no signs of anaphylaxis and paramedics think it was anxiety- related. Advised patient to have 2nd dose ok&#39;d by MD and if yes, get it at a clinical setting.

This 35-year-old male consumer (patient) reported for himself.  A 35-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: ER8729) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 08Apr2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.

This 35- year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration, on 12Apr2021 at 09:30 am (at the age of 35-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, in left arm. The facility where COVID-19 vaccine was administered was a hospital. No known allergies. Patient has no relevant medical history. States: I live a healthy lifestyle diet, exercise, proper rest. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 12Apr2021 10:00 am, the patient stated: I passed out and or blacked out on my drive home from the hospital. I was careful to follow the 15minute wait period before I left the hospital and was ok at that point. I had tense nerve feelings came over me as it grew so strong, I was forced to try and get my car on an off ramp to leave the highway I was on. I thankfully did not get any real injuries to my body as I spun and landed on the side of the road in the grass area. However, this experience was horrifying to say the least. I had a delayed reaction to this vaccine, other than this one incident, I really only had the typical body aches or pain for 24 hours and a bit of nerve twitching. I will not mark this as a risk of death, because it was my driving a car that risked my safety not the vaccine, however, the vaccine did cause the black out. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination.  Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

Patient briefly convulsed and passed out post vaccination. Reaction was immediately and woke up a few seconds shortly after his name was called a couple times by the vaccinator. Patient admitted that he was very nervous and scared of needle, but denied ever experience fainting and convulsing. Patient was instructed to sit in the pharmacy for 30 minutes for observation. He rejected our offer to call EMT/Paramedics and for someone else to pick him up instead of driving himself. Patient received 4 cups of water from pharmacy. When he left at 30 minute mark, he was stable.

                                                After 2nd dose of COVID19 vaccine (taken 3 weeks after first dose) I had a feeling of a mild fever/chills and low energy and body aches about 12 hours after the injection. However I also begin getting a lot of pain and tightness around my right rib cage intercostal muscle area and lower back (QL area to Lats). This made it harder to breath and hurt while I laid down to sleep. It also hurt to take a deep breath/cough/laugh etc. This lasted until Thursday night (4/29/21) when the same kind of pain moved over to my left side. The past 2 days it has become quite intense though making it impossible to sleep on my back last night (I had to sit upright to avoid intense pain) and painful to even walk. It still hurts in my left rib cage at rest (feels more like a dull ache and stiff), but intensifies if I try to expand my lungs with breathing or lie down or move in any way. Mainly intercostal area around the rib cage and the back around my lung. Thought I might have to go to the emergency room last night it was so bad.

                                                Patient told me that he gets dizzy after immunizations. I told him that I would keep him seated after until he felt ok, his wife was with him and I told her that if he started feeling bad to let me know as I went back into the pharmacy.  About 5 minutes after his immunization he said he didn&#39;t feel well.  I went out to check on him he said he was hot  and then he lost consciousness.  His wife and I were not able to wake him,  911 was called and  I grabbed the Epipen 0.3mg and gave him 1 dose in the left thigh.  Shortly after he started to respond.  Once awake he began vomiting and still complained of being very hot.  His wife splashed water on his face and we kept talking to him until EMS arrived about 5 minutes after the Call.  EMS  checked him out, he refused to go to the hospital and refused them to take him to his car when he felt better.  He walked out on his own after about another 20 minutes with his wife.  I called to check on his around 4pm and he said that he was feeling ok.

                                                My condition rapidly went down the hill right before bed time. I woke up because of me screaming my wife&#39;s name. I tried to get to my phone but my hands were out control for roughly 10 seconds - i never experienced such thing in my life (i will try to describe it - i could move them around shoulder but the rest looked like tentacles - no control over fingers too) . Around 5 seconds into trying to grab my phone i was completely awoken and realized that i covered in cold sweat, my heart rate is extremely high (when i returned control over my limbs i checked and it was &gt;120, when i sleep i usually have around 45). Based on my smart watches my heart rate went all the way up to 160 at the moment when i woke up.   Heart rate went down to ~80 and after 20-30 minutes or measuring everything possible (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level, etc) we decided not to call 911. The rest of the night was ok&#39;ish - in AM i checked smartwatch data and my average heart rate was 60 which is 10-15 above normal. Next morning welcomed me with moderate fever (37.5C), joints pain (also never experienced at such scale - literally entire body), headache and bunch of other annoying things (including one impacting vision - until lunch time everything had higher contrast).  Two days after i completely recovered.

                                                Symptoms started approximately 14 hours post-vaccination.  Day 1 symptoms:   - Fever (&lt;= 101.0 degrees F)   - Chills   - Headache   - Fatigue/tiredness   - Vomiting (one time exactly 24 hours post onset of symptoms)  Days 2 - 5 symptoms:   - Severe pain/tightness and fatigue feeling in both arms, shoulder blades, and chest.  This has slowly improved over days 2 through 5.   - Nausea associated with the pain/tightness noted above   - Coughing (no phlegm)   - Vomiting (one more time on day 2 exactly 24 hours after the first vomiting episode)   - Fever and chills (both resolved by days 2-3)  Treatments:   - 500 mg Tylenol was used to treat fever and pain during the first several days.  Fever was well controlled, but pain was only partially controlled   - On days 3&#43; Advil was used for pain relief and it was effective   - Alka Seltzer Gold was used to treat nausea as necessary.  It was not particularly effective as the nausea seemed linked to the severity of the pain.  When the pain eased, the nausea did as well.   Outcomes:   - Symptoms have slowly improved over the 5 days post 2nd dose vaccination.  Advil has been discontinued since the afternoon of day 4.  No fever is present and the pain is now only mild.

Blurred vision.  Dizziness. Lasted for about 10 minutes. Started 5 minutes after shot. Reported it to nurses after symptoms subsided. They gave me some water and I stuck around to be monitored.

                                                According to my wife, 10 minutes post shot I had what appeared to be a mild seizure and lost consciousness for 1-2 minutes. Prior to that happening, I told her I felt light headed. She notified personnel while we were in the 15 min wait holding area and when I regained consciousness two EMTs were checking me out. They took my vitals, asked me questions and had me get out of the car and walk around. I was monitored for several minutes. It was recommended I visit a hospital or urgent care if I continued to feel unwell. My wife &amp; I left the vaccine site and decided on the way home to go to the hospital just to ensure everything was all right. We went back home for about 30-60 minutes. During this time my heart rate continued to remain elevated and it felt like I had adrenaline coursing through my system. I attributed the feeling to recovering from passing out, but it did not dissipate.  Upon arrival to the ER I began having trouble trying to breathe and chest pain. During the triage EKG it was discovered I was experiencing atrial fibrillation. I was given treatment, fluids and monitored for several hours before being released. Estimated time from receiving shot to being diagnosed with afib was approximately 2.5-3 hours.

                                                The day of my first dose (January 23) I felt a bit numb in the head but thought it would be okay. That did clear up.  I was however very weak after the first dose but improved.  By February 7, I had been feeling pulsations in my head and I checked that I had a BP over 200/100 and went to the ER. I was given a low dose amplodipine however my primary care doctor checked my urine and found very high proteinuria. Eventually I followed up with a nephrologist after being given an urgent referral and was diagnosed with membrane nephropathy due to high PLA2R levels. My proteinuria was 13 g/day (severe) and I had very high cholesterol and low serum albumin (2.5 mg/dl).  He mentioned that the vaccine has unmasked it in several people.  I have received treatment of 10 mg Lisinopril, 20 mg Simvastatin, 81 mg aspirin and have received my first infusion of 1 g Rituximab and will follow with a second infusion 2 weeks later.

                                                started as severe dizziness and weakness, chest pain was hospitalized once I got to the ER because my heart was not working properly, after many test the found my heart was in heart failure with an output of 35% only, was in hospital for 5 days. Doctors couldn&#39;t see what caused such a sudden weakness of the heart, they did cardio path and arteries have zero blockage, they did ECO, and a EP Study. My heart now suffers from PVCs or arrhythmia and they are very irregular and frequent. Was given medicine to help the heart and control the PVCs, and discharged with wearing a safety vest, to follow up with the cardio doctors. Followed up with doctors and they have done an MRI which shows scarring of the heart. The doctor has determined that the diagnosis is myocardiatis. There is no proof this direct relation with the vaccine,  however symptoms started soon after the vaccine in a healthy young man. Now I still have to go to another electrophysiologist to see what he can do to help alleviate the PVCs and continue to take the medication to see of the heart can improve. I could not work for a month, and still cannot resume normal activities because my heart is to weak to sustain it.

A 35-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 21Jan2021 12:00 (at 35 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing food allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  After receiving the Covid Vaccine on 21Jan2021, the caller has experienced a lot of adverse side effects that he&#39;s dealing with now almost 3 and a half months later. He has seen numerous doctors as well as specialists. He has a long list of symptoms that occurred at onset. What he is dealing with now is a swollen neck (onset date 21Jan2021), a sore throat (onset date 21Jan2021), tongue discoloration, and just general fatigue (onset date 21Jan2021) and malaise (onset date 21Jan2021). Prior to the shot he was physically healthy. He was running about 20 miles a week. Then he got the shot and his health declined significantly and he is still recovering. When this occurred, caller weighed 165 pounds, and now he weighs 145 pounds. He lost 20 pounds. These events happened after the first dose of the vaccine. He got his vaccine at around noon on 21Jan2021, and by that evening at around 2000 he had a tightness in his throat, felt like his right ear was plugged up, then had pain on the right side of his neck. It all coincided with the same side as the vaccine, which he had in his right arm. He also experienced some pretty severe chills. His throat still feels swollen, probably because of his swollen lymph nodes. Some days it is better and some days it is worse. It is causing constant pressure on his neck. He is not sure if he noticed the swollen lymph nodes the same day as the shot or shortly after.Patient does not currently have neck pain. He should probably mention it started probably a few weeks after the onset of his symptoms. He does not know when it went away. He was getting swollen lymph nodes on his left side as well, and his throat became sore on the left side as well. It went away maybe a few weeks ago. He is not sure when the swollen lymph nodes or the sore throat started. His right ear was plugged and then it affected his left ear and it got plugged up as well. It was to the point where he could barely hear. It was almost like an ear infection when it is completely plugged and there is pressure behind the ear drum. 2 weeks after his right side it started on the left side. It has subsided by this time, but it has not completely gone away, but it is not as bad. Patietnt had the chills for 3 weeks, but they weren&#39;t as severe as the first night. He was just freezing cold and could not get warm. After that night he was still having issues feeling warm and had to keep his bedroom at like 80 degrees constantly. It probably continued for about a month. He doesn&#39;t have chills now, however it evolved into more of a heat intolerance. Whenever he feels to warm he feels more tired and not well overall. It is really odd. It is more heat intolerance he feels is going on. After the first few months it started then he had the opposite. He had a problem getting warm, then after the first month he didn&#39;t tolerate heat too well. He is not sure when the tongue discoloration first started, but he noticed it about a month and a half ago. The general fatigue and malaise started at the beginning with everything else. He did not have the second dose of the vaccine. Caller believes the doctors ran a CBC. He had a complete panel done a few times and nothing concerning presented or stood out to the doctors. They did an ultrasound on the left side of his abdomen to make sure he had no spleen enlargement, and that came back normal. They ran thyroid panels and those came back normal. One thing that came back abnormal that explains more of this but the timing is odd with the vaccine is he came back positive for Mono. He started seeing an ENT specialist, and he believes that getting the vaccine could have caused his immune system to freak out considering his history with allergies. It could have caused the Epstein Mono virus already present to become reactivated. That was kind of his theory on why this could have occurred. All the events caused a visit to Emergency Room. He went to the ER about a week, exactly a week after he had the vaccine that day. He was having trouble swallowing (onset date 28Jan2021) as well as his breathing was becoming a concern (onset date 28Jan2021) for him. He also was just having what felt like anxiety-like symptoms (onset date 28Jan2021), and he has no history of anxiety. If he got the vaccine on 21Jan2021 then this happened around 28Jan2021. He did have another ER visit about a week after that one as well. He started to have severe symptoms similar to the first time he went. He is still having a little bit of an issue swallowing. He attributes that to the swelling in his lymph nodes and neck possibly affecting that. His breathing he does not have problems with so much now. He has more of a constant discomfort in his neck, though it is not affecting his breathing at this point. As far as general anxiety he still has that and it does cause issues. It is causing him to not sleep as a result. His swallowing is better. His breathing was the most severe of the symptoms. Maybe after the first month it began to become less of an issue. He couldn&#39;t say exactly when it went away. It probably went away as a result of the swelling subsiding. To be honest he is not sure. Doctors put the caller on numerous medications as well as a medicine that he continued with. He doesn&#39;t know if his anxiety is better as a result of the medicine helping or if it would be the same if he went off of it. He is not sure. He has had trouble sleeping since this all began. It has been a little better. It could be a result of the medicine that helped. He is really unsure if he was not on the medicine how it would be. Patient visited a Physician Office for all events.No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the events Throat tightness,Sensation of block in ear,Swallowing difficult,Anxiety, Sleep difficult,Hearing reduced was recovering; chills,Swollen lymph nodes,Neck pain,Sore throat was recovered; Tongue discoloration, heat intolerance,Fatigue,Malaise was not recovered; other events was unknown.

                                                Patient had fainted after receiving the vaccine and when I came to saw him, he was back on the chair. He said he felt faint. I asked if his breathing was alright, his sight and hearing was ok; he said everything was fine, but he still felt faint. Then I saw his eyes closing again and he slouched down on the chair and became unconscious. I helped him onto the ground, where he started shaking, so I rolled him onto his side. He felt clammy. It was a few seconds before he stopped shaking and opened his eyes again. I asked him to stay laying on the ground and asked him again regarding his breathing, hear rate, vision, how he felt. He asked if he passed out again and I told him yes and we&#39;re going to keep him on the ground until paramedics arrive. He said he felt better; his breathing and speech was fine, there wasn&#39;t any sound of shortness of breath, but he was sweating in cold sweats and he asked us to fan him. He said that he felt better and that he has a big phobia of needles, which his wife who was there, confirmed. He informed me that he&#39;s fainted several times at doctor&#39;s office and hospitals when they stick a needle in him. When the fire fighters arrived, they spoke to him prepared to get a EKG on him, to which he immediately told them that he doesn&#39;t want them to stick any needles in him and he became frightened that the EKG pads were needles. When paramedics came, they determined that they had to take him to the hospital because they said he wasn&#39;t able to stand up on his own without falling over and his heart rate was increasing.

                                                A few hours after receiving my first dose, the tips of my fingers suddenly felt like they were being electrocuted (like touching a battery terminal), and my hands, part of my arms, and the lower portion of my face went numb and tingly. This subsided after about 20 mins, with some lingering numbness. Since then this has happened to me every single day (often multiple times, though sometimes only once or twice per day), and lasts from a few minutes to sometimes six hours. I went to an urgent care, and an after-hours clinic here in town to have this looked at, but I am working class, so too poor to be able to see a doctor regularly (or often at all) so I have no primary care physician.  This still goes on in varying degrees every day.  I am concerned this is permanent damage, and I cannot use my hands very well at all at my job when it is happening.

EKG revealed anterior and inferior STE and he was taken directly to cardio lab for emergent coronary angiography, where he was found to have total thrombotic occlusion of midLAD, treated with drug-eluting stents.

                                                1st dose: within 7 minutes hot feeling throughout the body, racing hear rate up to 157 and BP 180/107. Monitored at the site with an oxymeter and bp monitor. Eventually it went back to normal and I was able to leave. The event of my heart BP and pulse rising happened multiple times during that day. Called my doctor after.  2nd dose: same event as first dose, but this time it came on almost immediately after the shot was completed. Elevated BP and heart rate. I was not getting better so I was wheeled in to the hospital where I had some testing done and released maybe 5 hours later. All heart tests were normal.   Within about a week of the 2nd dose I was at home relaxing and my heart rate went up to 150 and then back down to 59 and then back up again. I had an oxymeter on that was monitoring it and it kept fluctuating between 59-150 and I could feel it rise and drop. I was admitted to the ER then discharged. I was told it was a possible vaccine side effect. Cardiologist appointment a few weeks later where again I was told it may have been related.  Since the vaccine I have recurring episodes as detailed above. Racing heart, headaches etc.

I sat down to try to catch my breath and decided to put my heart rate monitor on (I use it when I run). My heart rate would dip into the 40s when I normally have a resting heart rate in the mid 60s.  After 30 minutes of sitting and the symptoms getting progressively worse, I decided to go to the emergency room. On the way over I started feeling weak and increasingly short of breath.  These symptoms lasted for approximately 8 hours. Since the episode I have noticed periodic episodes of shortness of breath and chest fluttering.

He lost consciousness but was making snorting/snoring noises and was having muscle contractions that left him rolling around in his chair. This lasted about 2 minutes. He then turned very red and it appeared that he wasn&#39;t breathing. I removed his facemask and yelled his name/patted his chest and he began to regain consciousness. He sat for several minutes and said he felt fine.

I woke up today, 01/12/2021 and had pain and swelling in my right arm pit. I went to my employer&#39;s employee health services and was checked out by a provider. I was told that he didn&#39;t see anything, and he minimized my symptoms. He didn&#39;t seem like he wanted to evaluate me from the time he walked in the exam room. He told me &#34;what do you want us to do? It looks normal.&#34; He then went on to tell them he&#39;s not going to give me time off for work aside from today. I did not ask for any time off once during the evaluation. I recheck my arm pit when I got home, and noticed the swelling is approx. 3&#34;x 3&#34;s. It was not hard to see when I rechecked. I have noticeable pain the swollen area as well. The swelling is visible when I extend my right arm all the way up above my head. I attempted to tell the employee health provider this, but he preferred to check in a manner that does not show the swelling. I am slightly muscular and when my arm is down, you can only feel soft tissue. Employee health gave me Ibuprofen to treat my Sx&#39;s.  I called my primary physician&#39;s office and am waiting for a call back to be either scheduled for an evaluation or receive medical advice.

I am a physician who likely had contracted COVID in 04/2020 and has been suffering long COVID sx since. No significant reaction to dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine other than sore arm. 2nd dose within 12 hours had severe rigors, severe chills, then fever to 39.6 the first night (took 1 dose of tylenol and 1 of advil after), temp of 38-39 the next 12 hours, and then the 2nd night had a fever high of 41.4 degrees (took another tylenol). Had sweats the entire night after and defervesced after. Day 3-5 mostly involve myalgia, nausea, anorexia, malaise, chills, HA, and mild SOB. Took about 1 week to &#34;recover&#34; to my long COVID baseline after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Still having a bit worse SOB now compared to prior to 2nd dose but unsure if it has to do with the vaccine at this point. Had tested for positive anti-spike protein ab (likely from the 1st dose) the morning of my 2nd dose of vaccine.

Accompanied by a painful headache as well as nausea. Headache for most of the day with varying pain severity. Nausea for about two and a half days on and off which is unusual for me to be nauseated.

Began to feel flu like symptoms approx 1800 on the evening of 1/19/21. Symptoms worsened through the night rapidly, beginning with uncontrollable chills/shivering, body aches, restless, slight vertigo, weakness/fatigue. At approx 0100 the morning of 1/20/21, blacked out while in the bathroom of which awoken and found myself disoriented, weak, and on the ground (no injuries noted as i must have eased myself down).  I was able to hydrate afterwards and tolerate eating some dry cereal to help with the weakness. Symptoms began to dissipate while an intense headache continued throughout the night and even through the daytime. The time is now 1020 on the day of 1/20/21 and i still have quite the headache but all other symptoms seem to be relieved at this time.

                                                facial numbing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 36-year-old male patient received his first single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly at 10:45 13Jan2021 at left arm for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no known allergies and had no medical history or concomitant medications. Approximately 20 minutes after administration of the vaccine (13:15PM), the patient began to experience facial numbing, the feeling as similar to the return of sensation after having a numbing agent (at the dentist, for instance). He was more aware than usual of an effort required to move his face. It was not unpleasant, apart from being concerning- He did not know when or if this symptom might pass. Within 90 minutes of onset the sensation was 90% resolved. There was minor sensation with smiling until awakening the next day (approximately 19 hours after administration). No treatment was received for the event. The patient had no Covid-19 before vaccination and had not tested for it. The event resolved at the time of reporting (unspecified date in Jan2021).

                                                Adverse event: 2 of 7 people received a more concentrated dose of the vaccine. One vial of two was diluted incorrectly with less Normal Saline than require. This error was not noticed until person mixing vaccine said they were out of vaccine and did not have enough to get 5 dosages of 0.3ml. Two people mixed one vial of vaccine together demonstrating to the other. It appears the person making the error did not notice they did not have 1.8ml of NS but must have had some air and did not realize it. The error was noticed when all the vaccines were given and one person had not completed pulling up the vaccine. So, 2 of 7 patients received the incorrect dose of vaccine and it could not be determined which two received the incorrect dose. Patient Reports: Sore arm for several days

A 36-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), lot number=EL3247, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm,  on 22Jan2021 at 08:45 (at the age of 36 years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination was administered at a doctors office/urgent care. The patient did not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Medical history was not reported.  Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE) received within 2 weeks of vaccination.  On 23Jan2021 at 0800, the patient experienced swelling of forearm by 60%, and muscle spasms in pectoral muscle. The patient was not hospitalized for the event nor received treatment. The clinical outcome of the events was not recovered. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                48 hrs after receiving first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine I started to feel tension type headaches that were moderate but sometimes can be severe and disabling. These headaches persist daily since the first dose of the vaccine. I still have them today. Duration has been almost two months. No other associated neurologic symptoms at this moment. I dont have any past medical history and never had issues with headaches before. Contacted neurologyst with specialty in headaches for treatment. Labs and MRI without contrast are within normal limits.  I used a series of NSAIDS to see if it helped the pain without success. Also did the Botox treatment, which improved headaches but didnt resolve symptoms.

                                                Was administered the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in our drive-thru clinic on 3/4/21 at approximately 2:15pm. Was in the driver&#39;s seat of his SUV with his father in the passenger seat. Nothing in the PQCF gave us any reason to be concerned over this particular administration. After administration, was asked to pull forward and park in a spot on the right in order to sit for his required 15 minutes post-administration. became unresponsive as he was attempting to park and continue to turn the wheel causing him to drive in a U shape into a rock covered median. The SUV was able to clear the median and the car stopped at the APEX. When I saw the car heading towards the median, I started to head toward the site safely. I approached the car slowly asking him to stop. When I did not receive a response, I knew something was wrong. Once I felt the car was safe to approach, I ran to assist the patient. The patient was barely able to communicate but did say he was dizzy.  15 seconds later he was unable to communicate, I called a second pharmacist  to run over with an epi pen just in case (this was NOT administered). I immediately called 911 at 2:21 pm. reached into the vehicle and got the vehicle into park, while I assessed his airway, breathing, and pulse from a seated position. The patient began to seize. I continued to hold the patient from outside of the vehicle to maintain the patient&#39;s airway and keep him from hurting himself on the steering wheel. The patient regained consciousness approximately 3 minutes later with no memory of what happened. EMS arrived on scene about 2 minutes after he regained the ability to communicate. While EMS assessed the patient, and I reached out to  and division one store management per SOP. EMS determined that the patient had a seizure and was able to go home if they wanted. The father moved into the driver seat. We monitored the patient for 30 minutes and allowed them to leave. We followed up with the patient via phone 2 hours later with no concerns noted. No property damage or bodily harm occurred during this incident. If we are given approval to vaccinate this patient with a second dose, we will arrange for this patient to be taken care of in the pharmacy.

Then as he was walking to schedule his second appointment soon after the vaccine, he fell to his knees (no CHI).  I was notified and ran over to see pt was disoriented, pale, diaphoretic.  While measuring his left arm BP (80/30), he began to convulse with both elbows flexed.  The convulsions lasted about 10 secs, pt did not recall the event, we held him in a seated position on the floor.  He felt much better after the convulsion &#43; water/snacks, however we did call EMS during the event.  Per EMS, BP was 128/80, and pt was AAOx3.  Pt refused to go to the hospital and agreed to f/up with PCP.

Brought to emergency room where I was put on an IV and had blood test to show that my CK levels where at 7357 (normal range is 24-200).

Also developed a slight chills feeling.  At the 21 hour mark, I was exhausted. Felt very weak and stared feeling a little warm. Around hour 22/23, body/bone aches developed.  By 24hrs after the 2nd vaccine, I took 800mg of ibuprofen (to help with the body aches and slight fever) and a Zyrtec for my allergies.  I&#39;m awake and getting ready for work again (I worked through the symptoms yesterday, somehow) approx 34hrs after the 2nd dose. I feel &#34;normal&#34; considering my arm is still sore from the shot. But all other symptoms appear to have subsided; my only tiredness is from waking up early for work.

                                                Mild headache approx 4 hours after injection.  When waking to alarm at 0600 on 25Mar21, noticed that bed was wet from sweating.  Foread was hot to the touch, ague, severe headache, light and noise sensitivity.  The room was cold, I turned up the heat in the house and put on sweatpants, socks, thermal shirt, hoodie, and beanie and could not get warm.  Began drinking water (1.5 gal by end of day at 2300).   No appetite for the entire day, nausea set on after eating a bowl of oatmeal around 1030.  Had several episodes of dry heaving, but no vomiting after eating.  Ate again at around 1900 - chicken broth and a peanut butter sandwich, nausea set on at around 1945, dry heaving, but no vomiting.  Spoke with PCM on symptoms and continued to monitor.  On 26 Mar21, cold sensation had abated, continued drinking water.  Headache, light sensitivity, nausea, and body aches for the entire day, headache has remaind constant - 6 out of 10.  Nausea at a 4.  Body Aches varied between 4-7.  Around 1100, I noticed that my neck had stiffened and it felt as if I had a tension headache.  I used a theracane, heat, and an ice pack to try and relieve the tension with no success.  I have tried relaxation techniques learned from VA to manage pain with no success.  As of 2146, stiffness is around a 6, headache is a 7, body aches 3, nausea while sitting 1, while walking 4.

                                                Onset began with a flushing/warmth feeling in the right side of face about 35 minutes after injection, with itching on the roof of the mouth accompanied by feeling of swelling in the area. This was followed by a spread of the flush/warm feeling across the face, chest and arms followed immediately by a 2-3 minute panic feeling, chest tightness and extremely heightened anxiety with a general feeling of being unable to focus/concentrate. After this couple of minutes the flushing stopped in all areas except the cheeks and the itching sensation dissipated quickly over the next 30 minutes but the feeling of swelling on the roof of the mouth continued for a total of one hour. There were no visible signs of swelling in the mouth, tongue or throat, nor redness in the face. The flushing feeling settled in both cheeks of the face and was accompanied by heightened anxiety, along with an overall feeling of being warm. However, there were no visible signs of redness or rash, the sensations and anxiety persisted for mildly for 10 hours, all of which gradually dissipating over time. That night physical symptoms had cleared up, soreness in the right arm began and lasted into the morning. Anxiety levels mostly returned to normal in the morning.

EMS was called and he had another seizure for them before they could transport him to the hospital.  He also had a fever38.6.

                                                At first I just started to feel a little nausea and some dizziness.  Later my face and top of my head and upper chest flushed some and had a  headache, the headache went away on it&#39;s own relatively quickly.   The next day I felt a little rough, but I have read that the second dose has much higher side effects, and since I have a blood issue, it&#39;s concerning.

                                                I was unable to sleep and began to feel significantly overheated by 10 or 11pm the night of my vaccination. To give a sense of the extent of the disturbance, I ended up standing outside for 10 minutes without shoes or socks in the cold night air (~45°F) to cool off, but remained shiftless the rest of the night and was unable to remain asleep for a full sleep cycle until early morning (4 or 5am). I did not take my temperature at any point but did not appear to have a significantly warm forehead. The next morning I woke up with a very sore left shoulder and arm (i.e. the site of my vaccination) and general muscular stiffness in my back. Raising my arm increases the soreness significantly. I have no concerns about my reactions, but they were significant for a first Pfizer COVID shot so I am reporting to provide information to VAERS.

Symptoms gradually intensified throughout the day. I started to feel generally fatigued a couple hours following injection. Approximately eight to ten hours post-injection, injection site had fair pain to the touch, but no redness or other discoloration was noted. Moderate soreness in the left arm. I felt very fatigued. No pain medication was taken, I just slept for approximately nine hours. When I woke up before 0700, the arm soreness and pain at the injection site had lessened to mild soreness and minor to light pain at the injection site, but I still felt fatigued. I decided to power through and go to work, and the fatigue had subsided in hours. No further issues.

                                                This patient was vaccinated with the  vaccine at approx 1530, in the left arm. He was sitting in the observation area for his allotted 15 minutes. At approx 1540 this nurse was called over by a staff member and was told that this patient was feeling dizzy, hot and nauseous. This patient presented as diaphoretic and pale.  RN&#39;s, came over to the patient and began asking basic demographic info questions, and started to measure his vital signs. This patient denied any heart issues or past medical history. His father was present and was seated next to the patient. We had the patient move onto a cot and we had the patient lay down and we elevated his feet. The patients initial vital signs were: 110/70, HR 56 and O2 99% at 1543. He stated that he felt some shortness of breath but was able to speak to us without difficulty. No wheezing or rhonchi present. We kept the patients legs elevated and provided a cold pack to his head and neck. After approx 10 minutes the patient stated he felt better, but he felt cold and his legs and upper body were shaking. Once we sat him up into a sitting position he stated he wasn&#39;t feeling dizzy. We kept him there for another 10 minutes until he felt better. His vital signs were measured again and his bp was 140/90, HR 91 and O2 level was 99%. The patient denied any difficulty breathing. This nurse advised for the patient and his father to go to the Emergency Room if another episode of this occurs. The patient understood and he walked with his father to their car without any difficulty.

I softball size raised red spot surrounded the injection site (slight off center, a bit lower where the injection site is more at the top of the softball sized spot).  The injection site was very itchy, and the large red spot was hard, raised, and itchy.  I looked up what this was and saw that is was extremely similar to &#34;COVID Arm&#34; and saw that is was atypical, but ok and that it should go away in a couple days to weeks.  Which it did, at this point I feel a slight sore tingle around the injection site, but no more red spot or itchiness.

                                                I felt like my stomach was going to explode the day after getting the vaccine.  The amount of pressure in my belly, it felt like something was going to burst.  I was able to throw up 5x, which relieved some pressure, but I was still very uncomfortable.  Yesterday and Today (Day 3 &amp; 4 post vaccination shot), I have been monitoring the pain in my stomach, and the pain has traveled to the lower-right portion of my stomach.  I am afraid my appendix is going to burst.  I?m going to see a Dr today.  I believe this is very unfair to me, an essential employee, who never contracted Covid-19 while still attending work over the last year, I was encouraged to take the vaccination shot by the state and my employer, and now I?m afraid I will need surgery.  Please look in to this.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

I see numbness on the same left hand side fingers.  I see similar symptoms on my right foot with swollen and enlarged nerves with dark color. The foot area has moderate sharp pain.  32 hours after, I experienced sharp pain on back of my left leg thigh area. Bit sensitive to touch and feel the pain. Not sure these are symptoms of vericose veins or thrombosis kind.

I would go from normal temperature of around 98 to 101 or so and back within a matter of 20 minutes.  Additionally, random parts of my body would get very hot at times.  About 2 hours after the side effects started, I became nauseous and threw up.  I was unable to eat for nearly 24 hours.  It seems that the fever and most side effects subsided through the 2nd night after vaccination.

I went to the ER and was treated for Bells Palsy and ear infection. The next few days resulted in extreme dizziness, nausea, headaches and nerve pain.  I was extremely weak and could not move due to the pain and vertigo like symptoms.

                                                I went to bed around 10pm feeling very cold an shivering. I was able to fall asleep, but then I woke up at 2am feeling very thirsty and experiencing intense nausea. I got out of bed to get some water. When I exited the room the nausea intensified so I knelt on the floor to wait until it passed. It didn&#39;t really pass so I stood up to try and get back to the bed. After a few steps I blacked out and fell to the floor. I was only unconscious for a few seconds, as confirmed by my wife who heard me fall. When I came to, I was lying face down and still experiencing intense nausea. I was also very hot and sweating, and very thirsty. I laid with my eyes closed an breathing very heavily to suppress the urge to vomit for a minute or two. When the urge to vomit began to subside I took a few sips of water while still lying on the ground. After another minute or two I was able to get up and get back into bed. The extreme nausea subsided after a few more minutes and I was able to drink more water. I went back to sleep after that. I woke up in the morning around 7am. I felt a little &#34;off&#34; for most of the day: slightly weak, a mild headache, with some difficulty focusing. But since then I have felt normal.   I didn&#39;t seek medical attention or take any medication. I have experienced Vasovagel Syncope as a child so I expect that I am more susceptible to fainting like in this case.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

Upon assessing the patient he could not respond to questions and his eyes were glazed over. For a couple of minutes the patient was completely zoned out and could not respond. EMS was called to further evaluate the patient. After a few minutes the patient came back to and was able to respond to questions.

Patient reports dizzy spells over the past few days with shortness of breath and then last evening developed a diffuse rash over his chest and extremities associated with itching and burning sensation on 5/1 evening. He denies any nausea,vomiting,abdominal pain,diarrhea.No chest pain or cough.Denies headaches.Denies h/o of prior allergic reaction/concerns to the first dose of the vaccine or any other vaccine.Denies any new exposure other than as stated the 2nd dose of the covid vaccine. Treated with IV steroids, IV Pepcid, and IV Benadryl with improvement. Upon discharge, directed to continue Prednsione 40mg daily for three more days for a total of five days of steroids, and follow-up with PCP. SUBSEQUENTLY, returned to ER  acute onset of decreased visual acuity, diffuse arthralgias, joint pain, myalgias, lightheadedness, palpitations, vertigo, muscle spasms, and difficulty moving both upper extremities. This was accompanied by sharp, 10 out of 10, nonradiating, diffuse anterior chest pressure. Nothing made this better or worse. The patient was driving at that time, and was unable to control his arms, which resulted in his vehicle leaving the roadway.  He was able to bring the vehicle to a stop before crashing. Since then, his symptoms have gradually improved, although they have not completely resolved. The characteristics are identical to the events that led to his previous admission.

I advised pt to stay in clinic for 15 mins or more if needed and pt agreed, and I also gave him 2 small bottles of water and highly advised him to drink them while he waited the 15 mins. I asked pt if he wanted to sit in our exam room but declined and stated that he would sit outside in our waiting area. After 5 mins (around 6:25pm), customer came and told us that someone was laying on the floor. Patient was found on other side of wall divider on the LT hand side of our waiting area laying on the LT side of his face and on his stomach. Pt aroused immediately to tactile stimulation and me calling his name. He was oriented X4 and stated that he was okay but wanted to lay on the cool floor for a moment. Pt was cool and clammy to touch and skin color pale pink. No hematomas or lacerations noted to face or head. No seizure activity noted. Stayed on floor for approx 3-4 mins and myself and another person stayed with him. There were 2 other patients present in the waiting room at the time, and the pharmD, also responded to make sure that we did not need any more help. After 3-4 mins of pt resting on floor, he agreed to get up and go into exam room 2 to lay on exam table. Patient said that he knew he was going to pass out because he heard ringing in his ears so he sat on the floor. He said the next thing he knew, I was calling his name and he was laying on the floor. Pt was escorted by me to room 2. AAOx4. V/S taken at that time: BP 120/80 HR 74 RR 16 O2 sats 98%. Skin warm and darker pink. Exam table put in incline position and pt resting there until 6:40p. Drank his 2 small bottles of water that was given to him and was stable upon leaving clinic. Offered to call someone to come get him but pt declined.

                                                Around 2 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose, I woke in the middle of the night gasping for air. My heart was racing and I was so weak that I could barely sit up. The following day I could not get out of bed. I also had an intense headache, which is unusual for me since I never get headaches. On the 3rd day I developed dizziness/vertigo. Since those events occurred, I&#39;ve been dizzy 24/7 and had about 25-50% of my normal energy. I cannot drive, I cannot work, I cannot many of my normal daily activities. This has been devastating. It has been over 3 weeks now with these symptoms, and I will probably lose my job this week. I don&#39;t know where to turn. There should have been a safety net for these things.

                                                1) Heart Palpitations.  I developed episodes of prolonged heart palpitations 12 days after my second Pfizer shot.   Sometimes I have an irregular heartbeat (80 BPM); sometimes I have a racing sinus heartbeat (120-130 BPM).  My normal resting heart rate is slightly below 60 BPM.  The palpitation episodes occur 2-3 times/week, and last from 2 minutes to 2 hours.    I contracted Covid-19 in March 2020 and had mild cold-like symptoms that lingered for around 6 weeks.  In June 2020, I began to experience the palpitation symptoms I am feeling now.  My symptoms subsided and disappeared from December through April of this year.    I am undergoing tests to determine what is causing my palpitations.  EKG and Echocardiogram came back normal.  I wear an Apple Watch that has confirmed Possible AFib / High Heart Rate during my episodes of Palpitations, using the ECG feature.  2) Migraine Headaches.  3 days after the second Pfizer shot, I began experiencing daily headaches on the left side of my head.  The headaches typically begin around the mastoid area, but alternate in other areas including above my left eye, left temple, left sinus, and back of head.  The headaches come and go, and are varying severity, but I&#39;ve had some form of headache on same side of head every day since April 8, three days after my second shot.

A 36-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06Apr2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm from 16Mar2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not diagnose with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was very sick for 4 days: fevers which came and went, chills, sweats, nausea, loss of appetite, light headedness, lack of energy. As a result of his immune system being weakened, he wound up with Cellulitis which he was still fighting over 3 weeks after the shot. As the patient was normally a healthy male, it was strange that he would wind up with a bacterial infection. The patient also stated that after the second dose he experienced cellulitis in his left leg to thigh area. He went to emergency room for scan and to rule out clot. He thought he was immunocompromised and that was why he got the cellulitis in the leg. Caller wanted to get the compensation information to help with the bills. The events onset date was 06Apr2021 17:00. 2 rounds of antibiotics was received for the events. The events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ultrasound with unknown result. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                I got Pfizer covid vaccine (first shot) on April 9th and have been suffering from prickling (pins and needle) on my body. This prickling happened randomly anywhere in my body (feet, arms, chest, all over the place of the body) and happened frequently everyday since I the second day I received the vaccine.    It is six week now since I got the vaccine, but pins and needle feeling still haul over me. I search online and found there are hundreds of people complaining about the same side effect I had. Some even say that this pins and needle feeling persist for months. I am not sure whether this pins and needle feeling eventually goes away. and I hope someone looks into this side effect and give us some guidance since there is no official document talks about this side effect.

I also had jaw pains and low blood pressure which had me get me on the stretcher for about 55mins. My teeth also went numb as well. About 12 hours in I had  a burning sensation in my checks and the site where I got my vaccine.   First dose vaccine lot number is EN6200 I received this vaccine on February 26, 2021. With the first vaccine 20-25 after the vaccine I felt like I had a brain freeze, After one hour I had face tingling and throughout that day the face tingling got worse and my face went numb. I had right toe tingling with the first and second vaccine. The muscle spams happened three days after the vaccine and I still have muscle spams today.

I have waited 24 hours for the symptoms to subside, but they are the same as of today.

Went to primary doctor who then sent me to physical therapy. During my first visit, the physical therapist found that the was significant weakness on the left side of my body. The therapist suspects the vaccine shot  temporarily enhanced a previously unknown issue enough where it became noticeable.  The therapist says this &#39;enhancement&#39; effect would go away in time.

On Saturday night (May 8th) I expressed to me wife that I noticed that I couldn&#39;t close my mouth all the way, and my face was really numb.   When I woke up Sunday morning the entire right side of my face was paralyzed. I was unable to close my right eye, flare my right nostril, open the right side of my mouth.  We went directly to the hospital thinking I was having a stroke, and it was there that I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy.

                                                EE reports he received pfizer vaccine on 1/21/21.  He noted extreme fatigue on 1/22/21 and today 1/23/21 noted an inability to form words and talk while on the phone, dizzy, tongue is half numb, and notes sweating.   EE advised to f/u with ER for assessment.  Consult with Dr.  e-mail was sent alerting her to this reaction.  MAJ follow up on 1/26:  ED record reviewed.  EE had vaccine injected on 1/21 and experienced chills and nausea on 1/22.  On 1/23 he had 1-2 minutes of aphasia and R jaw numbness.  ED evaluation that afternoon revealed a well-appearing adult with normal vital signs and neurologic exam.  Assessment by ED physician was that this was not a stroke or transient ischemic attack but might be a vaccine-related adverse event.  The ee was referred for follow-up with his PCP, Dr. , who can be emailed if further follow up information is needed.  I suspect the ee became dehydrated from vaccine-related nausea and that this was the cause of his transient neurologic symptoms.

                                                It has now been more than 1 week since vaccination.  First couple of days were fine, but starting  26-FEB-2021, I&#39;ve been exhibiting all of the following: Fever - Friday 98, Saturday (3 measures over 5 hours) 99.1, 99.3, 99.4, Sunday 98.5, Monday 99.4 (at night, work up in body aches), Tuesday(97.5), Wednesday 98.5 Chills - mild, 1-3 times. comes and goes through past week.  Occurs more at night.  Feeling cold - wearing sweat pants, two shirts, long sleeve shirt, sweater, during sleep.  Constantly add/remove clothes to regulate temperature. During day, have sweat pants &#43; sweater on 78&#43; degree weather. Muscle pain - in back, moving daily. First started in right chest and back right shoulder, has now disappeared.  Now in middle of back, around spin area, hard and uncomfortable to sleep, taking IB profin helps alleviate pain, 2 to 3 tables over counter.  pain in throat around vocal box, could be due to sneezing, slight soreness to touch/aches. Feeling unwell - comes and goes, day starts fine, then around noon/1pm i get super tired and sleep.  Sleeping schedule is generally 10PM to 6AM &#43; naps through day Lose stools - from 25-FEB to 27-FEB, cleared up on 29-FEB Coughing - started on 03-MAR-2021, slight about 1 to 3 times an hour. Headache - comes and goes, use IB profin only when trying to sleep, all other times i let it be.  Good news: No swelling at injection site No redness at injection site  No Swelling at injection site  Final notes: Just feeling up an down, not taking anything besides IB profin for pain management. I was going to work everyday pre-shot with out issue. Post-shot, not feeling well enough to report to work out of fear of spreading anything that i got. Weekend immune system. Slightly grumpy demeanure since sick and interrupted sleep patterns.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at about 4:05 or 4:10 PM today (Wed, Mar 3, 2021). Right away I had the following symptoms briefly: chills and blurred vision. Around 4:20 or so I left in my vehicle. Shortly after, I had a few chills. I needed to use the restroom and pulled into a gas station. After starting to go the bathroom, I quickly began to feel warm and my vision began to blur. The next thing I knew, I opened my eyes laying on the bathroom floor. I then left the restroom and headed to my vehicle where I noticed I had perspiration on my forehead and was really warm.  Over the next hour or so I experienced chills frequently. They have since subsided.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

It was over 130 (normal rate is between 55 and 60 during sleep ) and I had a telemed visit and Dr. said to take Ibuprofen after 24 hour mark. The only other side affect, my bladder side was feeling small and I had to pee every hour. Ibuprofen helped break the fever. The symptoms were resolved by about the following night. My stress level measured by my watch was back in the normal range after I woke up the second morning.

                                                Well I?m alive. It started about 45 minutes after taking the vaccine. It began as heavy salivating and turned into a numb tongue. I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine, I had some minor arm soreness, which went away. I experienced no other adverse effects until the morning of March 21, when I woke up with a significant feeling of disequilibrium. I had never experienced something like this before; when I was stationary I felt fine, but when I started to move my sense of balance was noticeably off. I stumbled around my apartment for a bit before heading to Urgent Care, where I was diagnosed with Benign Positional Vertigo.

I drank a lot of water on Tuesday, but it seemed to help very little. A hot shower made me feel better on Wednesday night.

A couple hours after falling as sleep the second night after vaccination shot (Sunday night), I woke up very cold / severe shivering. After several hours I managed to fall asleep for approximately another 1-2 hours. The next day I experienced fever, shivers, general body weakness/fatigue, and muscle aches/discomfort especially in both legs. These symptoms lasted throughout the day.  That night (Monday night), when I got into bed, I was strongly shivering. I managed to fall asleep for 1-2 hours, but woke up uncomfortably warm. I was unable to fall back asleep until 4-5 hours later. I woke up 1-2 hours later, with most of my body dripping with sweat, and the sheets rather damp.  Tuesday and Wednesday: Symptoms came and went, mostly feelings of fever, chills, general fatigue, lost appetite, and mild light headedness. Sleeping remained difficult, able to stay asleep for &lt;4 hours each night.    As of today (Thursday), fever has subsided. Still generally feel fatigued, occasionally lightheaded.

                                                Low body temperature after physical exertion. Measured at 94.6 degrees when symptoms first appeared. Other symptoms include profusive sweating, joint pain, chills, fatigue, and tremors. Similar sensations as a fever. Increasing my body temperature via heaters, hot showers, and warm drinks temporarily alleviated these symptoms, but they returned with any moderate physical exertion. This lasted for 4 days.

Had to diarrhea over 30 times in one day, throw up several times. Went to emergency room for treatment. IV treatment plus anti naseau and anti cramping   Medication. Cramping was severe in upper intestine. Symptoms have decreased, but still linger after 2 weeks of 2nd shot.  Concern if side effects are permeant. I still very tired/fatigued,  have cramping, dirahaha, throwing up, aches muscles and joints- not feeling like myself and regret taking the vaccine if it results in lifelong side effects.

                                                About 5 min after vaccination, the patient was leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed while in the waiting room after his vaccination. I approached him and asked if he was alright and gently tapped his shoulder. He did not respond. I spoke louder, he did not respond. I shook his shoulder and spoke very loudly, he opened his eyes and rolled his head around and told me that he felt really dizzy. His skin was warm and he was sweating. He reported that he was breathing fine, that he just felt dizzy and hot. Over the next 5 minutes his dizziness decreased. He reported that the site of vaccination felt numb. Vaccination site did not show any redness or signs of local reaction. He reported that he was still breathing fine. His dizziness continued to decrease, and 25 minutes after the vaccine he reported that he did not feel dizzy anymore.  He asked for some water, which I gave him. He stayed sitting in the chair until an hour after the vaccine. He got up and walked around and reported feeling no more dizziness and that he felt fine driving home.

Comes and goes varying in intensity, usually a dull ache at the front of my forehead. Gets worse later in the day and into the evening. * Body aches--started in the shot arm, then moved to shoulders and neck and sometimes lower back. Comes and goes with varying intensity. Has persisted through day 9. Sometimes it feels like achey area is emitting heat. * Night sweats- started around day 3 * Congestion/sinus pressure--intense sinus pressure (not a runny nose or cough) starting day 4 persisting through day 9. C Currently taking a steady dose of tylenol and sudafed. Have been taking tylenol since the shot on 4/11. GP admits she has no idea if this is related to the vaccine or another virus. I would love to get some clarity.

About 6 months ago, he had a small, pea-sized mobile lump in the area, and it did not bother him. About 3 days ago, that little mass disappeared, and in its place, he had some pain, a slightly larger lump/swelling, and significant tenderness.  He said the pain was severe when he put weight on his leg or puts pressure on the lump.  It was suspected that he had a ganglion cyst that ruptured, and x-ray of the tibia/fibula was performed to evaluate for any bony abnormality.  It was not sure if this is a vaccine related incident. Report for record keeping.

Next day had a low grade fever all day and evening, extreme lethargy, and muscle aches all over my body, especially my back. That night, 2nd after shot, I had profuse sweating in bed while trying to sleep. Had to wake up several times to change clothes and bed sheets as they were soaked in sweat. Feeling better today, still a little lethargic but no fever or sweats. It?s been a rough couple days.

                                                Soreness around injection site starting within a couple hours. Woke up at 9am the next morning with persistent feeling of drowsiness. Fever starting around 10:30am, peaking after a few hours at around 100-101 degrees. Full body achiness accompanying fever, with most extreme discomfort around the injection site. Symptoms responded well to Excedrin at regular intervals, although never completely went away that day. Woke up the second day feeling mostly better, although still very drowsy, fatigued, and weak for most of the day. Fever came back around 11pm, up to about 99.8 degrees, but after taking Excedrin it went away pretty quickly. Woke up feeling generally ok the third day following the vaccine, but started to get a low fever (98.8 degrees) around 2pm. Took Excedrin and feel much better.

                                                Shortly after the shot which was painless to take, I felt soreness in my arm and stiffness in my neck and for about 1 min about 10 min after the shot my vision went slightly fuzzy and got slightly light headed but passed very quickly but I did feel flushed for about 30 min after. A few hours after though a fuzzy feeling over my head returned, my stomach was slightly nauseated, and had a slight fever.  This did not really go away before I went to bed for the night. My shot was about 1:15 PM EST this was noticed about 4-5 pm starting and lasting until bed. Around 4:00 Am I woke and my stomach was very nauseated to feeling like I would puke but I was able to go back to sleep. When I woke my left arm felt very sore, my stomach the rest of the day until sometime the next morning around 6 am was unsettled. No issues using the restroom. But the fuzzy headache had persisted but by the end of the night I had a very front sided top of the head headache that radiated to my neck off and on. Swallowing water hurt, lights were becoming slightly painful.  As well as my jaw ached a bit. I went to bed and throughout the night woke to a headache of the same nature but at time with a pulsing pain. Sometime around 6 am it did stop for the most part as well as my fever broke. When I got up for the morning and throughout the day now it being around 5:30 pm my stomach had stopped for the most part with the unsettled feeling, my headache for the most part disappeared but I still have this slight felling of something fuzzy laying on top of the front part of my brain.  It not a feeling of being on top of the head but actually a feeling on the brain.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 37 years, on Apr2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included brain tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. On 09Apr2021, the patient stated, &#34;I am undergoing immunotherapy treatment for a brain tumor. My doctors recommended I take the vaccine 2 weeks following my most recent treatment (administered every 4 weeks). Several hours after receiving the vaccine, the right side of my body was very weak and my balance was off. These symptoms went away by the next morning. 5 days later they came back and progressed. Ultimately, I went to the emergency room having trouble walking, using my right arm and staying balanced. All tests (MRIs, ultrasound, CT scan, extensive bloodwork, and more) proved that there were no apparent causes. Ultimately, it was concluded that I had a stroke and the vaccine was likely the main contributor. I am 37, in shape, and eat extremely well.&#34;  The patient was hospitalized for the events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: there were no apparent causes, computerised tomogram: there were no apparent causes, magnetic resonance imaging: there were no apparent causes, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 15Apr2021 and ultrasound scan: there were no apparent causes on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures (Aspirin prescription, Castor, physical therapy) were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Report  May 8th, 2021. Patient, had an appointment for his 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine May 8th 2021 at 10:00am. His first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 was at our Pharmacy on April 16th, 2021. At around 10:15am, patient came in with his fiancé, who is a doctor at pediatric department, shown on her name tag. After processing the paperwork needed for vaccination, Pharmacist on duty, went over the VAR to ensure the provided information was adequate before it was ready for my intern to administer the shot. Patient looked fine as I was able to have a brief conversation with him while waiting for the shot. Due to some insurance issues that needed to be resolved, at 10:40am, pharmacy intern, took the patient to Patient Health Room for immunization. At 10:45am, I was ringing up a prescription at Terminal 42 when hearing the word, Help, coming from the Patient Health Room. Within seconds later, the door was opened as I was running out the pharmacy toward the Patient Health Room to see what happened. The patient was lying on the floor, unconscious, while his fiancé was calling his name asking whether he was okay and rolled him to his side and supported his head. I reached into the cabinet and prepared to administer an EPIPEN to the patient, meanwhile, pharmacy technicians, asked and dialed 911. As his fiancé kept calling his name, the patient gained consciousness. I asked intern what had happened to clarify whether it was a reaction due to the vaccination or not. Meanwhile, the patient&#39;s fiancé stated this event was not unexpected. Patient was able to talk and confirmed he was fine. Unfortunately, it appeared that the patient bruised his nose and forehead with slight blood from a minor cut. We instructed the patient and his fiancé to stay in the room and offered assistance upon request until EMS arrived. Patient&#39;s fiancé requested an ice pack for his bruise. Later on, the patient appeared to be shaking, so I asked the fiancé whether it was okay to give him some GATORADE. His fiancé also requested a glucose meter to check his blood sugar. The EMS arrived within minutes and patient was transported to hospital Before they were leaving, I asked the fiancé if there was anything she would like us to do as well as offered a follow-up. She declined the offer. I also asked briefly if she could share his medical condition, but the fiancé only disclosed that the patient has needle anxiety. The EMS also said that they will take it from here, and there is no additional action needed from our end at this time. Each team members who were involved in the event wrote reports and kept them filed in the pharmacy records.

A 37-year-old male patient received first dose of first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number and expiration date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Apr2021, as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not provided. On an unspecified date in 2021, patient started to experience severe migraine like headaches/ persistent severe headaches accompanied with sensitivity to light/ photophobia, body aches and fatigue. The reporter (physician) has tested the patient for multiple issues including COVID-19 and done blood work and all came back negative. The patient has had an MRI which was also negative for any abnormalities. Patient was treated with Aleve, Advil, and steroids but none of which resolved headaches. The patient was still suffering with headaches and photophobia and described them as intermittent with pain ranging from a 2 to a 9 on the pain scale. The patient was evaluated by a neurologist who stated that headaches could be associated side effects from the vaccine and has prescribed medications for migraines to aid in symptom management. The Physician was concerned due to the length of time his patient has been experiencing these symptoms since it was outside of the normal range of time for systemic type symptoms to resolve. He stated that patient was another wise very healthy with no other issues. Outcome for the events persistent severe headaches/severe migraine like headaches and photophobia/sensitivity to light was not recovered and for body aches and fatigue was recovered.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

A 37-years-old (current age of 37-38 when the reported events began) male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0I58; expiration: not reported), intramuscular, administered in arm right on 12Apr2021 16:00 as single for Covid-19 immunisation/covid precautions, not wanting to get covid at pharmacy or drug store. The patient medical history was none. Concomitant medication(s) included vortioxetine hydrobromide (TRINTELLIX; received within 2 weeks of vaccination). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine), no relevant family medical history. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and since the vaccination. No other products and no investigation assessment. On 13Apr2021, the patient had headache, sensitivity to light, was feeling lethargic, balance was off, fatigue, and hypersomnia. The headache and vision impairment (start date: 13Apr2021) were ongoing and began the very next day after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and at first the headache was very severe and now was just different and his headache kind of moved around and was always constant and persistent and got better and then boom it came back. The patient had been a little lethargic (start date: 13Apr2021) and that began the same day as the headache and vision impairment which was the very next day after the 1st dose of the vaccine. Dizziness (start date: 13Apr2021) began the very next day after the vaccine and was almost like an imbalance of whenever he was walking, he noticed he was kind of not walking a straight line almost and was going left and right trying to stay in balance (start date: 13Apr2021) and this was a little bit better. After the 1st dose the patient was getting a little concerned right now because he got the vaccine about three weeks ago and ever since he had been having severe chronic headaches and vision impairment that was ongoing and began the very next day after the 1st dose of the vaccine; the patient was a little lethargic, kind of had dizziness off and on and went to his PCP, had an MRI, and was sent to a neurologist. The patient was taking Advil, Motrin and Tylenol that were not helping his migraines (start date: unspecified) and nothing from the bunch of medications the neurologist gave him were working to help and stated Nurtec ODT (lot 3990840, expiry date Oct2022 and NDC 72618-3001-1) 75mg once daily and Nortriptyline 10mg (orange pharmacy bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC) supposed to be one capsule the 1st week and then two capsules after that by mouth. Motrin, Advil and Tylenol (no lot numbers, expiry dates or UPC numbers to provide because he ran out of those and threw the bottles away when he was done and has been meaning to get more but has not). Unspecified medicines, Toradol IV were given as therapeutic measure. The patient was not sure about the dates regarding his MRI (MRI was maybe a week and a half after this all started and then maybe a week after that he saw the neurologist). Headaches kept him up to night also and the patient had been to neurology, ophthalmology consultation, and received an MRI. The adverse events resulted in disability or permanent. The patient had not been able to work or drive since being vaccinated. The patient had no further treatment and had not gone to the ER but was under advisement that he was to go to the ER, but he could not afford to go to the ER. The patient had not had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine yet and his PCP and neurologist both agree that he would not be getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine due to the reactions he has had. The patient was calling to see if Pfizer offered help as he was without insurance and his PCP said he might need to send the patient to the hospital which might be out of the question and he was calling to see if Pfizer could help him with anything as he has not been at work for three weeks and the headache was not going away. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging with no results on unspecified date and nasal swab (sars-cov-2 test) was negative on 15Apr2021. The outcome for little lethargic/feeling lethargic was not recovered, severe chronic headaches was not recovered, sensitivity to light was not recovered, balance is off was not recovered, fatigue was not recovered, hypersomnia was not recovered, not been able to work or drive since being vaccinated was not recovered, vision impairment was not recovered, kind of has dizziness off and on was recovering and for migraine was not recovered.     Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

                                                After the first shot I began to feel a pressure in my neck. A few days after the second shot, I was walking across a street and my neck began to choke and my jaw locked up for about 10 seconds. It released a bit but was still very uncomfortable. I sought immediate medical help and was given steroids. The medical professional on staff said it was from the vaccine, but that I would be fine. I am now three weeks out from my second vaccine and my neck (rt side) is still stuck in spasm, and there is a growing numbness with a few painful spots growing up the right side of my face up to my eye. My Dad is an ophthalmologist, and he examined me. Confirmed the spasms in my neck and diagnosed the cheek numbness as infra-orbital neuralgia. He said he &#34;strongly believes it is from the vaccine&#34;. I went back to the original facility the next day  (5/17/21) and am now being referred to an ENT.

Along with tingling on the right side of my body, headache, fatigue.  Called pharmacy and was advised by a man that it?s fairly common and that it would go away in 24-48 hours and if it didn?t then to seek medical care.   As of 12:40AM on 05/22/2021 it is better but still not back to fully 100%.  It is now been 4 days going on 5 and I still have loss of sensation on the right side of my body of approximately 5% (tingling).  Have not taken anything nor sought medical care. Even thought a visit to the ER was recommended, Patient said he could still mostly function.

                                                After leaving site (while driving), my tongue became very heavy and almost difficult to swallow. After approximately 20 minutes, it passed. At the same time my right arm (opposite the injection arm) began to have muscle spasms which too passed. A wave of cold spread throughout my body and immediately my anxiety began to skyrocket (untriggered). None of these symptoms occurred after 1st dose.  Insomnia the night of both the 1st and 2nd doses.   Nearly 2.5 weeks after 2nd dose, dizziness is a daily occurrence followed by symptoms of vertigo (at times wakes me up at night). Fatigue has intensified.

Weekend of 5/8 - vomiting, likely fever (felt like true vaccine side effects) - no vomiting/fever since  Since then, lots of tests/dr visits.  Current symptoms: tingliness/numbness - left leg - midshin to foot/toes. Left arm - elbow to hand/fingers. Face started to tingle ~2 weeks post vaccine - left side. Extremely fatigued. Some brain fog/forgetfullness. Lack of motivation. Irritability some days. Headaches - some days really bad, other days none. Chest pains come/go throughout day. Was getting winded walking up 3 stairs but that has been slightly better. Some days - extensive muscle pain. Especially in lower back &amp; left hip area. Some days - whole body aches. Chills - feels like body temp is off. Things come in waves - numbness/tingliness is pretty much all the time though. Also, insomnia. Did start to take 1.25mg of melatonin as needed but still very fatigued.  5/19 - Stared acupuncture (plan is 2x a week) Around 5/21 - developed rash. Face (R&amp;L side), neck/jaw area (L), inner thigh (L). Doesn&#39;t itch all the time but when it does, it really itches. Has continued 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - headaches worsened 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - developed diarrhea 5/23 - more tingliness developed midshin to right foot and more in right arm.  5/25 - joints began to hurt more - especially in elbow area  Lung dr. Rx&#39;ed albuterol (?) on Friday, 5/21 just in case something was going on in lungs. Has not helped.   The lung dr. noted weakness in right leg during physical exam.   Lung dr. and cardiologist discussed possibility of Guillain Barre Syndrome. Another blood test was ordered to check for some receptors. Awaiting results.  Neurologist appt scheduled for 5/ 28

                                                I had the vaccine and later that night I  lost sensation in the tip of my right index finger about half a centimeter of my finger. I could not feel anything there. I could only feel extreme tingling the next day and ultra sensitive of pinching needles. And a couple of days later it became numb. And for my second dose I notified the medical personal about my adverse event and they did a medical test with a paper clip and I could feel that.

                                                After receiving 2nd vaccine shot in early AM, felt great throughout the day.  Around 9:30pm, I started experiencing shivers that turned into the worst shivers that I&#39;ve ever experienced throughout my entire body.  I could barely function, hands/arms/feet/fingers were shaking - even my jaw was uncontrollable clacking up and down.  At the peak, this transpired into an intense headache in the upper back part of my head that scared me to death, it was severely intense to the point I thought I was having a stroke or something.  My head pounded all night and also my body felt like needles were poking me in every joint in my entire body.  Sleeping was miserable and minimal and symptoms are continuing the next day but not as severe.  Lots of body pains and a constant headache.  Resting and drinking water to try and remedy.

                                                3 Days following my second shot, I felt a horrible shock/pain through my neck and jaw that made me crouch down in pain in the middle of a busy street. I went straight to an urgent care. The provider said it was a vaccine side effect and gave me steroids to take for four days. The next week, I went back because I began to feel a pulling sensation/pain develop on the side of my face. They referred me to an ENT. I went to the ENT.  He found a vocal chord nodule and ordered a CT scan.   Before I could make the CT scan appointment, I had an episode in the shower where I began to see flashing lights and my limbs became wobbly and weak. I was very dizzy and had to hug the shower wall for support. My wife took me to the emergency room where a multitude of tests were run including a CT scan. Nothing was remarkable, but the doctor was concerned about the neurological effects, and referred me to a neurologist.  I saw the neurologist the next day, and she diagnosed me with trigeminal neuralgia on top of ordering an MRI of my brain (normal). I am taking carbamazepine and baclofen as treatment for the condition. She said it can occur virally.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, May 18, 2021 at 1:53pm EDT. Many of the &#34;typical&#34; or &#34;expected&#34; side effects commenced about 12 hours later, including chills, night sweats, a slight fever (99.5), and headache and lethargy the following day.   Nothing was particularly off-putting until the afternoon of Wednesday, May 19, 2021, when I noticed small red spots on my legs and feet. A Google search suggested petechiae and enough cause for me to go to a nearby urgent care clinic. The petechiae were present on both legs and feet (and eventually a few spots on my hands), though a little more pronounced on the left side (with one noteworthy cluster on my left leg). I had no apparent gum bleeding or bruising (maybe one bruise, but the urgent care doctor thought it was there beforehand).  The doctor at the urgent care clinic confirmed petechiae and ran stat blood work for return that night. At ~9pm EDT on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, I received a phone call from the urgent care&#39;s centralized lab informing me that my platelet count was 2 (10^3/uL) -- dangerously low, with risk of spontaneous bleeding and in the worst case scenario brain hemorrhage -- and my PTT was 55.6 seconds. They told me to report to an emergency room immediately, the nearest of Medical Center.  The diagnosis was eventually Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). Every physician I&#39;ve encountered has felt that the occurrence one-day post-vaccination points to the vaccine as the cause. (For what it&#39;s worth, I do not think any of the doctors or nurses I encountered had never seen a platelet count so low. Most of them said as much.) My discharge papers officially note as the diagnoses: petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and adverse effect of vaccine.  I have included details related to my platelet count, treatment course, and other figures below (and am happy to provide corroborating information where appropriate). The doctors did not run any d-dimers, PF4 HIT ELISA, or fibrinogen tests, and no imaging was performed, presumably because I did not present with any signs of simultaneous clotting (e.g., TTP or VITT). They&#39;ve also told me that my haptoglobin and hemoglobin levels were normal (see below), which I am told helps support the notion that there was / is no clotting or &#34;red blood cell breakdown.&#34;  Search terms: decreased platelet count, immune thrombocytopenia, ITP, severely low platelet count, low platelets, petechiae, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia, vaccine-induced ITP

Took Tylenol in the evening and took another dose at 2am. It was about 78 degrees in our house that evening, and I had a comforter and another blanket on in bed.  The chills subsided by 7am, but then my body felt like it got hit by a truck and was hard to move or get out of bed. I had to stay home and attempt to work from home, although the body weakness and headache lasted until 8pm on 4/28.  Overall, it felt like flu condensed into a 24 hour period.

He woke up his mother at 5:40, came to his mothers room and said that he was shaking, and mother noticed that he was, trembling.  She asked what was wrong and he said that he could not stop shaking and his chest was hurting.  She set him down in a chair and she got the autometer to check his BP and oxygen, and his BP was 134/98, and his 02 was 96, heart rate 86.  She felt him to see if he was having a fever, it was 98.4.  She told him to sit for a little while and waited about 10 minutes, she checked his BP again at 6:00 AM, and it was 139/102, he said that he was feeling really dizzy, his head started hurting real bad.  He said that he had a bad taste in his mouth.  She just monitored him, and his 02 was still 96, heart rate was still good.  He stayed in her room until 6:15 and she got up and told him if he got worse she would take him to the ER.  At 6:25 she gave him two 500 mg of Tylenol tablets and sat him in a recliner.  At 7:30 his head was still hurting, but he was not shaking, and she gave him some yogurt and water.  He stated that he started feeling better and around 7:40 he went back up to his room and went back to sleep.  He has been ok since then.

I received my second shot on Feb 23, 2021 and had a headache/ minor migraine two days later. By the next day I was alright. On approximately May 4, 2021 (I can&#39;t recall the exact date) I briefly experienced light pain in my chest while using an under-desk elliptical at work. I am in good shape and that has never happened before. I last had an ECG in October 2020 during a physical for my job, and there were no issues at the time. The pain lasted four about a half hour and then subsided. Exactly one week later on the afternoon of May 11, I experienced the pain again at work while sitting at my desk, but that time for approximately ten minutes. I have not experienced any further pain and never saw a  doctor concerning the pain.

They are looking at possible nerve damage to the arm. According to the patient&#39;s brother, the person administering the vaccine went in at an angle that is not 90 degrees and therefore did not administer the vaccine correctly and caused injury to the person they vaccinated.

Had mild headache and sore arm but otherwise felt well. Had labs drawn - found to have highly elevated bilirubin (23) and LFTs in the 700s. Was admitted to the hospital and had CT showing Cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis and minimal intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Left hospital and was admitted to another facility where plan was for ERCP and cholecystectomy. Ultimately unclear if at all related to the vaccination - may be coincidental.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

                                                Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 at 15:15 hours.  A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol.

He didn&#39;t know if it is an allergic reaction. He thought that burning over the skin is an allergic reaction. He knew they didn&#39;t know a lot about the vaccine.

When I came back around 4pm I was feeling okay, no sore on the injection site, unlike my regularly flu vaccines that I mostly feel sore at injection site which lasts about few hours immediately after the flu shot, so it was sort of surprising to see that but later that night, my body starts feeling weak, aches and a tangling on my feet, as the night progresses up to the early morning, I was unusually fatigued and lightheaded with the regression of the muscle aches and subsequently other symptoms started disappearing, notably, I started feeling soreness on the injection site, which lingered to the next day.

On 12/25,   seven days after  receiving the  shot  I started to get right lower leg pain and I kept complaining about it till New Years Day. I had no symptoms of a DVT.  I triaged on 1/1/21 and the doctors  ordered  labs/imaging  and the results were  as followed: D-Dimer  biomarker  (&#43;) , Ultrasound of the Rt lower leg ( - ) ,  CTA showed a PE (segmental right upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus). I  was discharged on  Xarelto and advised to follow  up with a hematologist. On 1/5/2021,  I went to hematology and they did a whole bunch of labs. I was sent to get a  ultrasound   of the leg because the pain persist and they found  a clot hidden by my soleus. The plan is to continue on the Xarelto for 6 months. Come back in 3 weeks to scan my leg again and get my lab results.  On 1/12/2021, I received the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccination.

Got up in the night to check on my kids, had been standing for about 2-3 minutes when symptoms started, and passed out in the hallway about 60 seconds after symptom onset.  Recovered consciousness within a few seconds, had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes due to nausea, then got back in bed and went back to sleep.  Woke up 3 hours later and felt completely fine except a little fatigue - all other symptoms had resolved.

A 38-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 07Jan2021 09:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, hctz, amfetamine sulfate (AMPHETAMINE-SALTS). The patient previous received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 17Dec2020 11:00 AM for covid-19 immunization. The patient experienced extreme pain in his right thumb/ very sharp pain in the middle and base of my thumb on 09Jan2021 05:00. The event was reported as serious per disability. No treatment received for the adverse event. The adverse event result in disability or permanent damage. 36-48 hours after the second dose, the patient started experiencing extreme pain in my right thumb whenever he attempted to use his right hand for something including the simplest of tasks like tying his shoe. When he holds, lift, pull using his right hand he experienced a very sharp pain in the middle and base of his thumb.  At first, he thought maybe he hit it on something, but he did not.  A week later his wife was at work (she was a hair stylist) and was talking with one of her clients.  Her client who is a nurse said recently she had also taken the vaccine (2nd shot) and said the weirdest thing had happened. She told her that she can&#39;t hold anything in her right hand, and she has been experiencing unbearable pain in her right thumb when she used it for anything.  The pain has lasted almost two weeks now and was not going away. He still speak with the lady who has pain too and she said the same thing and he know it came after the second shot of the vaccine. The outcome of event was not resolved. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered: Hospital. No other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient wasn&#39;t diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hadn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. Not known allergies.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported &#34;pain in thumb&#34; and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.

                                                No history of severe allergic reactions.  Observed for 15 minutes following vaccine injection.  Felt fine at that point so I was told that I could leave.  About 10-15 minutes after leaving (about 25-30 minutes after vaccine injection), I started to feel tingling in the bottom half of my face (most noticeable in the bottom lip and chin area), slight swelling on back sides of tongue, and slight swelling of area under chin at the top of the throat (right side only).  I could still breathe, drink, and talk normally.  Although symptoms did not seem to be intensifying, I decided to seek care at a nearby urgent care out of caution.  I arrived at the urgent care about 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms (about 45 minutes after vaccine injection).  Provider evaluated me, administered pepcid and a Benadryl shot, and notified me that if I went into anaphylactic shock that they would administer an epipen and call an ambulance.  Vitals were normal and remained normal throughout observation.  Symptoms began to abate about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Tongue swelling abated first about 15 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Active tingling in the chin abated about 30 minutes after Benadryl injection, although light numbness remained.  Swelling under chin abated about 45 minutes after Benadryl injection.  Provider or staff checked on me every 15-20 minutes.  Provider released me from observation after about 2 hours.  At that point all symptoms had abated with the exception of slight numbness on bottom half of face, which persisted for several more hours.

I was nearly calling 911 that night - My wife ended up taking me to urgent care to be seen for headache. CAT SCAN and blood work to rule out aneurisms. I was given: Injection of Toradol -a steroidal anti-inflammatory. Viral inflammation in the brain caused by the vaccine - their diagnosis. Out of work for a week. I experienced symptoms on and off for three weeks - headaches; somedays I feel good and some days I don&#39;t feel good - with low energy and weakness and body aches. I have been taking (alternating) ibuprofen and Tylenol - the first week nothing could help but after that the alternating doses did start helping. I haven&#39;t had a headache for about a week now.  The body aches and low energy is still not resolved - comes and goes.

Went to Hospital ED per Dr. and was diagnosed after stroke was ruled out. The facial weakness progressed over the next couple of days, and I was unable to move any muscles on the right side of my face. I started recovering on 2/11/21, and have regained some movement back in my face. It currently feels like I have about 10% of my muscle movement back.  I did take a five day course of Prednisone 60mg daily, which was started on 2/3/21.

Had first COVID-19 vaccination on 2/13.  Cannot exclude paraneoplastic syndrome; possible hilar mass noted on CXR will need further work-up to rule out sarcoid/malignancy. Concern for viral meningitis.  No known sick contacts. Another tonic-clonic seizure occurred around 08:00 on 2/24 AM with vomiting; no overt aspiration though certainly high risk given situation.&#34;

                                                seizure 3 days after vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 38-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure. The patient had known allergies: Risperidone. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced seizure 3 days after vaccine on 25Jan2021. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of event was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported seizure cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

We took his blood pressure it was 136/88.  He started to mention his chest hurting.  His past medical history includes fainting in the past (due to low blood sugars) and open heart surgery as a child.  He is currently under the care of a cardiologist.  More recently he has had several fainting spells which he believes is due to low blood sugar.  He stated he had eaten a good lunch around 11:30.  It was about 2:30 when this incident occurred.  We offered the patient, a banana, orange, chicken sandwich and water.  He ate the orange.  We called EMS.  When they arrived, they checked his blood sugar which it was 95.  He started to feel better and his wife drove him to the cardiologist.

Later that night after going to bed he woke up w/ his muscles and nerves twitching and tingling.  He says you can sometimes see the muscles spasms and then other times he feels it tingling under the skin. Pt is still having these symptoms. He had a sore arm for about 48 hours. For about 3 to 4 days he had a faster heart rate and higher blood pressure than normal.   He developed a headache that lasted about 2 days.  Currently he is having some brain fog  and his shoulder and biceps still have a heavy feeling like they are detached from his body along with the muscle twitching and tingling.  He does not feel like these symptoms are improving and will see his PCP on 3/29/2021.

It made it really hard to sleep.  I woke up the next day on 3/28  feeling extremely fatigued with a bit of body ache.  I then took two more Advils that day.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy - a feeling of facial paralysis and severe muscle weakness where the neck muscles meet the lower left jaw. This came on quickly as I was sitting down several hours after receiving my first dose, and then subsided over the course of the next 15 minutes or so. I have however a returning sensation of a weaker form of it today, three days after the vaccination event. - a feeling like I can&#39;t fully clench my jaw on my lower left side without a notable tingling sensation.

Emergent CT head and MRI brain and ear were unrevealing.  20 session of hyperbaric oxygen therapy from 1/21-2/21 without substantial improvement.  Vasculitis workup negative with normal ANA, CRP, ESR, ANCA, CBC, CMP.   3/21 COVID-19 antibodies test for exposure negative.  4/21 noting more public event reporting of hearing loss and tinnitus associated with vaccines. reports-grow-amid-covid-19-vaccinations/) while I understand there is not causal evidence yet linked, I feel that there is a temporal relationship and odd correlation that needs to be recorded and accounted prospectively further.  Vascular surgeon, Hematologist who are treating me for a PE and DVT post ankle fracture and surgery do not correlate the SSHL with my DVT, PE, or anticoagulation.  To date 3 audiometry tests demonstrate persistent left-sided moderate high-frequency hearing loss.

                                                After taking my 2nd Shot for Booster on the morning of Friday the 5th of 2021. I ate and hydrated for the day. At home I was resting when standing up I was overwhelmed with dizziness, nausea, sweats, and then the chills and heat hit. My inner core felt frozen. I couldn&#39;t move after standing up and the chills locked every bone in my body I couldn&#39;t breathe. Terrified doesn&#39;t cover how afraid I was at that moment. Teeth chattering, fingers rigid, and my back was solid. After moments in this state, I put on layers of sweaters to warm myself. The outside temperature was 65-70*C. So not that bad. I was in shock and not long after putting on my sweaters. My skin felt like it was sun burned and all the weight of the clothing was painful.  I could not lay down, or even roll on my side for rest. Even standing up made my spin hurt.  The muscles in my lower back seized up and the pain was right in the middle of my spin. (The ER Doctors checked and I do not have kidney stones.) I was fighting 99.3&#43; temp and rising. (This temp is accurate. I have phot evidence.)  There was no sleep that Friday night.  Saturday morning I called the first available chiropractor and went to that appointment at 2pm.  As a new client they don&#39;t want to go all out in the first session, but I was in pain with every breathe.  Hyperventilating and over breathing was causing issues with my head and stomach.  The session was amazing, electro therapy mixed with heavy cracks worked on by a professional did help, but only for a brief period of time. Walking away from the building I was still in more pain than ever.  My dad arrived to take me to the ER at roughly 6pm.   Doctors gave me fluid and anti inflammatory drip. Potassium and Tylenol.   It worked. The pain was unreal and I welcomed anything to end the suffering.

A 38-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 24Mar2021 09:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included indapamide, and fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for an unspecified indication. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL3248) on 04Mar2021 11:45 AM on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that on 24Mar2021 he received his 2nd dose of COVID 19 vaccine. On 25Mar2021 he woke up at 6:30am with fatigue and a stiff jaw. At around 2pm he began feeling feverish accompanied with body aches and it continued until 3:30am of 26Mar2021. During that time, he did not notice any face or jaw discomfort. On 26Mar2021 and 27Mar2021 he had little to no symptoms other than slight discomfort in his jaw. On 28Mar2021 he began to feel more intense symptoms in his face, losing the ability to move/control muscles in the right side of face. The symptoms were moving from his jaw to my cheek and impacting his vision. He reported that this was out of the norm, and it prompted him to contact his healthcare provider. On 29Mar2021 at 1:40, he sought care from his healthcare provider. After a full examination he determined that he had a moderate (level 3) case of Bell&#39;s Palsy (reported started on 25Mar2021 07:00). Bell&#39;s palsy resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. He was prescribed 80 MG/day of Prednisone for 7 days. The patient has not recovered from the events at time of report.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.

I am having difficulty swallowing, eating, speaking, and my salivary glands are creating an enormous amount of spit. I am in a great deal of pain and fatigue. I have taken ibuprofen but it only helps for a couple of hours. It is day 5 since the shot and it does not seem to be going away. If symptoms persist I will not take the second dose of covid.

                                                About 5 minutes after the injection I get a tingling feeling all over my body.  That quickly subsides. Then my heart rate jumps from 75 to 140. My face goes flush and I feel like I am going to pass out. This happened on the first shot so I purchased a blood oximeter for my second and watched it closely. My blood oxygen never went below 96 and mostly remained at 98.  Once my pulse hit 140 it immediately began to fall back to 75. About the time the nurse I alerted got there is was back to normal. I do not feel sick at all after either shot. Sure wish I knew what this reaction I am having was.

Went to the ER at Hospital and took a CT Scan and MRI which showed bleeding. Brother had normal blood pressure and everything was fine with him but the stroke happened after a week of his 2nd Covid-19 vaccine dose. He lost strength in his left part of the body and had a speech slur and double vision. He had to wear an eye patch and had a headache. Hospital said no surgery was needed and transfered him to Rehab for rehab. He is currently there getting treatment.

We kept checking his BP and HR, and although his BP was stable the entire time, his HR started out at 109 and gradually kept dropping. After 3-4 minutes of shaking, we called an ambulance and they took over monitoring the patient&#39;s vitals. It was determined that his vitals were stable, his blood sugar level was 60, and after a while, the patient stopped shaking. He was released to leave by EMT.

Next day, I went to the emergency department to have a complete heart check-up. All results came back ok. However, discomfort in chest lasted for three days and I had troubled sleeping. It was felt like myocarditis.

A 38-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8737), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Apr2021 14:00 at age of 38 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included mystery cough from 2018 and not ongoing, seasonal allergies, used an arnuity inhaler for this, ADHD and depression. Concomitant medications included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) from Sep2020 to Apr2021 for depression; bupropion from Aug2020 to 20Apr2021 for depression; amfetamine sulfate (AMPHETAMINE SALTS) from 2018 and ongoing for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Around 14Apr2021, he had cold and flu like symptoms. He said he had headache, and sinus pressure, drainage and congestion. He said he felt dizzy, and he compared his dizziness to a feeling one gets before one passes out. He said it is associated with head or eye movement, and that there was a nerve shoot through his head down to his arm. This was accompanied by a tingling sensation that would usually last for less than a second. He said this reaction lasted for 2 and a half weeks. Patient mentioned that he consulted his physician, and was prescribed with doxycycline, which helped with the relief of his cold and flu like symptoms, as well as the congestion. He said it has been cleared for 5 days now. On 17Apr2021, patient said he had fever with a temperature of 100 F. He was concerned because the fever had not subsided ever since. On 17Apr2021 he had onset of fever which was ongoing. He was struggling to narrow down the choices here. He was grasping at straws trying to figure out if this ongoing fever fits in the realm of rare side effects of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine and asked for further information regarding the fever. He later mentioned he also had cold-like symptoms and an other weird symptom. Fever was typically in morning temperature was 100.2 to 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit then got to about 101 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon. Cold-like symptoms was for the first 2.5 weeks had headaches, sinus-related symptoms like runny nose, congestion, sinus pressure. He thought the sinus pressure in particular could be associated with the other weird symptom he had. One of patient&#39;s sons daycare had a cold going around his class on 14Apr2021; some of the kids went home with colds and fever so he initially chalked this up to that. Otherwise he did not think so. As a kind of cover her but his doctor did prescribe doxycycline which he just finished the last dose so been on that for 10 days at 100mg twice daily. He thought due to that any of the sinus symptoms he had have dropped. He felt cured of those other than fever; only fully recovered completely about 5 days ago (06May2021). Patient had COVID PCR test: First test in Apr2021, probably on 19Apr2021 or 20Apr2021. Not admitted to hospital, no ER visit, but went to hospital that his physician was associated with to have chest x-ray (Nothing notable found) and blood panel (Nothing notable found, didnt lead to anything. Standard blood work nothing notable found. White blood cell-nothing notable found.) done on 24Apr2021. COVID antibody test on May2021 was positive (IgG positive for COVID antibodies, IgM negative, no active COVID). COVID PCR test in Apr2021 and 26Apr2021 was Negative for COVID. AE (virtual visits for the fever) required a visit to physician office. Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine delayed twice now; was supposed to get second dose on 03May2021 but since had a fever been told he can&#39;t. Outcome of event fever was not recovered and the other events was recovered on 06May2021.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

                                                I got gout in the big toe fingers in both my legs just 3 days following the 2nd vaccination shot, resulting in immense pain in my legs and making me completely unable to walk. I have been into an urgent care where they confirmed it is indeed gout and no swolenness due to fracture or infection.  I never had history or symptoms of gout or similar kind of illness ever earlier. I do exercise regularly, do not smoke or take alcohols, have properly maintained dietary habits and keep myself well hydrated. Given such lifestyle, the occurence of gout at an age of just 38 seems remote. So I have my doubts on the vaccine side effects. JUST A DISCLAIMER, I MAY BE WRONG.

                                                On day 2 or 3 of getting the shot, I started feeling a burning sensation in my chest and what felt like my heart. It was about 3 or 4 out of 10 on the pain scale. I also had intermittent tingling sensations, mostly on my cheek to the left of my nose, but also tingling in locations around my body which happened only a couple of times.  My heart beat rapidly. It was similar to the heart palpitations I get when I eat certain foods. It also felt as if my heart was constrained, as if its outer layers were less flexible than usual.  When the symptoms showed up I started following a fairly aggressive anti-inflammatory diet, mainly wheat/cereal and Advil. I spent most of the time  lying in bed facing up, in order to minimize strain on my heart. I had trouble laying on my side, since my chest/heart was sensitive to pressure. I also believe I was more acutely aware of the distribution of blood throughout my body, and laying on my side felt similar to being upside down in that blood was pooling heavily at the bottom, but I may be misremembering the sensation.  I don&#39;t know if I had shortness of breath, since I took care to avoid exertion. Since my heart was beating like crazy, exertion of any kind seemed like a really bad idea.  The symptoms did not change in severity for a couple days. On day 4 or 5 of getting the shot, I felt slightly feverish for about a 10 minute period. During this time, I noticed the burning sensation weakening slightly, and I began feeling a soreness on my chest near my left shoulder, which I believe is a lymph node area.  Each day after, the symptoms and my heart calmed down little by little.  ----  On day 9, I went to the emergency room since I still had heart palpitations and the burning sensation at about a 1/10 pain level. Just sitting upright caused my heart to go into overdrive. The hospital did not find anything out of the ordinary. I was given MAALOX, but the burning sensation was too faint to know if there was any improvement as a result.  Their best theory is that I had costochondritis.  ----  On day 11, after eating dinner I started getting &#34;chronic hiccups&#34;. These last anywhere from 10 minutes to a couple of hours without stopping. I am not sure whether food or drinks cause them. They are short/acute hiccups and happen at an interval of about 10-15 seconds. I have no history of such a thing.  ----  Today is day 12. The symptoms are noticeably better since I visited the hospital, but the burning sensation is still present around what feels like my heart and the hiccups aren&#39;t stopping.  My best theory is that I may have had an infection by the time I got the vaccine. Maybe I had an infection, not necessarily COVID but some related virus, that was kept in check below an immune response threshold until the vaccine came along and led to the immune system burning the whole infection down.

Day 10, arm pain returns at the injection site. Day 20 arm pain has spread in size and pain, i cancel the second shot. elbow and wrist become inflamed, tight, pain restricted. become sick for 5 days, headaches exhausted.  prescribed 40mg prednisone for 5 days. first day it took the swelling down, then swelling came right back 2nd day. pinky and ring finder go numb, paresthesia/paresis. nerve pain in forearm to hand. ulnar nerve at first then all fingers. arm injection pain throbbing. rash shows up on stomach (now at 3.5 to 4 weeks since shot) cannot grasp a cup, weakness and numbness in hand. At this time its confined to the injection arm. Over the next week nerve pain and numbness spread to left side of face, both arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, toes. physical therapist confirms elbow lymph node on injection arm swelling, hands turning red extreme pain and swelling, loss of feeling. nerve pain in the entire body, nerve and muscle spasms in all parts of body. Fingers and does burning at the tips feel like a string is cutting off circulation. Visibly red. Around the 4 week mark, fully unable to lift legs or arms, left half of face numb, zap/jots seizure like hitting my body. go to ER seemingly becoming paralyzed,  within hours strength of legs returns but with numb feet/toes. no diagnosis other than peripheral neuropathy. neck begins to swell, hurts to swallow, throat closing. trying to sleep, throat closed, wake up, completely unable to open throat cant breath. throat episodes lasted about 5 days and resolved. complete insomnia and 24/7tinitus. any attempt to sleep or become tired results in heavy body zaps like hooked to a tenz unit. can&#39;t use hands or type, arm to hand seized nerves, feel like shrunken or contracted nerves. PCP prescribes benzos to sleep. this allows some sleep with waking every hour. over the following weeks symptoms seem to improve slowly but still debilitating. today at week 8&#43; since one shot only, I am able to type again, but with nerve pain and numbness in all fingers. loud tinnitus, numbness in all limbs, episodes of extreme debilitating muscle fatigue come in waves, almost unable to stand agonizing muscle fatigue and nerve zapping. These full body muscle episodes only seem to come in waves of 24 hours, then seem to feel recovering, only to relapse again. injection site pain seems to have wrapped around to the bicep 24/7 pain. unsure if this is nerve or muscle. 3 ER visits, PCP visits, blood tests, no help. I cannot work, constant nerve firing muscle spasms and nerve pain and episodes of weakness so bad you cannot sit without agonizing pain. I am disabled from this and still searching for help

                                                My inner core began to feel as though it was shaking or pulsing, but no visible shaking on outside of body. It is an odd sensation I have never felt before. This has persisted daily and spread to legs and chest. Primarily, the sensation is felt when laying in bed, or when still.   Also note: After first dose, within minutes, I began to have a metallic taste in my mouth that continued for about 5 days.

A 38-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech, formulation: solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0167), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 20May2021 11:30 (at the age of 38-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing SSRI discontinuation syndrome which would come back whenever he was sick and apparently also from the vaccine and ongoing electric brain zaps when he would get sick or have a temperature ever since he was a child and was taken off of paroxetine cold turkey which induced electric brain zaps and they went away at that time but continued having them lifelong whenever he would get sick, and also in response to this vaccine which felt like a jolt of electricity in the brain. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included lorazepam; diazepam; paroxetine and bisoprolol. The patient previously took paroxetine. On 21May2021 at 01:00, the patient experienced upper arm was extremely tender, painful and could not lift it above shoulder height due to pain. It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                1st covid shot: 10 minutes after I felt light headed and numbness\tingles throughout my entire body for up to a minute. (didn&#39;t eat prior) 2nd covid shot: felt similar symptoms but only lasted a few seconds. (ate that day) ------------------------------------------------  Issues\Symptoms Week 1  May 2-8 Right eye started slowly watering on Sunday and kept going for a week  Dizzy moment on a trip. Eye stopped watering mostly by Saturday -----------------------------------  Week 2  Dizzy moment again at a friend&#39;s  house(hadn&#39;t eaten that day).  Numbness through arms/weakness. May 10th: Panic attack. I was driving home and felt the numbness go through my arms so I pulled off and called friends to come and get me and take me home.  Ended up calling another firend who is a nurse and she had me squeeze someone&#39;s hand and check my face for sign of a stroke etc.  She thought I was having a panic attack and said to get some food, take some melatonin and try to calm down and goto sleep which I did.  May 11th: Saw General doc  who ordered blood work and heart monitor. No recommendations for immediate issue. EKG looked fine.  Through the week Numbness and tingles in arms and head Ringing in ears, lots of head/sinus pressure, unable to focus, brain fog. -----------------------------  Week 3 May 19th: Had blood drawn for testing: Night before getting heart monitor I couldn&#39;t sleep because it felt like not breathing fast enough made me light headed to the point I could pass out and was getting worried.  May 20th: Fitted with a heart monitor for 48 hours.  I was freaking out when we got to the hospital and almost went to the ER but we went to cardiology and saw the nurse who helped calm me down and did another EKG which looked good. Blood pressure was high that day possibly from the anxiety. Stayed at my dad&#39;s the next few days with the monitor, had tingles a couple times, some pressure, but slept well. ------------------------------  Week 4 May 24th: Followup with General doc said blood tests looked good, not diebetic, blood pressure fine, no signs of heart problems.  Gave me 6 days of prednisone and Nasonex for possible inflammation of Eustachian tube. (didn&#39;t feel like they helped any)  through the week: Felt okish for a day and a half, drove to work and then towards the end of the day started feeling off, right side feels like it&#39;s floating up and down, sensation down through leg which lasted about a week. Pushed in between nose and cheek on right side and felt numbness/pain shoot through my head on that side Periods of ringing again though not as much but also periods of head pressure and pain if resting head on hands etc. ---------------------------  Week 5 Muscle spasms in both arms lasting a couple minutes, finger twitching on left hand.  Also had muscle spasms in legs since.  ENT visit June 2nd: Audiologist tested hearing and saw no issues. ENT  gave me an exam and did not find any issues with the Eustachian tube or any other problems.  Suggested to do see if the symptoms continue to lessen and if they dont then do a VNG test and if that doesn&#39;t provide anything that he would have to refer me to a Neurologist next to see if they can find anything.  After the visit I came upon a web site and found that there are 300 pages of other people posting having the same symptoms as I have been experiencing for varying lengths of time, some upwards of 10 weeks. https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/ At this point I am absolutely convinced my issues have been as a result of some sort of reaction from the covid vaccine. There are way too many people having the same issues in a similar timeframe for not to be true.  In the few weeks since I still have symptoms that come and go but don&#39;t last nearly as long when they do. However it can still be quite disruptive depending on the circumstance.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I felt myself get very flushed and slightly lightheaded.  This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

A 39-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 at single dose for prevention.  Medical history included none. There were no concomitant medications. Caller states, he received the covid vaccine 19Dec2020 and on 25Dec2020 he was experiencing left facial numbness, b/l foot numbness, b/l hand numbness on 26Dec2020, right side burning on 28Dec2020, Today (29Dec2020) he has had left thigh burning, and Left b/l gluteal burning and paresthesia. No motor issues and no tendon issues, all intact. Also had mid back burning on 28Dec2020 that comes and goes. He has heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus and/or with the vaccine and wants more information on that. Curious if anyone has anything similar? and makes mention of possible Gillian Barre Syndrome. States that he has had a potential reaction. He had his dose on 19Dec2020. On 25Dec2020 he developed left facial numbness, then later that day he developed bilateral foot numbness. On 26Dec2020, he developed bilateral hand numbness, on 28Dec2020 he developed right thigh burning, and today (29Dec2020) he has developed left thigh burning, and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia. States that he has been kind of freaking out about it. He doesn&#39;t have any motor issues. States that he heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus, but not with the vaccine, is that true? The left facial numbness resolved on either 26Dec2020 or 27Dec2020. States that the symptoms were concerning because it could have been a stroke. States his symptoms were moderate. States that due to the bilateral foot and hand numbness, he had a LP, brain and spine MRI, and blood work done on 26Dec2020. All came back completely normal. When asked about causality, caller states that it makes the most sense for his symptoms to be caused by the vaccine due to his age and the fact that all his testing was completely normal. Reporter seriousness for left facial numbness, bilateral foot numbness, bilateral hand numbness, right thigh burning, left thigh burning and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia: Medically significant. The outcome of the event left facial numbness was recovered in Dec2020. The outcome of the events guillain barre syndrome, stroke and mid back burning was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship the association between the reported serious adverse events with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had a sore arm that lasted about three or four days. It made it hard to hold anything heavy or lift it above my head for one day. One week later, I developed severe hives, and itching all over my body and it didn&#39;t stop until about 24 hours later. I went to urgent care. They put me on Prednisone.

Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours.  Low fever, chills, heavy heart beat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours.  Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours.  At ~4 days since the first shot, the facial numbness, heavy heart beat, and fatigue persisted, though the drooping became less prominent and the other symptoms have largely resolved.  At ~2 weeks since the first shot, the facial numbness has been constant, but varying in intensity, and the left-side facial drooping has returned multiple times.

It hurts to straighten my arm out. It hurts to bring my fist to my shoulder. It hurts to clench my fist tight. It&#39;s affecting my capabilites at work. I delayed reporting it because I thought it was just from getting a shot and would pass.

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 12:15 (lot number: EN6208) as single dose at the age of 39 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies: minor reaction to iodine CT contrast. Concomitant medications included fish oil, turmeric [curcuma longa rhizome] (TURMERIC), and xantofyl (LUTEIN); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced allergies (minor reaction to iodine CT contrast). On 11Mar2021 12:45 PM, within an hour of the shot, the patient started feeling dizzy. Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours. Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours. Low fever, chills, heavy heartbeat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours. Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours. Facial numbness, heavy heartbeat, and fatigue persist, though drooping has become less pronounced and the other symptoms have largely resolved at 100 hours since the first shot. Seeking guidance on whether further medical help should be sought (did nurse line call with insurance company) and whether the booster shot should be administered. The AEs resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. No other vaccines received four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.

After turned him over, his eyes were half closed, unconscious, non-responsive and were not breathing properly. Administered an epi-pen 0.3mg, the patient woke up immediately. Also called 911, EMS came and he was able to get up and walk.

                                                I received the 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine on 3/31/21 at  High School. Within a few minutes of receiving the shot, I started to have muscle cramps in my calves and arms, joint pain, general feeling of anxiousness and jitteriness. My right hand started to shake and it was difficult to completely control the use of my fingers on my right hand. It was difficult to hold onto a water bottle cap or pick up my iPhone to call my wife. It was like I temporarily lost some fine motor skills in the fingers of my right hand. Overall, this lasted for more than 30 minutes. I drove to get the vaccine by myself, however my wife had to drive me home. We got home about an hour after the shot. When I got home I changed into looser fitting clothing and felt much better. I did not need medical attention.  On 4/6 I had similar symptoms but not as strong so I contacted my dr. They advised to get a Covid 19 test today.

Concerned initially that patient may have been having a seizure due to twitching motion of head lasting 2-3 seconds. Then patient appeared to be sleeping.  He was breathing, but audibly snoring and it seemed somewhat irregular.  I moved patient from chair to floor and had staff call 911.  Patient was still breathing but remained unconscious for about 1.5-2 minutes.  He then woke abruptly and was immediately lucid.  He was awake when EMS arrived.  He stated he has passed out on previous occasions of abrupt pain/use of needles.  EMS monitored patient for around 20-30 minutes, and he also had a bottle of orange juice and a granola bar and appeared to feel better.  Patient declined transport to hospital by emergency personnel.

                                                In the Morning after my shot, I was getting breakfast ready for my kids. Everything seemed fine at the time and I started getting an odd feeling. Not really a dizzy or lightheaded feeling, but an odd feeling. The next thing I know, I came to on the floor. My security camera in the living room caught part of it from down a hall. I fell strait forward, onto my stomach with a large crash. The rest of the day, I did feel fatigue, joint pain in my knees and then chills/hot flashes later in the day/evening. The next morning (Friday) I woke up with a scratchy throat but felt fine the rest of the day.  I  have never fainted in the past. I don&#39;t know what would bring that on.  I also have not had that feeling or any fainting spells since that incident. My wife came home about 8am out of concern.

A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 25Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s prior vaccinations included tetanus shot on 09Feb2021. On 28Mar2021, 2 days after taking the first dose, the patient experienced reactions from the vaccine which included Itchiness on the abdomen area, knees, and toes and disorientation and went to emergency room for treatment. The patient wanted to know whether these are normal side effects of the vaccine. Upon follow-up on 28Mar2021, the patient reported that he felt weird after receiving the vaccine and lightheadedness. He told the nurse that he didn&#39;t eat before getting the vaccine. And wasn&#39;t sure if getting the vaccine was like having blood drawn so he hadn&#39;t eaten anything. The nurse told him he might be feeling lightheaded because he didn&#39;t eat and she gave him some lollipops and the patient felt much better. The patient also stated that on 28Mar2021, he was feeling overwhelmed and cannot describe the feeling. It was like itchy or pins and needles all over his body. The patient felt like he was going to pass out, as he as disoriented. The patient stated that he went to the Emergency Department. They kept him overnight, checked his heart, did some blood work, checked his blood sugar, gave him a Covid 19 test. The patient stated that everything came back normal. The Emergency Department concluded that the events could be due to the Covid 19 vaccine and described that his system was fighting the Covid 19 vaccine or something. The patient was asking if this is normal. He was also asking for a copy of this safety report for work purposes. The patient went to the Emergency Department on 28Mar2021 (around 7pm) and was in observation overnight. He was discharged from the Emergency Department this morning, 29Mar2021 at around 11:00AM. The patient confirmed that he was not hospitalized. The patient stated that he may be overthinking about the events and really paying attention to his body. He thinks he needs to rest as he was in the Emergency Department for a long time. The patient lab test included Blood sugar test. The outcome of the events was resolved for dizziness, unknown for feeling abnormal and overwhelmed and not resolved for other events.  Information on lot/batch number obtained. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine my blood pressured dropped considerably (it was measured at 77 by medical staff), I started sweating profusely, and briefly was unable to speak because I felt dizzy and felt as if I had no energy. After a few minutes, I recovered and my blood pressure resumed to normal (114). As this was happening, my partner-- who was with me when I experienced the allergic reaction--observed that my face suddenly became red and flushed (a minute after getting vaccination).  Medical staff did not  need to administer an Epipen. They had me lie down and breathe. After about 15-20 minutes I felt normal. Medical staff had me wait a total of 30 minutes before releasing me.

                                                I had pain at the injection site the evening of receiving the injection, which still continues, though not too bad. Walking up today at around 7 am, I felt headache, achy all over, weakness, and some fever. I decided to stay home. I lay in bed most of the day, sometimes sleeping, sometimes watching YouTube videos on my phone. I was feeling kind of cold, so I snuggled completely under the covers, head and all. I got sweaty and had to uncover my head. I changed clothes. I got up a couple of times to urinate. Once, I felt some weakness, and had to support myself with my hand on the edge of the bathroom counter. Then, this afternoon, my headache was a bit worse. I got up to hop top the bathroom. I was urinating standing up, when I started feeling weak, so I supported myself with my hand, but almost immediately, I started feeling like I was going to fall, to faint, and to vomit. I hurriedly sat down on the toilet. I was still feeling nauseated and weak, so I learned back to take pressure off my abdomen, which was feeling slightly bloated. The bathroom fan was on, so it felt rather cold, but I started getting hotter and hotter, sweating profusely. At the same time, I just sat there trying to recover, and started feeling pins and needles in my forearms, but not like they had fallen asleep, just like someone were pressing down on my arms with blunt needles. I thought I was going to have to crawl back to bed.  After a while, I started cooling off and feeling a little better. I went back to my room and changed clothes. I&#39;m feeling warm and a bit weak and achy again, but nothing like that. I had only drunk 3 cups of water today, though I drank about 7 yesterday.

Went to healthcare facility to check if should still get 2nd shot they told me I would need to see a neurologist. I got the 2nd shot 3 weeks after first shot and now issue spread into my neck muscles and leg cramps. Seems to be worse when it rains. Told me take anti-inflammatory but no help. My doctor gave me muscle relaxers neither has helped try ice and heat. Arm still burns. Took xrays. But I couldn?t get appointment with neurology til mid May.

By 4-28-2021, several clusters of sensitive and itchy red bumps appeared in my right armpit, on the back of my right shoulder, and right pectoral. Symptoms persist as of today, waiting to be seen by a doctor. It appears like shingles. I have had chicken pox as a child, and have not ever had shingles or the shingles vaccine.

A 39-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 19Apr2021 12:30 (39-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included psoriasis and asthma as a kid. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received ustekinumab (STELARA) 90mg on 24Jan2021; previously received sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and experienced allergies. At the 13 minute mark of the safety wait time, his face, tongue, lips and arm went extremely tingly. It was hard to swallow, taking a breath felt empty and his heart rate jumped from a normal 70 bpm to 90 then 110 while sitting within a few seconds of the tingling starting. He sat for 10 more minutes then left the pharmacy. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Observed a burning sensation in upper right pectoral major  that moved through right armpit at boundary between biceps brachii and right deltoid. Felt tight during arm movements sway from torso and over head, bringing medium severity burning and tugging sensations under skin. Suspected lymph node irritation from 1st Pfizer shot or damage from moving heavy furniture. After 3-4 days the irritation in right pectoral ceased and burning and tight sensation in deltoid area lessened by approximately 50%. Today as I write this there is little of this persisting - only noticeable in right deltoid area when moving right arm to the most extreme limits of its possible positions, such as above and behind head. This produces a minor burning and tugging sensation in the right deltoid area which encourages slow and careful movement to this extreme position.

The fist week we suffered severe migraines, abdominal pain, fatigue and dizziness to the point of being incapacitated. A week later, we are still too dizzy to work/operate our vehicle and are always tired.   Before this event, we are both in our 30?s, exercise at least an hour/ 5 days per week and have a very healthy diet. We went from the best shape of our lives to unable to function after this first shot.   I have reached out to my clinic regarding my symptoms and they have no answers.  I am terrified to get the second round as I have missed weeks of work due to this already.

Medical history included asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. On an unspecified date, prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19, unknown if ongoing. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. He had previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 on 08Apr2021 08:00 (Batch/lot number: EWP0158) (age at vaccination: 39 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Concomitant medication(s) included albuterol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler, naproxen (NAPROXEN) and calcium carbonate (CALCIUM CARBONATE), taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 29Apr2021, the patient developed shortness of breath, weakness, fatigue hours after administration of the vaccine. He had 2 episodes of syncope, 80% O2 saturation on room air (RA), heart rate up to 180. Rash on his abdomen appeared. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was admitted to the hospital on an unspecified date in Apr2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering a plausible temporal relationship, a causal association between the reported events and suspect drug bnt162b2 cannot be excluded.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0151), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Apr2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 39-year-old), as 2nd dose, single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 as single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Apr2021, after the second shot of vaccine, the patient experienced a sore arm. Patient felt sore arm for 2-3 days and then recovered completely. On 31May2021 Monday, morning around 07:00 or 08:00, the patient visited Emergency room because he thought he was having a stroke. But it was not stroke, and the ER told him he had Bell&#39;s Palsy. Patient thought it was a side effect and was given with medication for the event but was not able to afford it. The patient was not under any medications before the vaccine, but he continued medications for Bell&#39;s Palsy. Patient has not received any vaccines since the Pfizer vaccine. The clinical outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy was resolving, and the clinical outcome of the event sore arm was resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible.
