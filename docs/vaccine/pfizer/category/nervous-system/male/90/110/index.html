A 90-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 16Feb2021 (Lot Number: EL9267) (at age of 90-year-old) as 2ND DOSE SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation, stent placement from 19Jun2020 and ongoing (successful in the descending aorta), and ongoing Heart problems. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, administered in Arm Right on 05Feb2021(Lot: EL9263) (at age of 89-year-old) for covid-19 immunisation. The patient would like to talk to an individual regarding his side effects he has been having since his two COVID vaccinations in Feb 2021. Ten days after the second inoculation on 26Feb2021, he woke in the middle of the night with jaw pain. He was in great pain. The pain went down his left shoulder and back . His wife said that morning that those were signs of heart problems. He does have Atrial Fibrillation, and he had a stent placed 19 Jun 2020. He went to the emergency room where they checked him out for heart problems. He had a clean bill of health. They sent him home, and told him to take Tylenol for the pain. The Tylenol certainly helps. It took whatever number of days for it to subside. It subsided for 2 weeks, but then he developed pain down his right side of his shoulder, and down in his hips. Once again they figured they better get back to the ER. They did EKG and a X-ray.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with his stent. They told him just to continue with Tylenol to control the pain. He went a third time to the emergency room because he was having problems breathing.  The emergency room put him through the COVID entry at Kaiser because of the difficulty breathing. They re did all the previous work, and did a scan of his lung to check for blood clots. He thinks they did that because 6 people died from blood clots from Johnsons and Johnson. They wanted to see if there were blood clots, but there were no blood clots. They told him he needed to make an appointment with his primary who then referred him to a Cardiologist. On 11May2021, he saw his primary doctor who ordered another scan because they found possibly a swollen lymph node on his trachea. The doctor measured that, and said to wait a month to do that again. To see any change in it. On the 26 May 2021, he has his next appointment to get that rechecked. He hasn&#39;t had a comfortable day since this started. He has had pains in different parts of his body that last for 2-3 days and then some place else starts to hurt. His left ankle, right side heel, and shoulders also hurt. The pain  was under control if he takes ibuprofen, but his doctor advised him against too much of that because of his kidneys. It was very effective.  The Tylenol works to some extent, but not like the Ibuprofen. He is just living with it day to day. He can play tennis some days. One day he played tennis and came home with chills. His wife took his temperature and it was 100.3. In the last week and half this has happened two times. After the second shot this has happened probably four times. He has weird fevers for one day with no other symptoms. Ever since 26Feb2021, it has been on a daily basis that some place else hurts. One subsides , but another pain starts up elsewhere. If that is not happening, then his whole demeaner is dead. He is just not comfortable and sitting around he feels like he was wasting what life he has left. He used to be a PE teacher. He has always been in good physical condition. He was 5k and walking 5ks every 4th of Jul. He would compete. He prepared for this 90 birthday/ His goal was to do a 5k in under 60 minutes. He worked out like always , and played tennis 3 days a week to prepare. He also played ball. He likes to walk run 2-3 miles most days. He did his 5k in 52minutes, and he was celebrating. Then ten days later this all started happening. The patient/caller has been tested for COVID, and it was negative. The aches and pains were moving around. He was still having breathing difficulties. Sometimes he can&#39;t talk because of the breathing. It just goes away. If it is something like the tumor or a node on the trachea wouldn&#39;t it be happening all the time? Sometimes he can&#39;t talk because the breathing is bad. It comes and goes. It is more often recently. It is like all the sudden he can&#39;t breath and can&#39;t talk. That started right at the beginning. It has gotten progressively worse. He took Tylenol to help the pain in his body. Nothing has helped his breathing. He tried antihistamines to see if maybe it was hay fever or something , but there was no difference. He didn&#39;t know where to go from here. He was feeling horrible. He was  just waiting on 26 May2021, for the second scan without color of thorax to see those results. The patient said he didn&#39;t have questions. The outcome of events was unknown.

He received the second dose of the same vaccine around January 22, 2021. Pockmarks and bleeding scratch marks were noted by a family member on the patient&#39;s face prior to this second dose. On January 28, 2021 a family member was alerted that the patient was suffering from severe bullous pemphigoid- a skin condition that has never been experienced by the patient, has been reported to be related to COVID-19 viral infection, and to T-cell responses promoted by vaccines. A corticosteroid was given, but did not work. Blisters developed to the point hands had to be dressed.

After second vaccination, was not able to stand or move after 36 hrs, at which point he was taken to the hospital. At hospital, all vital signs were good except an MRI showed cancer in spine.  Shot was given 3/1 and my father passed on 3/18.  Obviously this shot did not cause metastatic cancer, but I believe it did induce an inflammatory response of some kind that caused it to progress extremely quickly.

                                                After the first dose my father got what the eye doctor thought was pink eye. After treating him it didn&#39;t clear up. It was later diagnosed as herpes of the eye and he became blind in one eye. Shortly afterwards I read an article from researchers who stated they had found fragments of the herpes virus in the vaccine. After the second vaccine he was fine one day and 2 days later started having seizures. He was hospitalized for the seizures. His personality totally changed. He no longer recognized my sister. He also became hostile which is not the person he was. He was released from the hospital and brought to a new facility. Then the lights went out. he just stared off into space. A day later he was dead.

It was reported that patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine 9 days ago. However, he said he was still experiencing mild tiredness, weakness, and dizziness. He wants to know if these side effects are still associated to the vaccine and if it is normal that he is still experiencing it 9 days after his 1st dose. He also mentioned that he has no temperature and his pulse and blood pressure was normal. It was then reported that patient was still suffering some side effects 2-1/2 weeks after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said the side effects come and go. He said the side effects will last 4-5 hours, and then go away, and come back the next day. He said he has checked his blood pressure and pulse, and they are both OK. He said he uses an oximeter to check his oxygen level, and his oxygen is good. He said he sleeps well at night. He said he is having periods of dizziness, weakness, and feeling tired and sleepy. He said he feels lightheaded and unstable on his feet, also. He said he feels fine now. He said his right shoulder is bothering him a little, too. He said his right shoulder was uncomfortable and bothered him if he laid on it at night. Reported his back was bothering him, so he bent over a little, but if he stands up straight, he was about 5&#39;10&#34;.

He said in the morning he will wake up and feel OK, and then after a while the side effects start. He said some days his side effects will start in the morning, and other days his side effects won&#39;t start until the afternoon. Patient declined any treatment. He said he read that any side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine only last 2-3 days. Reporter wants to know if it is a problem that he is still having side effects after 2-1/2 weeks or is there some action he should be taking. He said he figured Pfizer is the expert, so he would ask Pfizer directly. He said otherwise, he was thinking of going to an urgent care to see what the urgent care thinks of his side effects. There was no emergency room or physician office visit. There were no relevant tests. Reported his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was scheduled on 26Feb2021 at 9:30AM and asked if still can get the 2nd dose Vaccine after having a reaction to the 1st dose. No PQC was present.

On or before 30 Jan, he noted pains in one leg while walking.  Newly dilated veins on the lower leg were noted. On feb 2 a doppler US revealed a superficial saphenous vein venous thrombosis, also new onset A flutter. Aspirin begun. On Feb 5 he woke with a cold foot (same side) and was found to have an arterial thrombus from SFA through distal posterial tibial.  He underwent emergency thrombectomy, went to rehab for recovery, on Feb 23 suffered intracranial hemorrhage and died on Mar 10.

                                                My father was in weak condition to begin with.  He didn&#39;t get out of bed for the next few days after receiving the vaccine.  The little amount that he ate was consumed in bed.  He began aspirating his food which lead to pneumonia.  He wasn&#39;t strong enough to fight off the pneumonia even with antibiotics.   He died on 1/23/21.   While he might have passed soon in any case, I believe that the vaccine may possibly have increased his weakness/exhaustion thereby hastening his demise.

Medical history included ongoing prostate cancer metastatic diagnosed a few years ago and immunotherapy. Concomitant medication included ongoing abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) at 1g, once a day for prostate cancer and ongoing prednisone at 5 mg, tablet, twice a day, by mouth for immunotherapy. The caller stated she is reporting a reaction her father had to Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine. The patient experienced disorientated, in a lot of pain in his chest and rib area, hurt to breathe and move and short of breath/it hurt to breathe on 29Jan2021. The reporter seriousness for the events was medically significant. The events didn&#39;t require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The patient did go to urgent care.

He just received his second dose of his covid vaccination 3//26.    Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted to receive treatment for COVID 19 infection.  On presentation he was hypoxic requiring supplemental oxygen, he was in Afib RVR. He received experimental treatment with plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. He had a AKI in setting of infection that improved, and his lasix was added back. He has CKD3, would recommend re-check cr in 3 days after discharge.  He did develop acute urinary retention that required a foley to be placed. Void trail in hospital was unsuccessful, suspect relatedd to weakness/poor endurance.  Can considner ongoing voiding trails as his health improves and or outpatient urology consult.  Paroxysmal Afib in the setting of viral infection, with fluids and increasing metoprolol rates improved.  Once he recovers from Afib can consider MCOT to evaluate Afib burden, continue ASA     Covid pneumonia Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, from COVID Pneumonia Received convalescent plasma Received Dexamethasone 10 day course  Completed remdesivir 5-day course on 4/4/21  Oxygen Requirement continues at 2 L nasal cannula Inflammatory markers trended down He was vaccinated SECOND INJECTION on 3/26.    Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease stage IV Creatinine improved with IVF did upwardly trend again likley from acute urine retention  Cautiously watch Cr while on  Lasix, consider checking CR/BUN in 3 days Monitor creatinine, avoid nephrotoxins Discharged with foley, continue Flomax. Consider voiding trails at SNF and/or urology consult   Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation -new onset Metoprolol tartrate increased during hospitalization patient will benefit from outpatient event monitor to determine A. fib burden once he recovers from Covid, to be arranged by PCP continue aspirin

A 93-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261, Expiration date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Jan2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 93-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization in hospital. Medical history included muscle relaxant, blood pressure or cholesterol and broken neck from 1978 to an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing atorvastatin calcium 10mg taken once daily by mouth for blood pressure or cholesterol taking for a while, ongoing propafenone hydrochloride 150mg taken one twice daily by mouth, taking for a while, ongoing baclofen 10mg taken one five times daily by mouth as muscle relaxant taking for years, ongoing diltiazem HCL 180mg taken once daily by mouth, taking for long time, ongoing mirtazapine 30mg taken one at bedtime by mouth, taking for a while, ongoing citalopram HBR 20mg take once daily by mouth, taking for a while. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced unable to sleep, aches and pains, arm was sore, on 25Jan2021, experienced weakness, severe muscle weakness, on 26Jan2021, experienced increased confusion and on an unspecified date, experienced fatigue, unable to get up on his own, heavy breathing and thick mucus. But his father has tremendously decreased. Mentions his father was previously independent, using a walker, going to exercise class by himself and totally fine. Now after receiving the vaccine his father is unable to sleep, has aches and pains, was experiencing increased confusion and profound weakness. Adds his father can&#39;t get up on his own and has to be guided to use the walker if he can get up. They did call his HCP and were advised not to get the second dose and to make sure patient was eating and drinking. He was scheduled to receive the second dose on 14Feb2021 but he was unsure if he will get it. Adds his father had been water walking everyday and this wasn&#39;t like him. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                I received  my first COVID 19 Pfizer Vaccination on Jan. 21, 2021 from clinic about 2:30 pm. I am age 94.  My wife brought me home about 3:30 pm and I was tired and went to bed and to sleep. I slept soundly until about 8 pm, and my wife awoke me to eat.  I was too weak to sit up or stand, my legs felt like rubber.  I didn?t feel like eating, and I couldn?t answer her questions coherently.  My wife was worried and called the 911. They checked me and found my vital signs were normal, so they helped my wife get me settled in bed. The next few days I still felt weak and had to use a cane or walker.  My second dose is scheduled for February 11, 2021 at 2 pm.  Will I likely have worse side affects?  What precautions should I take.

A 94-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 13:45 (at 94-year-old) at single dose (Arm Right) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type is clinic. Medical history included congestive heart failure, early stages dementia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 04Feb2021 (at 93-year-old) on right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient had no covid prior vaccination. Patient has no known allergies. The patient (father) seemed to be doing fine until 19:45 on 26Feb2021 roughly 30 hours after vaccination. He has early stages dementia, so if he was feeling ill he didn&#39;t report anything, and they didn&#39;t notice anything. He got up from the table, notably shuffled the 10 feet to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet before we could &#34;pull down his pants&#34;, and then became non-responsive. The reporter said to her son it looks like he is having a stroke. They got him onto the floor. started him on his oxygen concentrator (usually used only at night), O2 went from 85 to 98; bp 155 from an unspecified date. after a while he came to. he is dnr, dni, so they didn&#39;t call an ambulance. Eventually they got him up. no signs of stroke. He does have congestive heart failure. This has never happened before, and he has no history of falling. Daughter was reporting the next morning. He has not yet been awake since this occurred. it is now 8am 27Feb2021. Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event o2 went from 85 to 98 was recovered, while for other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Pt is 94 yo male with PMH of afib not on anticoagulation, BPH, OA on chronic opioids, and depression. He presented to this institution on 4/19 with aphasia and confusion, concern for stroke. MRI showed no signs of stroke and at discharge 5 days later he was back to baseline. Pt underwent standard inpatient COVID-19 testing: rapid test was positive on 4/19, then PCR test was negative on 4/20. Patient is s/p Pfizer vaccine with his first dose on 1/20 and second dose on 2/10. He was asymptomatic, with no hypoxia and did not starts steroids nor remdesivir. Team decided that presentation is most consistent with false positive, but per ID and epidemiology, pt must remain in isolation for 10 days as a precaution.

                                                My arm is little sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for himself. A 95-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient also received apixaban (ELIQUIS), 2 dose forms (DF) every day, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at an unknown dose as blood thinner. Medical history included a bone spur in the left foot that causes the patient to limp a bit, although he is still able to move around a little bit (&#34;he is surprised that he is still plodding along&#34;), cardiac pacemaker insertion, body weight sometimes increasing, a trouble with his vision, so he has a restricted driver&#39;s license: he can only drive during the day time. The patient is also a hearing aid user from an unknown date and has central nervous system stimulation from an unknown date (&#34;I have Neuraxis&#34;). His wife says that &#34;he has them every day&#34;. Past drug history included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN) used for years as blood thinner. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported, although the patient stated he takes a lot of medications. The patient reported that the vaccine &#34;worked beautifully&#34;, but only after the shot he could read on the information sheet that the he should have told the provider about all his medical conditions, if he has a bleeding disorder or is on a blood thinner. Now he&#39;s reluctant to take his pills because of this warning. He feels fine, he doesn&#39;t have any problems with the shot. He only stated that his arm was little sore but that&#39;s to be expected. The patient would like to know if he can continue to take his blood thinner. On an unknown date the patient underwent lab tests connected with some kind of surgery or his pacemaker whose results were unknown. The action taken with apixaban in response to the event was unknown. The event outcome was unknown at the time of the report.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
