A 90-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL5318), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 31Jan2021 12:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood thinner  (doctor basically wants to thin his blood due to his age and so forth) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, the patient mentioned this to his doctor did want him taking the baby aspirin every day of the week but he told his doctor he bled too much and his doctor &#34;well oh okay&#34;. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) as blood thinner, lisinopril, metoprolol succinate and amlodipine besilate. The patient previously took flu vaccine. The patient received his COVID vaccination around 12:30 Sunday afternoon. He felt fine for the next 2 hours and then he started feeling a little sore and so forth. By evening, the patient was sore and aching all over on 31Jan2021. This is the only side effect he had, everything else went fine. He could hardly get out of bed yesterday because he was so sore all over and it was the same today. The patient stated, &#34;I keep shrinking at this age&#34;. The patient found that when he gets out of bed and forces himself to walk around very carefully, it seems to get a little better. Today, the soreness was down in his abdominal area and the base of his spine. The rest has seemed to clear up. The patient confirmed it has improved some. The doctor did a blood test about two weeks ago prior to the vaccine and it came back excellent in Jan2021. The patient wants to know if it is okay to take Advil or something like that to reduce the pain. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Change in mental status, acute ASSESSMENT/PLAN/DECISION MAKING: Spoke with radiologist informed me that patient had a deep ischemic or infarct change in his corona radiata area which is common in patients with covid 19 infection or vaccination, which patient had a day and a half ago after lengthy discussion with wife, she informed me that patient would not want CPR and he had a stroke in the past and does not want to go to another city as he is 91 years old and therefore not a candidate for thrombolysis and also this was a wakeup stroke and so we do not know his exact time of onset, and she states that they simply want to be treated here for comfort care.

A corticosteroid was given, but did not work. Blisters developed to the point hands had to be dressed.

Blood work was taken and ER DR diagnosed Heart enzymes elevated indicating a heart attack.  Advised additional testing should be done, and that monoclonal antibody treatment wasn&#39;t an option due to time lapse since diagnosis of  COVID,  The option of comfort care was chosen as the treatment plan.

After second vaccination, was not able to stand or move after 36 hrs, at which point he was taken to the hospital. At hospital, all vital signs were good except an MRI showed cancer in spine.  Shot was given 3/1 and my father passed on 3/18.  Obviously this shot did not cause metastatic cancer, but I believe it did induce an inflammatory response of some kind that caused it to progress extremely quickly.

A 92-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL92U3) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included different pills. The patient called and would like to know if his sciatic problem in his left side was related to the Covid vaccine he received. After he got his shot he went down and parked for 15 minutes and then he went to ride home, and when he got out of the car he had sciatic nerve going down his leg on 21Jan2021. He can&#39;t seem to get rid of it and now he was just wondering what would have done that. He felt the pain that goes down his right leg/bum down to his foot, he had a tough time walking on 21Jan2021. Patient was taking different pills and stated, &#34;nothing real serious but this is little bit serious&#34;. Treatment for the events: patient tried different saps and stuffs to put on his leg and he had also taken Tylenol arthritis pill. Outcome of the events was unknown.    No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected. Information regarding the lot/batch number has been obtained.

                                                My father was in weak condition to begin with.  He didn&#39;t get out of bed for the next few days after receiving the vaccine.  The little amount that he ate was consumed in bed.  He began aspirating his food which lead to pneumonia.  He wasn&#39;t strong enough to fight off the pneumonia even with antibiotics.   He died on 1/23/21.   While he might have passed soon in any case, I believe that the vaccine may possibly have increased his weakness/exhaustion thereby hastening his demise.

A 93-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 10Feb2021 at 15:45 (at the age of 93 years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included dementia from an unknown date. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 93 years old) as a single dose in the deltoid right for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. The patient did not have any known allergies. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin and levothyroxine.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 12Feb2021 at 13:30, the patient experienced a seizure and was unresponsive for 20 minutes. Treatment for the events included careful observation and airway protection. The outcome of the events seizure and unresponsive was recovered on an unspecified date in Feb2021. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Seizure and Unresponsive to stimuli cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He got up from the table, notably shuffled the 10 feet to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet before we could &#34;pull down his pants&#34;, and then became non-responsive.

A 95-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient has a hearing and memory problem. He later clarified the main thing is he wanted to know if he can continue with getting the second COVID vaccination. He wanted to continue but wanted to know if these symptoms will prevent him from continuing with getting the COVID vaccination. He confirmed he has no problems around the injection site. However, this is the second day and in Jan2021, he had dizziness. On 11Jan2021, last night he had a very bad headache and fatigue. This morning he is feeling better, but he still has slight dizziness. He is still three weeks away from getting the next vaccine. He wanted to know if he would be able to still take it. He wanted to be immune and to know if there would be any reason why he cannot take the second dose of the vaccine. He then mentioned these symptoms that he is speaking of are general symptoms and he assumed other people have reported them along with him because it is listed on the information sheet. Outcome of the events of dizziness, fatigue and headache was recovering, other events was unknown.    Information about batch/lot number has been requested.
