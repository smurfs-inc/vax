                                                kidneys weren&#39;t acting/kidney issues; not having the feeling to urinate; Light-headed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (reported for herself). A 91-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and blood thinner. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner. The patient is asking if there were any reports of adverse events with kidneys and the vaccine. She received the 1st shot last Thursday (07Jan2021) and told that yesterday (10Jan2021), she had an episode where kidneys weren&#39;t acting. She also mentioned that she is on a blood thinner, ELIQUIS. She is due to receive the 2nd shot on 28Jan2021. She said that she wouldn&#39;t want to receive the 2nd dose if this was related to her adverse reaction. The issue with the kidney started after on 10Jan2021, yesterday she was really having problems, she went to church then came home by that time she would have to go to the bathroom, but she did not go, she ended up cooking dinner which was 3 hours later, she was noticing that she was not urinating. She drank some Gatorade and that made it little better, she is wondering if it&#39;s a side effect. On 10Jan2021, when she noticed the kidney issues, she did not know for certain if it started before that, she didn&#39;t pay attention. Also, yesterday (10Jan2021), she got sick in which she had to grab the counter, she felt bad, she wasn&#39;t dizzy, but felt light-headed. The symptom of not having the feeling to urinate had improved a little today but she is concerned and wanted to know if this was a side effect. Her being light-headed only occurred on 10Jan2021, it was a onetime occurrence yesterday. However, she was also just sitting around, laying around, after that yesterday. The outcome of the event &#39;light-headed&#39; was unknown; while outcome of other events was recovering.

                                                She had the vaccine on Thursday and no visible side effects. On Saturday she was very weak and had to be lowered to the ground. She was drooling and staring vacantly and was not responding to questions. This lasted for a bit. I called the ambulance which took her to the  hospital. They hydrated her and sent her home with no idea what caused it. The next day she was sitting on the toilet and passed out with her eyes closed. She started drooling. I again called the EMTs and they came. She had come to and they said she fainted and it was probably because she was having a bowel movement. This has not happened before or since these two episodes. I do not know if she should get the next shot.

Patient stated that she thinks it was the lymph nodes, she does not know what to do about it, since she is a Cancer survivor. The patient requested the call handler to talk slow, she is 92 years old. She cannot call the doctor because he is retired and so she does not have a doctor. The patient expressed that its especially in the Lymph nodes, she read the papers that she got, she thought this is common. Her First Dose was on 26Jan2021, probably around 9:30AM or 10AM. The Lymph nodes began hurting on 26Jan2021, it was a burning pain on chest and breast area. She took a Vicodin and it went away and did not bother her for the rest of the day, but it was bothering her this morning and it woke her up. She has a lump already on the breast from the surgery and she usually get pain there, but this is not the same pain today. As of reporting time, it was different, it was a stronger pain, it goes down the breast arm. Her Lymph nodes are tender on the Left Side which is the same side she had surgery on in the past. She got the vaccine on the right arm. Outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She said she doesn&#39;t know if her mother will still be able to do that at this time. Reported her mother was checked for a UTI while at the hospital.

The caller stated she did not have any information on the medications her mother has been given while at the hospital. Reported at first she did not think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with her mother&#39;s first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, but then there was a new part to her mother&#39;s story that made her think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine.

                                                My mother died on February 19, 2021. She had her 2nd dose vaccine on 2/11, on 2/12 it was noted that she was not able to walk, on 2/13 she was walking at 30%, on 2/14 she was walking with difficulty, on Monday 2/15 she was throwing up violently and her blood pressure dropped, so she was sent to Clinic. My sister was told she was just constipated and she had A Fib (never reported before to us). My sister was then told on 2/16 early a.m. that she had a blood clot that destroyed her colon. Due to age surgery would likely not be successful. She then died on the Friday. We are reporting in the event that the Pfizer vaccine was somehow a contributing factor to the A fib or to the Clot. She has no history of A fib or clotting prior to this incident. She was 93, and did have dementia, but was able to eat normal foods prior to this. What was unusual was the challenge in walking the day after the shot. Other than that no difference was observed until the day she was admitted to the hospital emergency room. She was a resident at Assisted Living, Memory Care, and that is where she received the vaccine. The mailing address I provided is her mailing address prior to death.

Labs shows, sodium 134, potassium 3.6, bicarb 28, BUN 18, creatinine 0.97, glucose 119, WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 11.8, platelet 239.  PT INR 1.09, COVID negative. CT head suggestive of subacute infarct. Possible including small vessel ischemic changes. Chest xray questionable patchy left retrocardiac atelectasis or pneumonia. EKG shows atrial fibrillation&#39;s heart rate 71, QTc 610.  Case was discussed with neurology in the ED, patient was not a TPA or embolectomy candidate. CT head suggestive of acute/subacute cerebellar infarct.  Patient does not have any residual or sensory deficit except expressive aphasia. Neuro saw patient,  mentioned patient appears to have had a stroke that by the CAT scan criteria is already subacute.  The patient was admitted on the stroke pathway.   The patient has new onset atrial fibrillation and therefore should be considered for anticoagulation.  The patient cannot have an MRI of the brain due to her spinal cord stimulator but given that the stroke is already subacute on the CT without any signs of hemorrhagic conversion she could be started on this at this point.  If she gets started on anticoagulation the aspirin should be stopped. If the patient cannot go on anticoagulation or does not want to then she might be a candidate for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention. 2D echo shows normal ejection fraction of the left ventricle estimated at 70 to 75%.  Regional wall motion abnormality was not observed.  Right ventricle systolic function is normal.  Moderate aortic stenosis. Cardio was consulted for anticoagulation,  From cardioembolic prevention standpoint, anticoagulation is recommended to prevent CVA. However, she has significant risks for bleeding given recent vaginal bleeding (investigation not pursued to spare her comfort), age, comorbidities, etc. Again, further discussion between family and primary team is required regarding risks vs benefits. Was evaluated by speech-language pathology present minimal oral dysphagia no overt clinical signs of aspiration, recommended to continue with NDD 2 diet/thin liquid. Patient was discharged to ECF.

That next morning early, she had a 911 event at her assisted living apartment and was sent back to the hospital, having had another heart attack. Patient died on the following Thursday, February 4, 2021. I do not know if the vaccination had any cause for my mothers death; but I feel it is necessary to report this series of heart attacks after she received the pfizer vaccine.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

                                                I am the discharging physician and did not admit her but based off the information at admit: the patient received her Pfizer vaccine and developed nausea during her observation time but it was not significant enough to cause concern for the family. They took her home in good spirits and she appeared to be doing well until the evening when she became unresponsive. She developed high fevers and came to the ER with low normal O2 saturations and evidence of sepsis. Blood work showed a markedly elevated white count and an elevated lactic acid of 8 along with an elevated renal function and cardiac enzymes without EKG changes (multiorgan failure). Her COVID test was negative.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated no acute findings but likely chronic fecal impaction.  CT Head was negative for bleed or stroke. At this time is is unclear as to what was the cause of her symptoms but we believe it was presumed bacterial sepsis but this diagnosis is in question as all her cultures were unremarkable. The family opted on comfort measures rather than aggressive intervention and she was sent home with hospice.  Since it occurred so closely after receiving the vaccine I think it was worthwhile to bring it to your attention.
