We rushed over and put her feet in the air on a chair and checked her BP and pulse ( 115/70,  71). She didn&#39;t look pale or sweaty or any other symptoms per patients response.  We gave her an ice pack for head and had her lay down for 15mins. I repeated the BP/pulse and still WNL.

The room was stuffy so we moved from the vaccination room to the waiting room but the symptoms (vassalage syncope) seemed to progress so we brought her into the pharmacy where there was enough room for her to lie down.  We had a fan run directly on her &amp; within a few minutes the EMTs were present and they checked her out initially &amp; they decided to bring her to the ambulance &amp; checked her vitals. They asked her mom if she wanted to bring her to the hospital as her vitals were all normal. Mom decided to bring her just in case to make sure everything was okay and get her checked again as a safety precaution/parental concern.

Pt stayed in bed until around 1300 5/16/21.  She had a project for school due- had to video tape making a recipe.  She was standing up videotaping the ingredients when she felt very dizzy. Pt then reported that she lost her vision- everything turned black.  I had to rush to her to catch her- she had loss of consciousness for about a minute.  She was very pale- lips turned blue.  She had a pulse the whole time, BP was 117/60- when I checked it about 5 min later.  Her temperature on a ear thermometer was 99.7.   After she awoke,  she was still very dizzy and stayed in bed most of the day.  5/17/21 AM- she woke up for school 0600- and was feeling better.  No more dizziness, color was back in her cheeks, was able to eat and left for school.

I wiped the area 2 times times and applied pressure for ~1 minutes. Applied a cotton ball under a band-aid. Within 1 min of the vaccine, the pt developed a pump that appeared to be filled with blood under the surface. She stated that the site felt like &#34;when you initially get poked with a needle&#34;. I recommended to take ibuprofen 200-400mg q4-6 hours until the swelling decreases, to apply a cold compress, and call md if worsens.

Eventually heart rate normalized;  took daughter to pediatrician for further evaluation.   Not clear if fainting was related to the vaccine but it has never happened to her before and the timing of the two seems odd.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine at approximately 12pm. Patient felt fine immediately after the vaccination and was instructed to sit and wait for 15 minutes. The immunizer, watched the patient sit down in a chair. A few minutes later the mother of that patient began screaming help, help. Patient had fainted, falling on the floor and hitting her head. I ran our to assist patient, I instructed my technicians to call 911. Patient was on the floor, shaking. I assisted her in rolling over. When she came to I helped her control her breathing and take deep breaths. I used I gauze pad to stop the bleeding on her head. I made sure she was lying flat on the floor. We gave her an ice pack to help with the numbness and tingling in her hands. The paramedics arrived and took patient to the hospital.

After she came to we helped her to a chair and sat her down, advised her to put her head between her knees, and got her some water that she requested.  After a few minutes she appeared rather pale and went to ask her if she was ok and she asked for a trash can because she felt like she was going to be sick.  We gave her a garbage bag and she did get sick in the garbage bag.  We kept an eye on her for another 15-20 minutes and she stated that she felt better and that she thought she was ok to leave.   We offered her help to her car but she denied it saying she would be ok with she walked slowly.  Her father was with her the entire time.  While talking with them the father did state that she had incidents like that in the past where she stood up too fast and got light headed and passed out.
