We rushed over and put her feet in the air on a chair and checked her BP and pulse ( 115/70,  71). She didn&#39;t look pale or sweaty or any other symptoms per patients response.  We gave her an ice pack for head and had her lay down for 15mins. I repeated the BP/pulse and still WNL.

                                                Patient was given vaccine and felt fine right after. After awhile a customer came back and alerted the pharmacy that she had fainted and was in one of the aisles with her mom. she did not injure herself in the fall. We had her lay on the floor and took her blood pressure which was slightly low. We had her stay laying down until she felt better and her blood pressure increased. After about 25 more minutes she felt well enough to leave the store with her mom.

                                                My daughter is experiencing periodically nose bleeds, brain fog and bit distracted and losing herself in her thoughts after her first dose  Pfizer vaccine. This is new from the initial report. Her mother also states she feels fatigue and not active for a few days now.  At this time I have not been able to get an appointment to see her doctor and I am very concerned about her symptoms.   I would like more research or documentation to be released about this type of group to figure out why this happened to her. Also, I would like to see if they are going to be monitored after her vaccine. I do not know what other side effects will be coming after her vaccine and I am concerned.

This consumer (mother) reported for a 12-year-old female patient (daughter) that. A 12-years-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0185),via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 18May2021 17:00 as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 18May2021 the patient experienced clear fluid was accompanied with some blood thereafter, some of the vaccine leaked out of her arm, some of the vaccine leaked out of her arm and held the needle too long at the arm. Caller called for her 12 year old daughter who received her 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine yesterday at 5:00pm MST at a Pharmacy. She mentioned that 5 out of 6 of them in the family were over 16 years old and had no problem with their vaccination as they received it at a different Pharmacy branch. She mentioned that the branch she went to yesterday for her daughter was very unorganized. The vaccination was held at a drive-thru in which she noticed that the Pharmacy Technician held the syringe too long on her daughters arm and when he pulled out, some clear fluid flowed out and ran down her arm and she started bleeding. She already went up to the Pharmacist and they mentioned that they will call Pfizer within the week. She is called for herself just to make sure and seeked recommendations for events such as these because she is doubtful that her daughter even got enough of the 1st shot. She is wondered if she should restart the dose, how long should she wait if she restarts, or just proceed with the 2nd dose. Consumer called about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who reports her 12 year old daughter supposedly received her first dose yesterday at a pharmacy at 05:00PM MST. Agent reports that caller also mentioned that 5 people in their family above the age of 16 received doses at another pharmacy and had no problems, but her daughter who took her first dose yesterday at a drive thru of a pharmacy had a problem. Agent reported caller said that yesterday the tech who administered the first dose held the needle too long at the arm and when they pulled it out some of the vaccine went out, some clear fluid leaked out of her daughter&#39;s arm, and was accompanied with some blood thereafter. Agent reported that caller was advised to consult their physician and let them know Pfizer Medical Information&#39;s number so they can contact and discuss options. Caller said she would say that she was not very far from her daughter&#39;s arm when it happened since she was sitting next to her. She said she saw a fat drop of clear liquid run down her daughter&#39;s arm, and then after that came down, after it came a drop of blood that leaked down into it, so that it was clear at first then became pinkish. She said the person who gave the injection to her daughter had to grab something to wipe it because it was traveling down her arm. Caller said that there was no treatment done to her daughter&#39;s arm other than when he wiped it off and slapped a band aid on it, and then he didn&#39;t make eye contact with her and didn&#39;t want to talk about it. She understood that things like this can and do happen sometimes. She said she should have taken her daughter to a doctor but she didn&#39;t. Said her daughter did not have any other vaccinations yesterday or any other vaccinations in the last four weeks. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown. Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

About 2 minutes after receiving the shot she lost consciousness and pharmacy staff called 911 for EMTs. She regained consciousness approximately 1 minute later; stated she was a little short of breath. Pharmacist asked her to state her name (was coherent and aware) and asked her to take a breath normally; she was able to do so and could breathe normally with no difficulty. Her father laid her on the floor because she was still light-headed, but could breathe normally. EMT arrived very shortly after and began taking her pulse, checking her pulse-ox, and blood pressure. Pulse was on lower end, blood pressure was around 80/50, pulse ox normal. She was taken to ER per her father&#39;s request for further examination.

Doctors.  &gt;reached over 110%  immunity if not more.  &gt; Both Hematologist I spoke with plus the E.R. doctors determined she was at 100% immunity with just the first dose. &gt; Due to her reaction her Oncologist/Hematologist are communicating with other hematologist in the U.S.  about a reaction of a ?12 year old pediatric patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis?, further research will begin according to the Director of Onoccologist/Hematologist in the next few weeks to help other pediatric patients with Heriditary Spherocytosis in the U.S., the main point of this research is determining that one dose of Covid vaccine reaches 100% immunity vs 2 doses which would be equivalent to ?2 doses plus 2 booster shots of Covid vaccine? to someone with hereditary spherocytosis.  &gt;  &gt; After 8 hours of going through this, she was able to walk and stand. She was back to her old self.  &gt; If you can please reach out to CDC and let them know about a 12 year olds patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis  reaction to second dose of Phizer Vaccine.

                                                The night of the vaccine, towards the middle of the night she had a fever 103.2; little bit of a headache. Her fever went down through the night. In a.m., she was at 100 degrees. She started shaking and fainted when getting ready to go downstairs; Pulsometer - 147 for heart rate. She shook just a little. I thought she was going to have a seizure and I yelled for my husband and she regained consciousness. She hasn&#39;t had a fever since but we can&#39;t keep her heart rate down -it shoots up from 130- to low 150&#39;s. Still like that today. we took her to Dr. - he said it was reaction to vaccine. He referred her to cardiologist with an urgent designation. She&#39;s never had nay problems like this before. She will see cardiologist tomorrow. Rest and hydration is the current treatment. It hasn&#39;t gone away in the two or three days that they thought it would.

We elevated her legs and gave her a cold pack for her neck and wrists. After watching her for about 30 minutes she felt better and left with her mother.

She also was coughing a very shallow, tight cough that was triggered by trying to take a deep breath. She rated the chest tightness a 7/10. By bedtime, fever down to 100.1 without any medication. Gave one ibuprofen for chest tightness. The next morning she was feeling much better and said she could barely feel chest tightness. As day progressed and over next several days, the symptom would come back, but was mild. Pediatrician saw her on 6/4 - no abnormal findings. Due to lingering , though mild symptoms over weekend, pediatrician made referral for cardiologist. Cardiologist performed EKG on 6/9 and results normal.

An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

Mom reported to pharmacist staff that patient turned pale and felt dizzy. Pharmacist suggested patient to drink water and continued to rest while pharmacist monitored patient. Pharmacist tried to take patient&#39;s blood pressure but pharmacy didn&#39;t have the right cuff so she was  unable to obtain patient&#39;s blood pressure. Patient then was sweating and mom continued to give her water while pharmacist checked patient&#39;s temperature (recorded 94.6&#39;F). Few minutes later, patient vomited. Mom gave patient water after she was done vomiting. Patient reported she felt better afterwards. Patient was monitored for about 15 minutes and she was able to walk herself and left the pharmacy waiting area with mother. Pharmacist suggested mother to call doctor for follow up advice.

Her mother and I both tried to lean here back in the chair she was sitting in.  she jolted a few times and her eyes rolled backwards. I asked her mother if she has ever had seizures, she responded no.  Her mother stabilized her and I ran to get the NP next door, by the time we returned she had regained consciousness, but was a little confused and very pale.  The NP checked her out and found out she did not eat breakfast.  We gave her some apple juice.  After 15-20 minutes her color had come back, she felt fine, and she was able to leave.  Her mother told me later that both patient and her mother have had syncope events in the past.

She laid on the floor for about 15 minutes and then waited another 15 minutes after that and was feeling fine after that and she went home with her mom.

After 5 minutes she wanted to sit up and she sat in a chair and passed out again.  911 was called at that point.  We had her on the floor after that until the paramedics arrived.  They retook her bp and it was 111/63.  They checked her vitals and decided to take her to the ambulance just to give more privacy and have their equipment more readily available.

                                                Patient was a 12 year old female with a weight of 94 lbs who came into the clinic with her father for her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. During the interview, she stated that she did not have any adverse effects with her first dose. At 2:45 pm, after administering her second dose of 0.3 ml of Pfizer vaccine, I witnessed her having trouble standing up and assisted her back down into the seat. She vomited, was pale and diaphoretic. We elevated her legs up onto a bench and began fluid resuscitation. Her first BP was 71/55 and respiratory rate was unlabored. At 3:00 pm her second vitals were BP: 82/69, RR: unlabored, SPO2: 98, HR: 80.  At 3:07 pm her third vitals were BP:83/64, RR: unlabored, SPO2: 99, HR:74. We changed her position from legs elevated to 90 degree angle. Fluids and crackers were still being administered. At 3:16 pm her fourth vitals were BP: 94/76, RR; unlabored, SPO2: 85, HR 67.  At 3:30 pm her final vital signs were BP: 96/74, RR: 14, SPO2: 99, HR: 70. The patient was given a total of 60 oz of fluid and 1 pack of crackers.  I reassessed that the patient&#39;s hemodynamic status improved and her skin was warm and dry. The patient was alert and oriented throughout the process. Her father stated that she no longer looked pale. She was brought to the observation room for another 15 minutes and her father was informed about the progression of her condition. He was informed to refer to her pediatrician if there were any other adverse effects related to the vaccine or changes in her condition.

                                                Patient received her 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine around 11:20am, and started feeling bad within about 5-7 minutes of administration.  Her grandmother came to the counter to alert me that she wasn&#39;t feeling well, patient was lightheaded and just &#34;felt bad&#34;.  She did say she was nauseous, but was very agitated and had trouble verbalizing what was wrong.  She was very hot and clammy, her mother reported that she looked very pale.  I went to get a cuff to take her blood pressure, but by the time I got it on her arm, she was slumping significantly in the chair, so we decided to move her back to the clinic room to lay her down and elevate her feet.  Her mother and I each took an arm to move her.  I thought she may have briefly lost consciousness, her legs were not holding any of her weight, but her head was down, so I couldn&#39;t tell if she was alert.  We moved her a few more feet into the room and her mother moved to set her down in a chair, she was talking and alert.  At this time, her bladder evacuated and she vomited, her mom moved her the rest of the way to the chair. I immediately went back to the room with them and dialed 911 at 11:34am.  She was more alert at this time, did not report any difficulty breathing or any swelling or itching of the mouth or throat.  She was very anxious/agitated, but she did say that she felt a little better after vomiting.   EMS arrived at 11:52, I believe she vomited again before they got here, she did take a few sips of water.  EMS left at 12:06pm, the patient and her mother left at 12:07, she was walking on her own, with support from mom.

Shortly later she went to purchase something at the front cashier of the store and started to faint. Her mother was behind her to catch her so she didn&#39;t hit her head but they both fell to the floor. A customer in line called Paramedics. Patient&#39;s mom claimed she only sat for 5-10 minutes because she thought she would be fine. Paramedics arrived a few minutes later and checked the patient&#39;s vitals. BP, oxygen levels and HR were normal according to the paramedic but blood sugar level was 72 which was low. The Paramedics told patient to sit, have a snack and stay for at least 15 more minutes and then call a ride to take them home because they walked. Patient agreed because was feeling better. 15 minutes later I checked on patient to make sure she was feeling ok and she said she was feeling better and that they were getting their ride to go home.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                The day after my daughter received her vaccine, she began to feel congested and tired. This was on Sunday, May 23. We got up for school on Monday, May 24, but she was complaining about a really bad sore throat. The school nurse called and I picked her up from school because she was also getting more congested. She began to cough and sneeze constantly and took a long nap. When she woke, she was saying that she was getting short of breath and it felt like her heart was racing, even though she was just sitting. The next day her throat felt better, but the congestion was the same - still coughing and sneezing but her shortness of breath started getting more obvious. I emailed her pediatrician to ask about bringing her in, and they said to report this to the CDC and bring her if if she&#39;s not better in the next few days. Today is Wednesday, May 26 and she is still congested, short of breath and overall feels lousy. She is coughing up lots of mucus - greenish and thick. Yuck. I just gave her one pill of a mucus reducer to see if that would help. My biggest worry is about the shortness of breath because that is exactly what I experienced after my first dose of the vaccine. Mine was Moderna and I have seen dr&#39;s about it - and actually ended up in the hospital, but they do not believe it to be connected to the vaccine. I will contact them and let them know about my daughter&#39;s shortness of breath and perhaps they will think differently. Oh, she&#39;s had a slight fever of 99 F on occasions during this.

Her blood pressure was normal and she was kept under watch for 20-25 mins after receiving the vaccine and she left the clinic  after we observed her for 20-25 mins and she was doing absolutely fine.   Followed up with the parent on Wednesday 5/26/21 at around 7:45pm. Mother reported patient is doing absolutely fine. I told patient&#39;s mom, fainting can be caused due to nervousness and drop in oxygen levels to the brain. However, this adverse effect will be reported to patients doctor and also to the VAERS for Pfizer covid-19 vaccine.

                                                Before I administered the vaccine, the mother stated that she sometimes has an issue with fainting, but mainly at the doctor&#39;s office out of fear.  She assumed that since this was a different environment, she would be okay.  After giving  her the shot , she fainted.  The mom called 911.  I waved  an ammonia inhalant under her nose, and she was revived.  Her twin brother informed me that she has been in an ambulance 4 times prior after getting shots.  Had I known she had a history of fainting, I would have suggested that she receive the vaccine at the pediatrician&#39;s  office once it becomes available. The mom refused to go to the hospital once paramedics arrived. She sat for 15 minutes, I applied a cool cloth, she  drank water and was able to walk out on her own.

He reports that she fainted but had some seizure-type activity, but minimalized. She was monitored by both RN and myself. She was lowered to the floor to lay on the floor, was fanned, and her BP and pulse were monitored by RN. She was accompanied by her mother, and her mother declined having EMS contacted. Once patient regained consciousness, she was alert, laughed and talked to us, and regained a sitting position. We then gave her cold water to drink, and she was able to get up into a chair. After sitting for several minutes, she was able to walk out of the room and into one of our monitoring cubicles for an extended monitoring timeframe. We kept her here for 30 minutes for further observation, then left accompanied by her mother. Due to RN&#39;s report of the seizure-type activity, mom is going to contact patient&#39;s pediatrician to see if further treatment is needed.

                                                Prior to the vaccine patient and parent were given teaching about concerns for fainting.  She was questioned if she had something to eat and drink prior to coming to the clinic and both indicated that she had.  It was volunteered that patient has never had a fainting spell from receiving injections/vaccines.  She was administered 0.3 ml of the Pfizer vaccine at 4:47 p.m. while seated securely in a chair.  At about 4:50 p.m. she lost consciousness and assumed a prone position.  She was held by both the R.N. and her mother and never fell or injured herself.  She was unconscious for approximately 8-10 seconds and regained consciousness.  She was alert and oriented.  She was reassured and given some apple juice and a graham cracker which she consumed.  Charge nurse and nurse manager appeared on the scene.  EMT was summoned who brought a wheel chair and patient was transported to the observation area in the wheel chair.  She was conversing and appeared oriented prior to going to the observation area.

                                                On 05-22-2021, participant&#39;s mother states her daughter pain started at about 1:00AM. I took her to Urgent care because she was having chest pain, nausea and headaches. She also had 99.2F of fever but no congestion or cough.  At the ER an EKG was done and it was a bit off, lab work was also performed, x-ray of the chest was also done and they gave her an Albuterol treatment. She was given IV fluids and steroids and a CT scan of the chest was also performed. After 9 hours, she was discharged home and could not find anything wrong. On 05-25-2021 I took her to her pediatrician who pushed on her chest and it hurt her when he did this, her pain level was between 5 and 8 out of 10 on VAS scale. EKG&#39;s were performed as well as lab work, x-ray of the chest at the pediatrician office. Her daughter also said her chest hurt her to exhale and inhale.  The pediatrician said that her rib cage and breast bone where inflamed upon pressing on her daughter&#39;s chest and that she has s costochondritis. As of today my daughter still has nausea that comes and goes and also continues with the headaches and takes Ibuprofen as pain medication.

So I went out with my daughter at 3:00 p.m. She and stood in line at clothing store after walking for an hour and a half and then suddenly she felt dizziness and 20 seconds later she lost consciousness. And then she woke up a minutes later while an employee called 911. She was fine and felt well but when we came back to our house, she was tired and slept 15 minute in my car. The next day, my daughter was fine, but after dinner we walk out near my house after 10 minutes she felt dizziness again.  She sat there for 10 minutes and she was fine. After that day, there were no symptoms.

                                                Patient fainted in the bathroom around 2:00am.  When we heard the thump, we ran to her and my husband picked her up.    She wasn&#39;t talking much, she started gagging and fainted again and her body started convulsing.  We believe she was having a seizure.  Patient has never had a seizure, her fever was high.  It only lasted probably 20-30 seconds.  When she stopped, she was able to walk with assistance back to her room.  We quickly gave her some medicine to bring down her fever.  Wet wash cloth and a fan on her.  I failed to take her temperature.  I was too concerned at what was going on.

She gets nosebleeds here and there, but we have never seen blood with this consistency coming out of her before. It was pretty strange and alarming.  She just sat and pinched the bridge of her nose until the bleeding stopped. She had one more minor nosebleed while on a walk that evening, but not of the same magnitude.

On Sunday morning, I gave her two Ibuprofen around 9 because her arm was still hurting. Around 9:30, she came in saying she was having chest pains and her pulse rate was over 120. I took her to the ER. Her heart rate was 128 when they triaged her. They gave her an IV and a saline drip, an EKG and chest x-ray, all of which were fine. Due to her being on birth control, they also did a d-dimer test, which was elevated at 442. They then did a lung scan to rule out a pulmonary embolism. Those results were negative as well. The chest pains resolved around 11 am. Since they ruled out the blood clot and nothing was found to be wrong with her heart, she was sent home. They figured that she maybe had an anxiety attack or heart palpations. I took her to her pediatrician the next day and she was cleared there as well.

She never gets nosebleeds, so I took her into the Dr. to have labs done, just to make sure her platelet count was good. All tests came back normal. We are on day 3 after her 2nd Pfizer, and she has not had a nosebleed yet today, so I&#39;m hopeful it&#39;s resolved. In addition to the nosebleed on day 2, she was exhausted, had a headache and had a low grade fever. These I expected, but not the nosebleeds.

Pt did complain of getting dizzy when standing up, but we did not think was related. We thought it was from her methotrexate. Pt received her second dose on June 6. On June 7, Pt had chest pain, tachycardia, and did not feel right. We went to Hospital. Pt was admitted because of the high pulse rate and nausea and vomiting. It appears that the vaccine triggered POTS.  This is an update to my report that I filled out in the hospital a few days ago

We gave her a granola bar and some water before the injection, as a preventative measure. She fainted a second time. Mom checker her BP and patient felt nauseous. She started jerking and 911 was called. EMTs said it was not a seizure, but a vasovagal jerk. Paramedics said to lay the person down after the patient started jerking. When she was stable enough to be moved, EMTs wheeled her to the door of the store.

SHE DID NOT HIT HER HEAD.  I WAS INFORMED SHE FAINTED.  WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE TO CHECK ON HER, HER MOTHER STATED SHE THAT PATIENT HAD NOT EATEN THAT MORNING AND WAS VERY NERVOUS.  THE MANAGER ON DUTY CALLED 911.  I RAN BACK IN AND GRABBED A BOTTLE OF WATER FOR HER AND A BOTTLE OF ORANGE JUICE.  THE PATIENT WAS SITTING UP AND CONSCIOUS. MANAGER STAYED WITH HER UNTIL 911 ARRIVED.  THE PARAMEDICS EXAMINED THE PATIENT AND THE PATIENT WAS RELEASED TO LEAVE WITH HER MOTHER.  I CALLED THE PATIENT&#39;S MOTHER SEVERAL HOURS LATER.  THE PATIENT WAS FEELING MUCH BETTER AFTER EATING SOMETHING.  I ADVISED THE FAMILY TO CALL US WITH ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.

                                                On day 3 after the second dose, she began to develop a rash on her face and arms around 8 pm. This progressed over the next several hours to the next morning to include swelling of the face and neck, tightness of the throat and chest, and progression of the rash to involve all of the arms, chest, and legs. The rash was a fine maculopapular rash that was itchy. Over the next 3 days the symptoms did not progress further, but they also did not subside. On day 7 after the 2nd dose, she was placed on a Medrol Dose pack. The swelling of the face and sensation of tight throat began to ease by the next day. After completion of the steroid regimen, her skin is dry and flaky with mild tightness in the skin of the face. However, most of the rash has gone and the tightness in the throat is absent.

                                                13 year old female received#2 Pfizer vaccine and within 5-10 minutes after her vaccine she was sitting in post observation with her father when one of our employees called over to me that she was fainting. I ran over to the girl and she had passed out-she was sitting in the chair and did not fall. She was breathing with a pulse of 77- her color was pasty and she was not responding verbally. She was very limp and did not awake after multiple attempts with  ammonia inhalant, calling her name and rubbing her chest. 911 was called immediately and female was transported to  Hospital within in 20 minutes of incident.  I spoke with her stepmom and she informed me that she was sleeping now and is doing ok.   They did blood work at the hospital and did not find any issues. Step mom states it took 1 1/2 hours for her color to return. She did tell me that stepdaughter has had syncope issues before and is on antidepressant med that may have caused this. We were not aware of this during time of vaccination.

The room was stuffy so we moved from the vaccination room to the waiting room but the symptoms (vassalage syncope) seemed to progress so we brought her into the pharmacy where there was enough room for her to lie down.  We had a fan run directly on her &amp; within a few minutes the EMTs were present and they checked her out initially &amp; they decided to bring her to the ambulance &amp; checked her vitals. They asked her mom if she wanted to bring her to the hospital as her vitals were all normal. Mom decided to bring her just in case to make sure everything was okay and get her checked again as a safety precaution/parental concern.

The patient&#39;s mother went to get orange juice.   She was pale and her eyes were rolling back in her head.  She did pass out for a few seconds, and I checked the patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure.  BP 139/58, pulse 53.  By that point she was coming back around.  After she sat for several minutes and had orange juice and water, she was feeling much better.

I wiped the area 2 times times and applied pressure for ~1 minutes. Applied a cotton ball under a band-aid. Within 1 min of the vaccine, the pt developed a pump that appeared to be filled with blood under the surface. She stated that the site felt like &#34;when you initially get poked with a needle&#34;. I recommended to take ibuprofen 200-400mg q4-6 hours until the swelling decreases, to apply a cold compress, and call md if worsens.

                                                Daughter fainted 20 hours after vaccine.  Was treated by school nurse who observed elevated heart rate (150 bpm).   Eventually heart rate normalized;  took daughter to pediatrician for further evaluation.   Not clear if fainting was related to the vaccine but it has never happened to her before and the timing of the two seems odd.

The nurse from her school helped her to stop it but it was pretty bad. This is very unusual for her and the amount of blood was not like a typical bloody nose. It was all over her the front of her sweatshirt.

                                                Patient was administered the first Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine per protocol and was seated for observation post administration.  She became faint.  Pharmacy staff  broke an ammonia inhalant to help the patient recover.  She responded quickly, but did require additional whiffs later.  When questioned, she stated that she was having no difficulty breathing, swelling in throat,  and no obvious rash.  She was accompanied by her mother, who  declined emergency medical care/911 assistance.  The patient was not wearing constrictive clothing, so no adjustments were necessary, but she did recline further in the chair.  She was also provided with cool, wet, paper towels for her forehead and neck.  When she was feeling better, she had a few sips of water.  Although offered a motorized cart to leave the store, she left with both parents walking with no assistance.  On 5/20/21 we reached out to the family and spoke with her father.  The patient did have a minor  headache the evening of her vaccine administration, which has resolved.  She does have a sore arm, which is a common side effect of the vaccine,  Her father has reached out to her pediatrician to see whether she should get the second dose or not.  He has not yet received a response.

Her eyes rolled into the back of her head; she then leaned over the right arm of the chair.  Her body stiffened next. I held her head and body with the help of a colleague.  This happened for about 10 seconds, then she woke up and snatched her mask off with a confused look on her face.  We asked her questions to see if she was aware. She was, then she went back out falling over to the side.  I called 911. When she awakened the second time after about 7-10 seconds her face turned pale.  We then moved her to the floor and propped her feet up.  Patient said she was nervous and felt like she had to use the restroom.  Her skin was clamy; patient said clamy skin is nothing new for her.  The fire truck and ambulance arrived on scene.  The workers began to assess patient.  Vitals were good. She did not go in the ambulance, but stated her vision were blurry.  She went home with grandparents.

                                                I administered the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to the patient (14 year old) she was very anxious, after giving it to her she sat in the post-IMZ waiting area on the chair. Her mother was next to her. In a few minutes she told her mother she was feeling dizzy and started to fall off the chair. Her mother caught her and yelled to us for help. We called code white and 911. She  recovered in a few minutes and he gave her an ice pak as she was hot. She sat on the floor with her mother. She stood up after she felt better and sat on the chair and then she got pale again and looked like she was about to faint again. The fire department had arrived and they checked on her. By then she was a lot better. They decided that it was not necessary to call an ambulance and went home. We gave her a bottle of water. I followed up with the mother at 7 pm and she was doing a lot better

Upon my immediate arrival, I tapped the patient and she was coming to consciousness. Patient upon awakening, felt nauseous and wanted to vomit, but barely did. I gave the patient water and sports drink and the patient was regaining normalcy. Both the patient and her guardian reported that she did not eat or drink anything prior to coming to the vaccine appointment and that she was very nervous and worried prior. Patient denied history of fainting. I recommended to have the patient sit for at least another 15-20 minutes, but the parent stated his daughter was fine and decided to leave.

                                                Patient developed dizziness and coldness in extremities. She tried walking and fell down, but did not lose consciousness. She then alternated between feeling hot and cold and seeing &#34;blurry spots&#34;. I noticed her lips turning white and she said she needed to lie down. I got her water and ice packs since she was sweating. We sat on the floor for about 10 minutes, then she was able to move to a chair for another 5-10minutes and then left the facility. Mom reports that she has been lethargic and napping most of the day. Patient ate a few cheez-its for breakfast and reports that she did not get a good nights sleep last night.

She answered all questions that we asked of her correctly (such as her name, her age, etc.) Paramedics arrived, took her blood pressure, oxygen level (both normal), blood sugar (normal). Parents decided to take her to hospital for further evaluation.  I called and spoke to Dad 5 hours later, dad stated that she is doing fine.

She was sitting up in a chair during this time, with her mom holding her up.  She came to, the about 20 seconds later, she passed out again for another 10 seconds.  She came to, and was given some water to drink, but 20 seconds after that she threw up the water.  I took her blood pressure, and it was 60/40, with a pulse of 60.  She was very pale.  After resting in the chair and taking deep breaths, her color returned and she felt much better.  she also said her vision wasn&#39;t blurry anymore.  Ten minutes later, she left with her mom, feeling ok.  She was very anxious about getting the shot, and told me she had passed out in the pass after giving blood.

                                                Patient came in with her father to get 2nd Pfizer vaccine. Patient stated with the first shot, she felt a little dizzy but then it went away. Her father said she was nervous/anxious to get this vaccine. Patient got the vaccine first, then sat in the observation chair while her father got his vaccine. While her father got the vaccine, I checked on her and she said she felt a little dizzy. Patient agreed to put paper towel on back of neck and wrists. As soon as her father finished his vaccine, we moved her to the immunization room to monitor her (such as blood pressure - readings given to paramedics.) Her heart rate was a little high (I believe 107), then  went back to normal. However then her blood pressure started getting lower (around 80/40s) and began feeling worse. Laid patient down with feet elevated and called 911. By the time ambulance arrived, her blood pressure was starting  to improve. Her father agreed with ambulance to bring her in to get checked out.

                                                She was not feeling well when she got up on Saturday morning. We went to the neighbors house and were outside for maybe 15 minutes (it was a warm day) when she passed out momentarily. We immediately got her some water and got her in the AC and she did fine since then. She did have mild finger swelling on the distal joint of both index fingers after the first injection on 5/14/2021(same lot #). We are not sure if the finger swelling was related to the vaccine. It started about 5 days after first vaccine.

                                                My daughter was receiving her second vaccine about 1230pm  and while administered she immediately told me she felt ?dizzy and nauseous.? We sit down, she is not feeling better and within 3 minutes or so she said she felt? dizzy and feel like I?m going to throw up.? She then starts nodding off and on, not able to keep her eyes open. I waved over for help and by the time volunteers got to her she went limo and passes out. She was taken by wheelchair to medic room and they had her lay down. She came alert and said ?everything went black? and had no memory/recollection or awareness of where she was and how she got to the medic room. We gave her water and I asked for crackers and she felt better and was able to leave around 115pm.  In addition, we saw a teenage male pass out prior to my daughter and was also taken by wheelchair. I spoke with a RN as I was leaving and was told multiple teens had had the same initial reaction today.  She had no reactions or side effects with her first dose.

She sat down, told her mom that she felt dizzy and then her head fell backwards while she was sitting in the chair.  A moment later, she picked her head up and called for her mom.  Pharmacy personnel immediately went out to see what was happening.  Mom said to call 911 so the pharmacy technician called 911 and sat with the patient until EMS arrived. Patient was talking and still sitting in her chair when EMS arrived and she was taken by EMS to the hospital.  We contacted her father by cell phone a couple of hours later and he said that she was having tests done.

We gave her some glucose tablets and she seemed to get better afterwards.  I did a pulse oximeter on her her and her pulse and oxygen was normal.  I offered mother if she wanted me to call 911 and she said no.  I counseled mother and the girl to monitor how she is feeling and to seek 911 or urgent care if she gets worst throughout the day.  The girl left the store feeling okay.

                                                Starting early morning  after vaccine, approximately 15 hours after vaccine, patient developed severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. Her fever was high throughout the day (often 102.8 even after Tylenol and Ibuprofen).  I am a physician and my husband is as well, we monitored her heart rate, oxygenation, temperature, and symptoms at home. We called her doctor and asked whether this could be myocarditis and whether we should go to the ER. She felt that we should just have her rest and monitor her vitals. I dosed her with two large doses of Ibuprofen (600 mg twice during the day), and by 6 pm on 6/4 her chest pain started to improve and her fever broke. The severe crushing chest pain lasted about 12 hours.

We cleared the area and put ice packs on her forehead and behind her neck and put some fragrance in front of her to smell which woke her up. Once she woke up her dad lifted her back into the consultation room and we had her lay down and put her feet on a chair. She was lying down for about 10 minutes then we gave her gatorade and she said she felt better. Once she got up, I asked her to remain seated in our waiting for another 15 minutes before leaving.

She was out for 2minutes at the most Mother got her up and made her drink a lot of water.  She continued to feel bad. Temp was close to 102.  Around 5pm that evening she was feeling better.  So this report is because of a syncopal episode about 19 1/2 hours after the Covid Pfizer vaccine #2.

A contactable consumer (mother) reported that a 14-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Jun2021 (Batch/Lot number was reported as EW &#39;O or 0&#39; 186) at the age of 14-years-old as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. No family medical history of seizure. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on an unknown date at Arm Left for covid-19 immunisation. The reason for the transfer today (03Jun2021) was that her 14 year old daughter immediately after getting her second dose of the COVID vaccine started shaking, experiencing fever and fallen unconscious and collapsed and was taken to the hospital and she wanted to go ahead and report those adverse side effects for her. She (patient) was 14 year old and she got her second vaccination today and few minutes after she got it, she stood up and she said she was not feeling well and then the next thing reporter knew like her eyes go back, she do not seem conscious and she was shaking as if, looks like she was having a seizure and then she fell down and she was not conscious, so she fell down, she is still twitching. She has no history of like seizures but that is like twisting and now she was taken to the hospital. So, the hospital treated her as if she had a concussion. Reporter have reported to them that she looks like it was a seizure before she fell down, into her head. Reporter further stated &#34;That day was her second shot and like I said she stood up, she got up from that, she said that she got funny and that I can see where she just kind of lost consciousness, eyes going back, shaking as if she was having seizures and then she fell down and she was unconscious and she is like still moving as if she is having a seizure and she was taken. Reporter stated, &#34;it was a like a seizure but it is like over and she had concussion like falling on the ground but it appears like a seizure, that was a immediate thing.&#34; For treatment, reporter stated that &#34;Any treatment, No. She was taken to the hospital and the hospital needs to write it down and I don&#39;t understand that, the hospital wrote down concussion but the hospital they took the vital signs and she had low blood pressure.&#34; For the date when patient went to the hospital, reporter stated &#34;That was today, June 3rd and she is discharged. The reason she was taken was potential seizure and it was concussion and it was after she fell, she passed out and had low blood pressure. The outcome of the events was unknown. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

After waiting 30 minutes, the mother (who was shopping) retrieved child who was sitting in the pharmacy waiting area post vaccination. After 5 more mins, another customer got the RPH attention explaining the patient was passing out. The mother assisted patient to the pharmacy waiting area, in which the patient was given chairs to sit on and put feet up. Another shopper who said she was an ER nurse told the pharmacy staff to have the patient lay down across the chairs then left. The patient was weak, cold, clammy, and pale. The patient then told the pharmacist that she had left her mother at the check out section, went upstairs, used the bathroom, was coming down the stairs when her vision started to have black spots. She reached her mother when she said she didn&#39;t feel good and started to pass out. The mother stated she caught her daughter. At this point, the RPH initiated a 911 call.  She called out for the technician to call the store managers for assistance and take over the 911 call. The RPh then stayed with the patient and the mother. The tech gave the mother a bottle of water for the pt. The store managers arrived at the scene and also assisted.  The patient stated she was feeling a lot better after she laid down for a little bit. The RPh notice color coming back into the patient&#39;s lips and face.  The patient stated that the adverse effects didn&#39;t start until she was walking down the stairs. After 10-15 mins, the Paramedics arrived and further assisted the patient and her mother. The paramedics took the patient via stretcher to the ambulance for further treatment around 12:55pm.

Pediatrician evaluated patient and ordered chest X-ray which was normal. Pediatrician referred us to ER for further evaluation. At the ER they did blood work, EKG, urinalysis. EKG was normal. Labs came back showing elevated D Dimer so they ordered a CT scan of her chest which came back normal. They also ordered a coagulation profile which came back normal. We were released from the ER and told to monitor if symptoms continued. She had no symptoms of shortness of breath or palpitations while at the ER. As of today she continues to have very short episodes of palpitations but has not had shortness of breath.

                                                6/19/21 patient awoke with non-bloody, bright green emesis and abdominal pain. She endorses several episodes of nonbloody diarrhea with continued abdominal pain.  She endorses starting her menstrual period 3 days ago. Mom endorses fever at this time, T-max 102.9.  Presented to an urgent care for further evaluation where they obtained a rapid strep test and COVID-19 swab that were both negative. 6/21/21 she presented to an ED for continued and worsening symptoms.  She received a dose of antibiotics and saline boluses during transfer to another hospital.  In route, she became hypotensive with minimal response to fluid resuscitation. She required vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. A CT of the abdomen showed nonspecific findings for enterocolitis.  A urinalysis had 5-15 RBCs and 51-100 WBCs. She was started on antibiotics. She required ICU admission initially, but improved and became hemodynamically stable after about 16 hours in the PICU. Her urine culture grew 3 different organisms with low colony counts so antibiotics were discontinued on 6/22/21. An ECHO demonstrated normal biventricular size and systolic function (LFEF 62%), mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating mildly elevated RV pressure (30-40% systemic), mild flow accelration across normal appearing trileaflet aortic valve and borderline small aortic root and sinotubular junction, normal ascending aorta, no pericardial effusion, normal right, left main, and LAD coronary artery diameter z-score, and mild outpouching in the left main coronary artery that may represent an early appearance of an aneurysm. A repeat ECHO the following day revealed normal biventricular size and systolic function, mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating RV systolic pressure of 30mmHg, left main coronary artery appears slightly prominent but measures within normal limits. LMCA measurement is similar to previous, normal measurement of the proximal RCA and LAD, and trivial pericardial effusion. The patient also had an elevated CRP of 18.8 mg/dL, fibrinogen of 408 mg/dL, d-dimer of 0.98, and nt-pro BNP of 309. SARS CoV2 IgG was positive and IgM was negative. She received IVIG 100 gm on 6/23/21 and was started on rivaroxaban. CRP decreased to 8.2 mg/dL on 6/23/21.

We were in the booth for a few minutes where I was trying to get her to relax and breathe.  Her father was there the entire time. I gave the Pfizer vaccine and she stated &#34;that was it?&#34;  She seemed ok upon leaving the booth.  Her and her Father sat in the observation area directly in front of the pharmacy. About 5 minutes passed when her Father tapped on the window.  Went out to check on the patient and she was pale and little disoriented.  She ended up throwing up as well. We gave her a bag so she wouldn&#39;t have to stand up and could stay near her father, to prevent a fall. ?We gave her a cold compress and a water and had her stay for 30 minutes.  By the time she left, she had her color back and was able to say that she was feeling much better.  Her father was not surprised that she had a reaction like this and stated that she usually has form of reaction like to vaccines.  She was ok by the time she left and they both stated they&#39;d be back for the second vaccine.

                                                Within 2 hours of the vaccine, patient was experiencing nausea and general feeling of unwellness. Within 3 hours, patient had a fever of 99.9. At 11 pm, patient had a fever of 100. Mother administered Tylenol and patient went to bed. Patient woke up around 4:30 am with her whole body shaking uncontrollably. Mother heard her stirring and went to check on her. Her temperature was 100. Mother sat and talked with her and offered a snack, drink, and more Tylenol. Mother checked her pulse, which was normal. Patient was coherent and able to communicate. Mother left the room to get snack and drink and heard something fall over in patient&#39;s room and Mother called out and waited a few seconds for a response. Patient did not respond. Mother went back in the room, as it was unusual for patient not to respond, and found patient sitting back up and placing her head in her hands, stating in a panicked voice that she felt she was going to throw up and that she was very hot and that her head hurt really bad. Patient stated that her ears felt weird and everything went black and she somehow fell over from a sitting position on her bed to laying on her bed and had landed on the dog. Patient was unaware that she had knocked over her water bottle and had no recollection of the loud sound it made as it fell over (unusual because loud sounds are very startling for her). The shaking subsided to a tremor a few minutes after the black out. Patient then reported feeling very cold and her temperature had risen to 101. Patient complained of an extreme headache and continued nausea. Mother took patient to Urgent Care, who performed bloodwork and an EKG, and then referred patient to the Emergency Room for an EEG.  ER repeated EKG and declined to do EEG and told patient to follow up with her doctor in 5 - 7 days.

                                                Pt was brought in by her father for her first dose of Pfizer vaccine. Prior to receiving the vaccine, her father asked her to let the writer know of her fear of needle and what occurs when she she has blood draws or vaccination. Patient states that she usually lays down because she feels faint and passes out at times. After she sat down, another chair was provided to rest her legs. Pfizer dose was administered and within a minute, she acknowledged that she about to passed out. She had a near syncopal episode with both arms contracting. She was carried from the chair to the floor. Her father, who was prepared for this, had ammonia with him and had the patient sniff it and she responded to it. She was observed for little over 30 minutes and walked out of the pharmacy stating that she felt well. Throughout the ordeal, she was responding appropriately.

After she came to we helped her to a chair and sat her down, advised her to put her head between her knees, and got her some water that she requested.  After a few minutes she appeared rather pale and went to ask her if she was ok and she asked for a trash can because she felt like she was going to be sick.  We gave her a garbage bag and she did get sick in the garbage bag.  We kept an eye on her for another 15-20 minutes and she stated that she felt better and that she thought she was ok to leave.   We offered her help to her car but she denied it saying she would be ok with she walked slowly.  Her father was with her the entire time.  While talking with them the father did state that she had incidents like that in the past where she stood up too fast and got light headed and passed out.

                                                Pt started exhibiting a dry cough that progressed in frequency over the course of aprox. 15 mins.  Patients father remained at her side, patients father administered two puffs of patients inhaler, Albuterol, for the coughing.   Nurses attended at patients side, checked vitals which were stable with oxygen saturation of 100% and however, pulse noted to be elevated in the 130&#39;s.  RN auscultated lung sounds, no wheezing noted, but pt exhibiting signs of anxiousness as well now.  Pt assisted to wheelchair and to area to lie down for further evaluation.

I don?t believe she hit her head we didn?t see a lump. She came too right away and got nauseated and light-headed again sitting up so we took her to lay down on the stretcher. She was doing ok but laying down when I left.   The nurse that administered the immunization wrote: She got vaccinated, tolerated it well. Told her sister she barely felt it and expressed relief. Sat for a minute while in handed her mom paperwork ( vaccination card). Then got up, stood with mom and brother. Was standing one minute and went down without warning, standing next to brother and mom. I had just finished vaccinating the sister, I was putting a bandaid on her when it happened so couldn&#39;t have been more than a couple of minutes.   Dr.  observed this patient after they passed out at the vaccination clinic and subsequently released her home with the family.

Medical work up has been thorough and has resulted negatively, including blood work, UDS, CT Head. She has remained slightly tachycardic, though she has also been moving continuously for several hours. Her physical exam is notable for several indicators of psychogenic origin, including demonstrating variability in tremor frequency (head, legs and arms vacillating it variable rates over time), distractability from motor tasks (head or arms stop shaking when asked to focus on moving her legs, for example). Her speech has also been affected, but this is also variable and she is at times using only 1 word sentences and other times responding more completely. Certainly she may have suffered a psychological stress today as she is fearful of needles and has a history of vasovagal response and her mother notes recent overwhelm with school performance, though this is not unusual for her. If medical work up continues to be negative, it may be reasonable to conclude she is suffering a conversion disorder  &#34;FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Conversion reaction after a Covid 19 vaccine.

Approximately 3 minutes after shot was given I was called out to the waiting room as the patient had passed out. I helped her mother lower her to the floor and by the time we lowered her down she was regaining consciousness. After about 5 minutes she was feeling better and we moved her into the immunization room to wait for EMS. EMS came and evaluated her and determined she was ok to go home

The patient passed out for a few minutes and responded after we both called her several times.  We called 911. She was feeling nauseous.  She sipped a little water and was looking very pale and was starting to become unconscious again.  Mother thought it was an allergic reaction and asked for Epipen.  Epinephrine was administered, and patient became alert and less pale.  EMS came and took her away due to low blood pressure

When she told her mother that&#39;s when mom noted the facial droop and took her to ER for evaluation. There she was given steroids and a prescription for eye drops and oral steroids. She has not taken the oral steroids at this time but nearly all of her symptoms have resolved.

                                                Prior to arrival, the patient received her first COVID vaccine at the clinic, after which she suddenly felt dizzy, described as lightheadedness, and felt warm. She was noted to be hypotensive with SBP at 67. She subsequently drank water with some improvement. No syncope, severe headache, numbness, tingling sensations, or focal weakness. Mother was concerned and brought the child to the ED for further evaluation. Currently the patient feels better. No similar symptoms in the past. The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. No recent fever or cough.She is otherwise healthy and has a normal cardiopulmonary exam and reassuring EKG.  The description of her symptoms and the environment which happened is very consistent with vasovagal syncope and she does not have any stigmata, and acute neurologic or cardiac emergency.  I believe she is safe and stable for discharge home and she was discharged with return precautions and follow-up instructions.

We checked her in and (pharmacist ) gave her shot with her mom present at 2 10pm and she was fine with no issues. Within 2 minutes in of her observation period, she started fainting and having seizure like for about 10 seconds, and regained conscious and said she felt dizzy and then blacked out. She was pale and sweating and asked for water. Our shift lead happened to be closed by her chair where she was sitting so she prevented pt from falling down from the chair and called pharmacist for help from inside the pharmacy. Pharmacist rushed to the patient and asked shift lead to call 911. Pt was consious, but lethargic, she could breath normally, no sign of obtruction airway. Pharmacist lift her legs up to opposite chair and started to take BP. Paramedic arrived within minutes and took her vitals which was normal. Mom agreed for paramedic took her out in stretcher to hospital for check up.

Mom was with her--patient was coherent and speaking to me.  She said her head hurt--I told her I&#39;d get an ice pack, which I did and gave to her.  Mom was really worried so I asked her if she wanted me to call 911, which I did.  2 EMTs came and checked the patient out.  Mom wanted her to go get checked out at the hospital so the patient and Mom went with the EMTs.  I called Mom around 8:00pm 5/28/2021 and she said pt was checked out.  The hospital doctor said it was a vaso-vagal reaction and released patient home with no restrictions.

On her way from immunization room to the resting area, she fainted. Since her mom was holding her, she didn&#39;t fall. She was put down on the floor and regain consciousness within a minute. 911 was called. While waiting for paramedics, Rph took her blood pressure with result of 110/71 HR 89. Patient then walked back to immunization room with mom and Rph&#39;s help. When paramedics arrived, they took her blood and it was low. They provided IV fluid and she was taken to hospital by ambulance.

                                                First off, I do not know if this is related but I wanted to report in case other people found the same. We would not know of the issue if my daughter didn&#39;t have a medical procedure 4 days after her shot when she got heart rate checked. Pre-op on May 19 she went to pediatrician and have HR of 75. 3 days later got first Pfizer shot on 5/22. 4 days later on 5/26 she went to hospital in morning for a pre-planned laser treatment necessitating general anesthesia. Pre-anesthesia she had a resting heartrate of 38. Post - treatment it took a long time for her HR to stabilize and get close to 40 again.   Our pediatrician wants us to see a cardiologist but we couldn&#39;t get an appointment until June 22. She said hold off on 2nd vaccine until we meet cardiologists. She wants weekly vitals checks, yesterdays the HR was up to 55.  No clue if it&#39;s related but the night of the treatment when there was concern of her low HR I read about teens having heart issues after vaccine, so it made me wonder. The only thing that happened between 5/19 and 5/26 was her Pfizer shot and her HR went from 75 to 38 in that week.  Waiting for cardiologist but wanted to pass this along just in case. No other symptoms so we wouldn&#39;t have known if we hadn&#39;t checked her heart 4 days later!

She was nauseous, unable to sit and even stand. She was getting rainbow circles in her vision. Rushed her to emergency to UCSF, drs ran various  blood tests and brain MRI but everything was normal. It was also found that Bipasha had high BP 149/61. The drs could not make out what happened and they discharged her later on after giving some IV fluids and some pain medicine.  On 5/31 and 6/1, at home, patient was seemingly okay.  On 6/2, Wednesday, patient developed headache again, same symptoms like on 5/30. We rushed her to Urgent care in Fremont and saw her pediatrician dr and a pediatric neurologist. Her BP was high then also 144/87. No cause could be found why. The pediatric neurologist was suggesting it is possible that some Inflammation could be causing the blood fluctuations. Orthostatic testing resulted in major fluctuations of BP.  Both neurologist and neurosurgeon have ruled out hydrocephalus. They are saying heart inflammation could be a cause.

                                                Immediately after the patient received the vaccine, the patient turned pale and said, &#34;I feel a little dizzy and my vision is blurry.&#34;  The patient fainted and ended up having a seizure.  Once the patient regained consciousness, the patient was nauseated and vomited.  Minutes later she had another seizure but immediately came out of it.  We asked the patient if this happen to her during the first dose and she said it did not.  The patient does not have a history of epilepsy.  The patient&#39;s mother did say she had the exact same reaction when she had braces put on.  The patient sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes while drinking water.  Before the patient left, we had check up on her and she said she felt completely fine.  I (the pharmacist) called the mother a couple of hours later to check up on the patient.  The mother said she felt fine as if nothing ever happened.  I did recommend to her that her daughter  gets checked up at urgent care today just to be on the safe side.  The mother said she has an appointment with her primary care next week.

                                                She got the second shot of COVID-19 shot around 3 PM on 6/3. She had a sore arm, lower fever, and headache on the second day (6/4), which was expected. On 6/5, she complained about chest congestion in the morning. She described that it felt like running after a mile. I asked her to drink more water and get some rest. The discomfort didn&#39;t get away, so I consulted her pediatrician over the phone. Her pulse and blood pressure were normal (86/103/75). She didn&#39;t feel short of breath. And her finger oximeter result was 99.  In the afternoon, she described the discomfort as after some strenuous exercise and kept putting her hand over her heart. She felt tired and didn&#39;t have a good appetite for lunch or dinner, and only ate half meals. After dinner, around 9:30, she throws up and felt a little better.  Then she took a capsule of Motrin liquid gel of 200 mg ibuprofen and went to bed. She slept well and felt OK this morning.

The morning after while taking their temperature, Maddison said she couldn&#39;t see anything then fell into my arms. Her pupils quickly dilated, she made gutteral sounds while shaking slightly then lost consciousness. I couldn&#39;t see her breathing for about 15 seconds and she was confused when she came to. She couldn&#39;t hear, see or speak during the episode. We took her to the emergency room where a chest xray and ekg came back clear.

                                                Patient got her 2nd Pfizer Covid-19 shot at 5:45 PM on Tues 6/8. She had some of the typical side effects the next day- a sore arm, flu-like body aches, a headache and fatigue. In the middle of the night Wed night/Thurs morning at 3AM she woke up with chest pain and difficulty breathing. In her words, her &#34;heart really hurts and it is hurts to breath.&#34; I gave her 1 (500 mg ) capsule of Tylenol. This was the first pain reliever she had received post shot. She also applied Frankincense oil over her heart. Patient was unable to go back to sleep for a few hours because it hurt too much. She did finally fall back asleep in the early morning hours. Yesterday (Thursday 6/10) she reported that she was feeling a lot better. Her heart was still a little painful but by today, Friday 6/11, she says she feels fine.  When I heard on the news about a number of other children between 12-15 who reported heart pain, I thought we should let you all know. I am a little worried that there might be some kind of long term complication for her heart.

A 15-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0167, Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19May2021 at 16:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 15-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergy and allergy to cats (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient had no covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medication included clonidine extended release (ER) at a dose of 0.1 mg daily taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient was not covid tested post vaccination. 0n 19May2021 at 19:45 hours (about 3 hours after receiving her shot), patient complained of itching all over, even in her ears, patient also mentioned her chest hurting and feeling short of breath. Patient was not sure whether her skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs, possibly because that was the area uncovered so she could see it. The blotchiness and chest pain resolved quickly, but the itchiness continued. Patient also complained of stomach pain, which occurred after patient&#39;s grandmother gave her a loratadine. The loratadine settled the itching down, but patient reported nausea the next morning and shortness of breath, as well. Patient received Claritin 24 Hr for the events as treatment. The outcome of the skin was red from scratching it, but thought it had been somewhat blotchy, too, on her legs and chest hurting was recovered on May-2021 and recovered for rest of the events in 2021  Follow up needed, further information has been requested.

She complained of the symptoms on Thursday morning and then we saw on the news that night that this was a newly discovered side effect for younger patients receiving the vaccine. She has not met with the doctor yet because she didn&#39;t want to miss final tests at school and the offices were closed for the weekend.  However, we have been monitoring her closely and had hoped it would disappear by now, but we will be seeking treatment tomorrow since it has not gotten worse, but it also hasn&#39;t improved after 4 days of rest.

                                                About an hour after receiving the 2nd vaccine, she developed a pain in the upper-mid sternal area.  She&#39;s not had any pain like this in the past.  The pain remained constant ever since it started, and there don&#39;t appear to be any alleviating factors such as position changes.  Deep inspiration makes it worse.  The pain radiates at times across the upper chest and down the back.  She&#39;s had some accompanying nausea.  She&#39;s also noticed feeling a little short of breath as the day progressed, which is not necessarily related to the pain.  She denies any palpitations or dizziness.  No near syncope or syncope.  The pain remained  a maximum intensity of 10/10. She therefore presented to the ER. Diagnostic studies including labs, EKG and a CT pulmonary angiogram were performed.  Troponin returned as elevated, but without EKG changes. She was transferred at the time to the Medical Center for admission. Echocardiogram was completed and normal. Vital signs remained normal. Troponin trended down. Pain improved and she was discharged home.

                                                My daughter received her second Pfizer vaccinations at 2:15 pm.  At 1230 at night she work up with stabbing chest pain in the center of her chest that lasted three hours.  She initially said her felt faint and couldn?t catch her breath as well as initial nausea.  Being an advanced healthcare professional, I spent five minutes of asking her questions:  did she eat something bad, did she feel like she needed and inhaler, did she need to use the restroom, checked her pulse (100bpm with palpitations), no resolve.  We live 5 minutes from hospital where we prefer to go, but my daughter didn?t think she could make the five minute ride there.  We went to ER that is around the block from us  and it was total chaos.  40 &#43; people in the waiting room to be seen. My daughter was visibly in distress, crying and couldn?t keep still because of the intense chest pain she rated a 10 out of 10.  Finally they did a 12 lead EKG.  The rolled us to the back of the waiting room.  After 15 minutes, I rolled back out to the front desk and no attention to her and her severe chest pain.  Finally I announced we were going to hospital.  The called back to us? ?Good Luck!? Got pt to hospital and the  immediately did EKG, lab work, chest x ray, urinalysis. The  chest pain became intermittent then final subsided.  The doctors ruled out pneumonia, No PE, EKG WNL, lab work fine.  The Doctor stated it was chest wall pain and gave us a NSAID prescription. I talked to my sister who is an nurse works in the vaccination clinics.  She said she has  had patients who have had bouts of pericarditis and pleurisy after the second shot.  That motivated me to google second dose Pfizer reaction in teens.  There is a rare side effect of myocarditis in the teen population after the second dose.  The publication date was June 4  the day before my daughters reaction.  I didn?t thinsk the ER physician was aware of the the possible rare side effect of myocarditis in teens.  I was happy with the care we did receive.

                                                Pt reports she had her first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 5/17/21. The following week she had a very heavy period that lasted longer than usual with severe cramps and occasional lightheaded/dizzy spells. After her cycle ended, she continued having  brief episodes of dizziness, usually when going from sitting to standing, usually resolved quickly (after a few minutes) with rest. Over the past two weeks, the episodes have become more frequent and intense, and over the past few days episodes also include s/s of seeing spots and having blurred vision with nausea, SOB, and palpitations/tachycardia. Tonight while at lacrosse practice, pt suddenly became dizzy and felt like she might pass out, became diaphoretic and pale.

The reporter took her to the emergency room, they did all the test and they didn&#39;t really see anything in the results. From there she cannot stop to have nausea and dizziness and clogged throat so the reporter had to give allergy medication to her every day. She did have, she never had an allergic reaction to any vaccine but the HPV vaccine (captured as unspecified vaccine in tab) what was similar to what she is experiencing now. She had nausea and the dizziness for a month that she couldn&#39;t stay in school and she has this nausea and dizziness and clogged throat she has to run for this allergy medication what normally she never needed. So, she doesn&#39;t want to take this second dose and the reporter was wondering if it is Pfizer because she was just like (Height), a (Weight) pounds if because the reporter understand the vaccine is one for everybody, isn&#39;t this strong for a kid with that height that weight, that you do not needed the second dose. The patient could not she said she will not because she goes to school and she feel the nausea and dizziness and so. The reporter would like to report it because it maybe Pfizer&#39;s that she was thinking that 1 dose would be enough for kids. When asked about the start of experiencing adverse events, the reported stated that &#34;Well the nausea and dizziness, she was a little bit not sure about like headache right after like her we stayed there like half hours because the doctor said to stay there because she has her reaction to which but then we just the reporter felt the nausea and everything was so bright you know, the reporter had the same effect but her went away and the patient after we received she was, the whole day but not too bad, 5 days after then she but she was already with this nausea, dizziness and 5 days after she got the palpitation, bad headache, nausea, dizziness and then I took her to the emergency room.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No they have improved, the only thing now left is every day she has this nausea, dizziness and then she said about dizziness and then nausea and then clogged throat and then the reporter gave her the &#39;allergic pill I gave that, to this allergy&#39; (not clarified further) really she gave only 1 tablet a day.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;On 20May2021, they did a blood test, they did urine test, they did a ECG, so the hospital did all and the doctor too, nothing new.&#34; The reporter had lab test result on chart, she stated they put on her chart but she also had the copy of the results. Okay, here they put the result is a line on the chart. Okay here they put like linear line lab test complete, she get all the line because here they didn&#39;t put results but screen for metabolic and kidney disorder they did, they did an &#39;urinary tract infection&#39; (not clarified) they have marked in the ECG. Okay you going to ask for specific (incomplete sentence).&#34; The patient had no other illness but reporter need to know what Gardasil and Covid 19 vaccine have in common because the symptoms were very similar. Nausea that does not go away. She asked if it is the preservative or what ingredients. Never had a reaction to any other vaccine.

Charge nurse hooked up patient to the pulse oximetry and called 911 at approx. 10:34 am. The patient?s O2 level was 83 with a pulse of 107. The charge nurse observed that the patient was under a lot of stress and was hyperventilating and unable to verbalize how she was feeling. Shortly after, the patient fainted due to hyperventilation. Observation nurse advised the patient to calm down and take deep breaths but the patient did not comply and continued rapid breathing. The patient started to vomit and made some gurgling sounds in her mouth and the charge nurse with the help of site specialist laid the patient on her left side. Shortly after, the patient stopped breathing.   Observation nurse administered the epi-pen on the patient?s right thigh. Immediately after administering the epi-pen, patient started to breathe again with an O2 level of 98 with a pulse of 110; but the patient was still unconscious and unresponsive. At approx. 10:36 am first responder paramedics arrived at the scene and took the patient to hospital for further evaluation.

A pharmacy technician was leaving the store simultaneously and upon witnessing the event ran back to the pharmacy to tell me I was needed to assist.  When I arrived, the patient was alert and breathing and able to answer questions regarding personal information, date, time and location.  Patient stated she felt normal other than some tingling sensation in her hands.  Patient reported that she hadn&#39;t eaten anything since waking up that morning.  EMS was already en route, and I observed the patient until they arrived.  Patient has since been transported to the hospital and is currently reported in stable condition.

By 1:45 she showed signs of being queasy and eventually passed out. Her father caught her, so no physical injuries were reported or seen. Blood pressure was taken roughly 3 minutes after collapse. In prone position on her back since loss of consciousness, her BP was 93/69 and pulse rate was 82.  Although ashen at first contact, her coloring was improving as EMS showed up 15 minutes after my arrival. Total incidence time was roughly 20 min.

This case pertains to patient 3 of 3. A 15-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8727; Expiry Date: 31Jul2021), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jun2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) as a single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. On 17Jun2021, after 15 minutes of observation, the patient had a severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness and stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. On an unspecified date, the patient also had nausea and vomiting. The patient pulse ox (documented as provided by caller) went down to 83%, she had severe headache, nausea, vomiting and she was unconscious. When she was unconscious was when her pulse ox was 83% and she stopped breathing intermittently for 10 to 12 seconds at a time. Then she started breathing again but was not responsive after she received the epinephrine then her pulse ox steadily rose again but was not responsive. She was like this until EMS took her away. The reporter stated that the most severe case was for this particular patient. She had already been vaccinated and had already gone through the 15 minute observation. All these kids came in a bus together, but this patient was sitting in the vehicle after the observation when the guardian brought her back to the nurses saying that she was complaining of a severe headache and at that point she had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness. The nurses reported that it appeared that she stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. At that time they administered epi (epinephrine) and called EMS. Her pulse ox and her breathing improved after the administration of epi, however she remained unresponsive when she was on the way to the hospital with EMS. The patient was taken to the hospital and she did improve. This was the 2nd dose, she had the 1st dose and did not have a reaction to it. The seriousness of the events severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as medically significant. The reporter stated that it was very serious. This patient reaction was a little more intense than just an anxiety induced reaction. She says with a pulse ox of 83% if they had not intervened then this would of been life threatening. It is medically significant but if they had not intervened then it would have been life threatening especially when you&#39;re talking about gurgling and a pulse ox of 83%. The reporter tends to think that with that severe of a reaction, with the pulse ox that low and her being unresponsive, she believes that this was probably a true adverse event. Outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  The reported causality for the events severe headache, had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as related.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, dyspnea and headache and the suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I had pt look at her mom during admin.  Patient did fabulous and told she did amazing as not even a speck of blood.  About 5 mins later i asked pt hiow she was, which was good.  About 15 mins later, she seemed lethargic and said she was dizzy.  I asked questions, took Temp and got ice packs.  I then called EMS as patient was not responding appropriastely.  BP, O2, HR were perfect
