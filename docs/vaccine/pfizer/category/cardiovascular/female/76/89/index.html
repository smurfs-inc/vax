                                                believed the heart rate might be a result of being nervous; Tightness of throat/throat tightness; Laboured breathing; Fast HR/high heart rate; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse, reporting for herself. A female patient of an unspecified age received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sensitivity to pollen, sensitivity to narcotics and allergic reactions to perfume, all from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received pneumonia vaccine and flu vaccine, both for immunization and experienced pain on the side. The patient also previously took cortisone to lower her immune system. It was reported that on 03Jan2021, the patient developed a slight reaction immediately after first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine which included tightness of throat along with laboured breathing with fast HR/heart rate was high (she believed it was greater than 80 BPM; her heart rate is usually in the 60&#39;s) which resolved after a few minutes. The nurse was going to give her Benadryl but did not as her signs and symptoms were resolving. She was asking for recommendations/clarifications on whether she should get the second dose given her reactions. She never had that type of reaction before. She had had sensitivity to pollen and narcotics. She read that she should not receive the second dose given her reactions but was asking for clarification. She would like to get the second dose and bought an Epi pen. Throat tightness and high heart rate didn&#39;t last for more than two minutes maximum. She visited websites and was directed not to get the second dose. She wanted to be 100% certain in regards to whether or not she should receive the second dose. Stated tightness in throat wasn&#39;t really that bad. She felt throat tightness previously when smelling perfume. Stated it wasn&#39;t anything to be frightened about. She also stated some websites said it does not matter and some websites said not to get the second dose. Also wanted to know if having the Epi Pen would help. She added that she explained reaction to the physician who advised her to get an Epi Pen for the second COVID Vaccine dose. She only had allergic reactions to pollen and perfume. Got the vaccine for Pneumonia and Flu. Did not get adverse reactions, but stated she only had pain on the side. Confirmed she has no NDC/Lot/Exp for the Pneumonia vaccine and Flu vaccine. She also got Coronavirus three months prior to receiving the COVID vaccine. She clarified that she diagnosed herself and it was the weirdest thing. She took cortisone to lower her immune system. Received first dose of COVID Vaccine on 03Jan2021. She wa due for second COVID Vaccine on 26Jan2021. She stated she is a psychologist with specialty in mental health. She believed the heart rate might be a result of being nervous. When she is nervous her heart rate goes up. Tightness of throat made her concerned. When asked about the indication, she stated that her husband works and the right thing to do was to be protected. She read she should have stopped taking Ibuprofen 10 days prior to the COVID Vaccine. She was not taking Ibuprofen any longer. Has no NDC/Lot/Exp for Ibuprofen at time of call. Confirmed she did not use the Epi Pen after the first dose of COVID Vaccine. She bought it for the second dose. The nurse who administered COVID Vaccine to the patient suggested she take Benadryl. By that time, she was feeling better. She stated it was questionable for half an hour. The outcome of the event Tightness of throat/throat tightness and fast HR/high heart rate was recovered on 03Jan2021 while the outcome of all other events was unknown.

                                                Patient was observed for 15 minutes after the vaccination administration, felt fine, and left the facility with her husband.  The 2 of them drove 2 blocks away to a restaurant to eat.  Midway through her meal, she reported that she started to feel &#34;funny&#34; like she was &#34;drunk&#34; or something, and felt nausea and hot/sweaty.  Her husband got her in the vehicle and drove to the vaccination facility,  When he arrived, she was obtunded and &#34;out of it.&#34;  No respiratory distress, No noted rash, but some clamminess/diaphoresis.  She was initially examined by FNP and cursory limited neuro exam while patient was seated did not reveal any gross motor deficits.  FNP called 911 and staff called for me.  When I arrived, patient was groggy, but responsive.  She was A&amp;O x3 and in no distress. Pulse 54, strong and regular (normal rate for her per patient--on a Beta blocker).  BP 120/74.  O2 sat 97% on outdoor cold air.  Patient was able to move all extremities equally and with equal strength.  Lungs CTA, Heart regular no murmur, abdomen soft.  Patient complained of continued malaise/grogginess and nausea, no vomiting.  EMS arrived, checked glucose, which was &#34;normal&#34; (I didn&#39;t hear the result) and patient declined transport.  I discussed ER evaluation vs. continued monitoring by me.  Patient and husband requested monitoring.  Patient stayed in the vehicle with her husband, I gave the husband my phone number to call if any worsening.  I checked on her 5 minutes later, then 10 minutes after that.  By that time, her adult daughter had arrived.  We again discussed continue family monitoring  vs. ER.  The family wanted to take the patient home to monitor.  Patient stated &#34;If I could just go to bed, I think I will be fine.&#34;  I called to check on the patient at 6p.  She had rested well and was improved.  She still felt a bit groggy, but otherwise was feeling better.  I called to check on the patient 1/29 at noon.  At that point, husband stated that she was &#34;back to normal. Symptoms and signs appeared to be consistent with a vasovagal response.  I suspected symptoms may have been prolonged by her Beta blocker

EMS was called and patient was found to be in Vfib. ACLS was performed for approximately 42 minutes prior to arrival at ED. At that time the patient had been pulseless for 25 minutes. Patient received 450 mg of amiodarone, epinephrine x7, sodium bicarbonate x2, and 7 AED shocks. In the ED 3 more doses of epinephrine were given, one more dose of sodium bicarbonate, and 5 additional shocks. ROSC was not achieved and time of death was called at 1416.

                                                Immediately, within 2 hours of the vaccination, I developed a severe headache, join pain (knees, elbows, mostly legs and lower extremities) which evolved into intense, burning abdominal pain.  My blood pressure rose to 160; however, there was no fever, cough or shortness of breath.  This condition lasted until the 7am on the morning of February 8th, but pains returned that evening (Monday 2/8) through Tuesday morning.  Symptoms subsided during the day on Tuesday, yet on Tuesday evening (2/9, approximately 48 hours after the injection), severe symptoms returned, similar to the initial evening.  I visited my Primary Physician on Wednesday afternoon (2/10) for a consult.

A 76-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number EL3247), intramuscular on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included COVID symptoms from 16Jan2021 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient with acute resp failure, COVID pneumonia, that developed symptoms 9 days prior to admit and ultimately received first vaccine 6 days prior to a admit, then shortly after progressed with other covid symptoms and was admitted on 25Jan2021. She decompensated while intp and was transferred to ICU for rising O2 needs, ultimately had to be intubated. Became hypotensive due to massive hamatoma 2&#39; bleeding into abd rectus muscle. Sx and IR consulted and did beside exploration of hematoma. Initially blood pressure responded but overnight continued with refractory hypotension. Maxed out vasopressin and levophed, hemodynamics deteriorated. The patient died on 02Feb2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events death, COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, abdominal wall haematoma and abdominal wall haemorrhage cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

The 2nd night, Tuesday, 2/16/21 it got bad, woke up around the same time early morning,  had pain on the right quadrant of her upper body, from her ear, eye, throat and down to right under her throat.  When she swallows the pain is very severe with difficulty swallowing and that pain radiates to the upper part of her chest.   Then on the third night, last night, all the same pain but the headache had disappeared.   Today, 2/18/21 she is still having the same symptoms.  The hardest thing to deal with is the ear pain in the right ear, and the pain under her right throat area.  She has taken one Benadryl at 8:00 AM, and will take another at 8:00 PM.  The Benadryl triggers her tinnitus so is limited with that.  Her daughter is trying to find OTC medicine for the ear.  She has not called her doctor as they are trying to treat it with OTC medicines.    For additional information call her daughter: who takes care of all her medical information.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, my daughter took me to my Cardiologist appointment (this was scheduled before I received the vaccine). When I got to my doctor my blood pressure was elevated, it was about 180/88. My blood pressure is never that high. It did go down before I left to 140/84. When we were walking in the elevator after leaving the appointment my gait was unsteady. I felt very weak. I also light headed, and dizzy.  It felt like the feeling of the sedation you have receive  before having surgery. When we made it home I couldn&#39;t even see straight.  This lasted about 2 hours. I feel much better today.

I went to bed around 11:30 and didn&#39;t sleep very well.  On Wed. am after going to the bathroom, I felt woozy while washing my hands.  When I thought I felt better, I made my way back to the bedroom and passed out.  I fell on my right side, bruising the right side of my face, my right hip and my right thigh.  I apparently had my left hand under me when I fell because I broke the knuckle under the pinkie of my left hand.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, diabetic, stage 3 kidney disease, known allergies to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that patient got the shot on Thursday morning (04Feb2021) and later that evening reported as at 10:00pm, the patient developed a nose bleed that would not stop. By 10:30pm  she passed out/fell, site car management was called and she was sent to the ER where she stayed for evaluations for 2 days. The reporter does not think the Covid shot was connected to the event. No treatment was given to the patient. The patient had no covid prior to  vaccination and was not tested for covid post vaccination. The patient was recovering from the events at the time of the report.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included as heart medication (unspecified). The patient previously received FLU VACCINE on an unspecified date for immunization. The patient reported that she had the first Pfizer Covid-19 shot last Wednesday (27Jan2021) and got an adverse event, rapid heartbeat. She ended up going to the emergency room and had an EKG, chest x-ray, and bloodwork (complete blood work) to see for heart problems, they checked her heart. Normally her heart rate was about 50-60, but hers went up, the highest was 135. She was monitored, and her heart rate went to 110, 96, 105, and it kept going up and down and then she was later released. It didn&#39;t actually go back down to normal until about 8:30-8:45 that night as mentioned once the heart rate went down that night, it&#39;s been normal since then. The outcome of the event was recovered on 27Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. She was to get the second dose on 17Feb2021 and not sure if she should get it or not, wanted to know what Pfizer recommends.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

Got up about 2AM to go to the bathroom; started back to bed; had a bad taste in mouth, so decided to brush my teeth.  Started brushing and all of a sudden, felt faint; before I could get the toothbrush back, I fell and my husband rushed over. Said I was out completely; got me awake and back up and went to bed and slept. until 11am.   At 3pm when taking a shower, noticed my left shoulder blade was real sore and looked and there were 3 red strips below should blade - no bleeding tho.  top R. side of head kinda sore, so must have hit when falling. Went back to bed and slept good.  Didn&#39;t need to go to the Dr. and am feeling good now.  Just rested for a couple days.  Had been feeling really good and don&#39;t take any prescriptions, so could only think it had to have something to do with the shot. Today is the 4th day and feel good.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

The pt reports that she received the first COVID vaccine several weeks ago and immediately afterwards she felt warm and had some difficulty focusing and walking. This resolved and she has since felt well. Today at 0800 she had her second dose of the COVID vaccine. About 15 minutes later she had an acute change in her mental status. She became disoriented and slow to answer questions. She also started having difficulty walking. She was also noted to be hypertensive with systolic BP in the 200s. She was subsequently sent here by the doctor at the vaccine clinic via EMS. Currently the pt is feeling somewhat improved and more back to her baseline. She notes that she still does not feel quite herself. Notes that her symptoms feel similar to her reaction after the first vaccine except much worse. Sates she takes Levothyroxine but no other medications. She last had her thyroid numbers checked in January and they were somewhat &#34;off.&#34;

                                                is here today for ED follow-up on A-fib. Patient stated she is not taking Eliquis.    She had no side effects from her first COVID-19 vaccine. After the 2nd one she had muscle aches, headache, freezing cold, and &#34;weird&#34;, and felt really badly then at 9:30 PM, 32 hrs after the 2nd vaccine dose she felt the a-fib started. She had not been in a-fib in many years. Cardiology had already recommended eliquis but she was holding off. She had diltiazem from 2017 that she tried but with out relief. They rate controlled her but she remained in a-fib, started eliquis, and she went home. For 2.5 weeks she had headache and chest pain, other muscle pain, felt horrible, until she stopped the Eliquis.  Since stopping the Eliquis, she still has occasional mild chest pain, and headache, and flushing.   Her current chest pain is left chest, not radiating. The quality varies, stabbing pain in a very small location at times, may be associated with eating.   She did have a stress test years ago and was &#34;fine&#34;.   She had a dental appointment planned that she had to cancel, she has moved it to May 4th.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question. The reporter considered the events fatigue aggravated serious and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as medically significant. The outcome of the events fatigue aggravated recovering; as for the events blood pressure raised, &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39;, lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired were not recovered; while the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 01Apr2021 (reported as 2 days after). The outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events fatigue aggravated and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as serious (IME).Based on the plausible temporal association and product safety profile, the reported events are possibly related to the vaccine BNT162B2. administration. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

                                                Blood clot in her lower abdominal area; had the worst pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle; had the worst pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle; nerves are all tangled up; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Mar2021 13:50 (at 76-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. Medical history included hip replacement four years ago in 2017 (First right then 2 months later left) and knee replacement six years ago in 2015 (both 2 months apart). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6203), administered in Left Arm on 25Feb2021 (at 76-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced bad headaches. The patient received the second dose of vaccine on 17Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, she was not hurting and went to brunch with friends. Afterwards (on the same date, 29Mar2021), she was sitting and got the worst pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. She drove herself home but was in such misery. She went to the emergency room the next day, on 30Mar2021, wherein she had a CT (computerized tomography) scan that showed a blood clot in her lower abdominal area. She was taking pain medication every 6 hours, or she could hardly stand it. On 08Apr2021, she went back to the emergency room because she could hardly stand it. She was kept in observation status but was not admitted. She was scheduled to have another CT scan on 06May2021. She is not sure what they will do because the nerves are wrapped around it. She also mentioned that her doctor wants to do a biopsy. The pain was also running down to her ankle. She stated that she has had both of her hips replaced in the past. She added that her doctor will do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). He will put in a drain if it has not shrunk. The doctor can&#39;t do anything because the nerves are all tangled up (2021). As corrective treatment, the patient was taking pain medication for the blood clot and pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. Outcome of nerves are all tangled up was unknown, while outcome of the other events was not recovered.

They were also taking blood every 4 hours (unknown results). The provided diagnosis was arterial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and cannot rule out anterior infarct and abnormal EKG (Mar2021). The events cannot rule out anterior infarct and abnormal EKG, butterflies in the chest that went to quivering, A-Fib/Arterial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response resulted in emergency room visit and physician office visit and let to hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized from 2021 to an unknown date (also reported for 2 days, for clarification). It also gave her A-Fib, trouble breathing and now her heart rate is screwed up (Mar2021).

                                                Systolic pressure for five days up to 220 -  Added extra blood pressure medicine in the middle of the day.  That kept the systolic pressure slightly under 160.  Diastolic pressure was never over 75.  Symptoms were sweating, heart pounding, headache, and fatigue.. Resolved itself on May 16, 2021 at approximately 6 p.m. when blood pressure again registered 125/74.

She denied chest pain or shortness of breath but noticed intermittent bouts of palpitations.  She went to see her PCP who referred her to the emergency room.  EKG and telemetry  in the emergency room were significant for new onset rapid atrial fib.  She was given diltiazem and admitted to the hospitalist service.  CT of the chest was negative for pulmonary emboli or focal consolidation.  She had no electrolyte derangements she has no history of sleep apnea and no history of obesity.  Her troponin and delta were unremarkable.  She was subsequently admitted to the hospitalist service.  She was treated with metoprolol and amiodarone  along with Eliquis.  She was seen by her cardiologist.  Her recent echocardiogram was normal.  Her TSH was actually elevated at 11.0 so her levothyroxine dose was increased to 175 mcg daily with a TSH in 6 weeks.

Patient is being seen in the emergency department for evaluation of the above, here with her daughter.  Patient was seen and evaluated by local urgent care and referred here for evaluation.  Is reported that patient was hypoxic.  Patient&#39;s daughter also states that they have been monitoring her oxygen saturation at home and it has been in the 60s and 80%.  Patient does report a cough.  She has been using her inhaler more frequently.  Received her Covid vaccination 2 days ago.   Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted and placed on supplemental O2.  Chest x-ray 4/15/2021 showed some opacity at the left costophrenic angle effusion with some areas of atelectasis possible.  Chest CT performed on 4/16/2021 revealed small areas of consolidation/infiltrate in the right upper and left lower lobes of the lungs, emphysema, and a 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since CT of12/11/2020.  Initial CBC revealed white blood cell count of 9.3.  Hemoglobin and hematocrit were stable at 8.8 and 29.4.  Renal function was stable as well.  Glucose on 4/16/2021 fasting was 222.  Magnesium was at goal at 2.5.  Procalcitonin levels were performed and were 0.19.  She was initially started on IV vancomycin and cefepime as well as Flagyl due to possible aspiration pneumonia.   On 4/17/2021, patient was adamant on being discharged.  She did discuss possibly signing out AMA.  I did explain to her the ramifications of that.  She voiced understanding.  I also discussed this with her daughter, as well.  She required 4 L of supplemental O2 and achieved an O2 sat of 93%.  On room air patient was 78%.  Therefore, home O2 was ordered.  IV antibiotics were changed to oral Levaquin 250 mg to take 1 by mouth daily (based on renal function) for 7 days and generic Flagyl 500 mg to take 1 3 times a day for 7 days.  She was instructed to take antibiotics as prescribed as well as use supplemental O2.  She was also advised that if symptoms worsened she was to return to the emergency room.   At time of discharge she was stable with supplemental O2 in place.  ED to Hosp-Admission Discharged  4/28/2021 - 5/4/2021 (6 days)    Last attending ? Treatment team    Hospital Course     HPI:  a 76 y.o. female with a past medical history of systolic and diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, above-the-knee amputation of left lower extremity, who comes from home where her oxygen saturation as per the daughter was 25%.  She was recently discharged from here on 4/17/2021 for left lower lobe pneumonia.  She does not want to be in the hospital.  She states that she felt fine when she came in this time.  She was evaluated by the ICU who stated she is a DNR/DNI and felt that with BiPAP modification she was satting better.  She was adamant that she wanted to leave the last time she was here and went home with oral Levaquin and Flagyl.  When she arrived, nursing states that there was dried stool on her bottom.  The patient denies any current shortness of breath.  She wants her BiPAP mask removed as it is uncomfortable to her.  After explaining it as needed she agreed to have it on.  She denies any abdominal pain, she denies any chest pain.  She denies any fevers or chills.   Hospital Course:   Patient was admitted for acute on chronic diastolic CHF, acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to CHF and COVID-19.  Patient was also treated for elevated blood pressures.  Cardiology was consulted, patient was placed on Lasix twice daily and was started on hydralazine for blood pressure.  From pneumonia standpoint, patient started on Zosyn, for COVID-19 patient was started on Decadron and remdesivir.  Patient finished a course of remdesivir in the hospital.  Patient went from using 5 L oxygen to only 1 L, meanwhile chronically she has been using 3 L at home prior to coming into the hospital.  Patient has not been requiring any further BiPAP.  She has been afebrile for more than 48 hours.  Today nephrology recommended to lower Lasix down to once daily instead of twice daily to avoid kidney injury.  Patient is medically stable for discharging home today to finish her course of Augmentin and Decadron.  Patient appears to be very hesitant about having to continue self isolating.  Family understands the need for further isolation.  Patient will receive a remote monitoring kit upon discharge. ED to Hosp-Admission Discharged  5/10/2021 - 5/17/2021 (7 days)    Last attending ?

A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot: EM9810; NDC number: Not Provided Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 06Feb2021 at 8:31AM (at the age of 76 years), as a 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included disc protruding (diagnosed before the covid vaccine in Jun2020 or around that, she recalls having several months of MRI&#39;s in 2020) and high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included Epidural Shot (Verbatim) for Protruding Disc Patient on 27Jan2021 (she had to go to the doctor in the clinic and get epidural shot in the back at the disc thats protruding). Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot: EL3249; NDC number: Not Provided, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 at 12 PM (noon) as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 76 years) for COVID-19 immunization. Clinical course: She took second dose of Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 06Feb2021, though she had no reaction initially. A week later from vaccination on Feb2021, she then began to notice her eyes started getting swollen couple days after, she then felt like her eyes felt like they were closing, then she saw her whole face was swelling, it looks like she had Chipmunk cheeks. She went to the doctor hoping it would go away, she was prescribed Benadryl and a decongestant as treatment. She takes Benadryl three times a day and the decongestant in the morning and her face is still swollen. It started with the eyes and the bag under the eyes, that was the first thing she noticed. She laughs and though she initially had an eye infection. She just wants to know if there is any other reports of this happening, or how to get rid of it, this has been there since she got her second dose on the 06Feb2021 since like 10Feb2021. After the second vaccine on 06Feb2021 around that time an hour later, she was on the way home and started getting hungry, she thought that was a symptom as well as her arm hurt a bit. She was starving till Monday got up 2AM, 6AM ate all day Sunday and Monday ate all day, as reported &#34;all she knows is she was craving a crab sandwich.&#34; Her Eyes swelling started a couple days later and the Face swelling was either the second week or same time, she just recalls looking at the eyes. She recalls telling her son her face felt tight in Feb2021. At the doctors appointment she was 127lbs, probably because of the swelling, but she is usually 119lbs or 118lbs, she is a small girl. The Appointment with the doctor was yesterday (15Mar2021), they prescribed Benadryl. Patient clarified that she was not Prescribed Zyrtec, it was a decongestant but she does not know the name of it. The Druggist however told her she could take another medication also. As reported &#34;The eye swelling and face swelling, at the moment she look like she been drunk, her face is plentiful, she is still swollen, her lids are not bad, but it is ongoing, it has gotten worse because prior she didnt even know it was there and its showing more now. She asked son if he thought she was swollen because she feels tight, over the weekend her face being swollen was noticeable, she is noticing people are pointing it out now.&#34; She adds her arm did not hurt with first dose. Second dose administered on the Left Arm, her arm did hurt a little on 06Feb2021, the day she got this dose and the next day (07Feb2021). She thought initially that she didn&#39;t have any side effects. She had High blood pressure yesterday (15Mar2021), but that usually goes up and down for her and nothing new. It was reported that, a week later, patient experienced swelling under her eyes, face was swollen, eye infection and face felt tight on Feb2021; hunger and vaccination site pain on 06Feb2021 (reported as the day she got this dose); hypertension on 15Mar2021 (reported as yesterday). Patient would like to know if swelling of the face is a reported side effect from the covid vaccine, how long her side effects from the covid vaccine will last and asking for suggestions on how to get rid of the side effects from the covid vaccine. The outcome of event vaccination site pain was recovered in Feb2021 (duration of event was 2 days), swelling under her eyes, face was swollen was not recovered while outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                About a week after the vaccine, I started to notice a subtle difference in my heart beat.  At night, I could feel my heart beat was a little off. I went to the doctor for something unrelated and was place on EKG that&#39;s how the doctor detected my arrythmia.  He said I had A-fib and sent me to the ER.   The ER confirmed my A-fib with an EKG and prescribed Eliquis, furosemide and potassium.  A few days after discharge, I had chest heaviness and couldn&#39;t breath.  I went to the ER.  They did an EKG, CAT scan, blood work  which also confirmed A-fib and build up of fluid around my heart, lungs and abdomen.  I followed up with a cardiologist office and was to continue with the medications at discharge.    I am being followed with a cardiolgist.  Since then, my heart rythm is back to normal from what I can tell.

She also takes an allergy medication and something for cholesterol that she has been taking for years. She called on 21Jan2021 around 5pm regarding the Pfizer covid vaccine. She called because she was having blood pressure issues and two different doctors thought it was covid vaccine related. It has taken since then till today to get a reasonable blood pressure.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthmatic, had double pneumonia years ago, has ongoing atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker to control it as the only problem she has in her heart. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient was hospitalized for 2.5 days after having symptoms of a massive heart attack two days after the vaccine. It was reported that two days post vaccination, the patient was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as they thought she was having a massive heart attack. She added her symptoms lasted for hours, she had pain so bad that she was bent over and had a little trouble breathing. She said the pain was in the heart and underneath the rib, on the left side. She later mentioned she did not feel like it was AFib. She said they did every test possible and listed the following ones: ultrasound, stress test, x-ray (unknown results), and blood work in Feb2021. She specified that her blood work indicated a blood clot. She mentioned she was told by her personal friend, who was a doctor, that by having the shot sometimes it indicated you have blood clots when you really don&#39;t. The patient also specified that she broke out in a sweat, the pain was so severe that she  could not bend over and could not get up; therefore, they treated her as if she was having a massive heart attack for 12 hours at the hospital. It was reported that they kept giving her stuff to stop the effect with her heart.  She mentioned her second dose was scheduled on 25Feb2021. She asked if her experience was reported as a side effect to the vaccine and should she get the second dose of the vaccine. She explained the doctors did not know what she had, and she needed to determine if she can receive the second dose. She also asked if we could notify her if a similar reaction is reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EM9801), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 04Feb2021 (Administered between 9:30-10:00AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath. She said it was cold outside by her nephew&#39;s graveside, but she felt she had to fan herself like she was overheated. She said her heart rate was flying, and she had an irregular heart beat. She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell. She said she was tested the Friday before her nephew&#39;s funeral and was negative for the COVID-19 Virus. She said she has had a total of four COVID-19 Virus tests before, and all her COVID-19 Virus tests have been negative. She clarified she did not have a COVID-19 Virus test while she was at the ER on Saturday, 13Feb2021. With her nephew&#39;s death, getting her COVID-19 Vaccine had left her mind. She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital.

                                                weak feeling; heartbeat climb up and up; unnerving; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 77-year-old female patient received dose 2 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EN5318; expiration date 31May2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Concomitant medications included losartan, escitalopram, and atorvastatin from unknown dates for unspecified indications. The patient received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (lot number EL1284; left arm) on 15Jan2021 at 11:00. The patient previously received codeine on an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced allergy. On 06Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced a weak feeling and heartbeat climb up. The patient had a weak feeling, had to sit down and took her pulse with oximeter and her Apple watch. She watched her heartbeat climb up and up. She tried yoga breathing but could not slow it down. She was not sure how long this went on because it was very unnerving, but it reached as high as 105 before it started to go down. The beats went up, then down, finally started to keep going down. Once more there was a wave of the weakness through her before she stayed in the 73&#43; range. The patient was usually in the 60&#39;s. Since then the patient&#39;s heartbeats have been what is usual for her. During the episode the patient&#39;s husband found &#34;rapid heartbeat&#34; on the paper they received. The patient was concerned this happened a day after the vaccine, not within an hour. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient was not hospitalized and did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcomes of weak feeling and rapid heartbeat were recovered. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on 20Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in right arm to prevent covid. Vaccination Facility Type was Health department. Medical history included rotator cuff challenge. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccine was administered on the same date. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events were following prior vaccinations. Patient was calling about Pfizer Covid vaccine. She had the first shot on 20Jan2021. She did not have a reaction. She went to go get her monthly massage on Saturday (23Jan2021). On Sunday morning (24Jan2021) she started to feel ill and she had to go the hospital. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital. She had chills, aches and pains, it felt like an elephant was on her chest, she had chest spasms, a fever a little shy of 101. She went to hospital and the doctor there told her she had covid since she had all the symptoms. She confirmed she did not have covid and had a negative covid test. She had chest x-ray and an EKG since she thought she was having a heart attack. Reported her massage was primarily on her left shoulder, it was a deep massage on that area since she had a rotator cuff challenge, massage was focused on that shoulder. She was thinking that the vaccine activated all that discomfort since she felt it from the left part of shoulder, went down to her chest like a v, and back up to her right shoulder. Every time she took a breath she had a chest spasm and it was hard to breathe. The events required a visit to emergency room. For treatment, they gave her medication to take called robaxin, it was an anti-spasm, and 800mg of ibuprofen. She took robaxin Sunday night, Monday, and she took one on Tuesday since she was feeling better. She was sensitive to medication. She felt dizzy and nausea from Robaxin. The patient had recovered from the events completely by Wednesday on 27Jan2021. She had a reminder to return for the second dose on 10Feb2021. She was asking if she should get the second dose.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

They had to put me into another room that was much cooler and put me into a recliner with feet up, ice behind my neck and on my forehead. I was pushing water so it was not dehydration, and I had eaten my normal healty breakfast also so not low blood sugar. This was my second shot and I had the same reaction with the first shot. It took about an hour before I could stand and walk again, but was still a bit shaky and faintly light headed for about another hour.

                                                March 12, 2021 - On Friday about 2pm, I started with a runny nose ? by Sunday afternoon it was like a faucet turned on ? running down my face. March 13 - Saturday morning, I started coughing c chest congestion, and had Phlegm rattling in my chest, started sneezing very frequently/ some diarrhea.  Otherwise, I felt fine. March 14 - Sunday morning, I started wheezing slightly, coughing more and sneezing frequently.  Felt fine.  Went shopping.  Nose ran so much in store, had to run to the store to get paper towels to catch it.  Later, when I carried a heavy bag of groceries from one car 12 feet to another, noticed I was very exhausted and had to rest about 15 minutes before driving home.  Wheezing more. Monday, March 15, I took my B/P meds at 1:00am and my blood pressure was way up x 4 (160?s/ 70?s) p58-64,  at 2:08am ? B/P was 183/92) so I took my PRN Clonidine and ate all the high Potassium foods I had in the house.   By 3:40am my B/P was 120/66 but went back up later with coughing.  I felt fine but tired. A little after 4am,  I carried a bag of apples and a bag of oranges up my stairs and was totally exhausted ? I felt the energy draining out of me, and so was out of breath I dropped the bags on the floor and  sat hyperventilating to get enough air in my lungs until I could breathe normally ? for 40 minutes -  it felt like fluid building in my lungs.  I started massaging my abdomen like crazy and coughing until it subsided ? considering whether I should go to E.R.  My breathing did get some better But I sure did not exert myself.  Just picking up my computer was taking my energy. Still coughing and getting rid of some phlegm.  This was very scary and I was on the verge of going to the E.R.   at 4:45am - I called the E.R. who said I probably could wait for a urgent care to open or talk to Dr.?s office.  My breathing was some better.  By 6:10am I was so tired I fell asleep.   At 10am my B/P was 138/77 p53.  Still very weak, coughing, wheezing, and trying to get rid of phlegm. I had no other symptoms.   I called my Dr. who got me in a urgent care in her building at 3pm.  That evening I started Postural Drainage which helped in getting rid of the phlegm.  I have continued that still. March 16 ? I ?chatted? my doctor to let her know all that was going on.  She scheduled me to see the Respiratory office in her building on the next day.  I was feeling much better ? little nasal dripping, lungs felt better,  March 17 ? Wednesday ? went to Respiratory appt but declined treatment because I felt so much better. More energy, better lungs than Tuesday, wheezing gone, less phlegm, still some coughing ? which is okay with me.  I think this is a severe enough reaction that I should not have the second dose ? which is known to be more severe than the first.

She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included: cholesterol, spinal fusion L4/5, stenosis, allergies to medications, food, or other products: kefex, Zithromax, levofloxacin, oxycontin, methylprednisolone, Lisinopril, ezetimibe, Amlodipine.  She reported she has constant spiking of her blood pressure (BP) and lack of sleep for 37 days (average 1-3 hours daily), since the vaccination. She described the following: She has experienced &#34;dizziness, blurred vision at times, extreme and constant headaches, tons and tons of pain in her neck&#34;. She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function&#34;. When she &#34;lays down&#34;, her &#34;heart is racing so fast and [her] BP gets so high that it won&#39;t let [her] sleep&#34;. She feels like her &#34;body is going crazy&#34;. She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours. So weak &amp; constant neck pain that feels like someone is placing pressure around my neck. The blood pressure medication received are the following: Amlodipine from 1Feb2021 until 9Feb2021. She explained it work well to manage her BP but she &#34;could not urinate and had red flashes in [her] face&#34;; therefore, it was stopped by her cardiologist. She was off the BP medication from 9Feb2021 until 17Feb2021. Metoprolol from 18Feb2021 until 25Feb2021, but it didn&#39;t work. She explained it was stopped by her doctor because of side effects. Propranolol in combination with Alprazolam as needed for anxiety. She explained she &#34;took 3&#34; of the tablets for anxiety. Hydralazine 25mg which she started yesterday, after seeing her cardiologist. She explained she only got 3 hours of sleep last night. She woke up around 1:30am/2am&#34; her heartrate was at &#34;93&#34; and she put heat and cold on her neck to settle the pain. She specified the headache and pain were so bad it lasted for 1.5 hours, and her BP was 150/93 at 3 am .She added she had a &#34;red and flushed face&#34; and therefore took a &#34;Benadryl at 4am&#34;. She explained her BP was down to &#34;125/78&#34;, after taking the Benadryl, but got up to &#34;147/90&#34; at 7 am when she attempted to call Pfizer. She explained she has &#34;done [her] due diligence: she consulted HCP, did all the test, she attempted to go for walks and do activities she can tolerate, but her symptoms persist. She added she use to golf and cannot anymore. She explained her symptoms are persisting until this day and her body won&#39;t handle it further. She mentioned she knows she is COVID-19 free because when helping take care of her quadriplegic son in the summer, she tested negative. Outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : PFIZER INC-2021277006 same patient, different vaccine dose/AE.

                                                She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

Took ekg, drew blood to see if anything was not correct, had chest X-ray. All came out fine  except ekg. Did not settle down.  ER doctor called my doctor and he said other AFib patients have had this happen also. Er doctor agreed with my doctor. Also had no chest pains or shortness of breath or dizziness. Told to take Tylenol for a couple days and was released. The erratic and fast pace of my heart has eased some but still persists.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 25Mar2021 10:00 (batch/lot number EP6955 and expiry date not reported) at 77 years of age as single dose for covid-19 immunization in a clinic facility and not in military facility. Medical history included Stroke from 2014 and another in Dec2018; the patient had MRI to confirm, ongoing blood thinner (therapy). Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) taken for blood thinner from Jan2019 and ongoing. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 04Mar2021 at 77 year of age for covid-19 immunization and experienced arm soreness, Eliquis for 2.5 years after the first stroke for blood thinner and couldn&#39;t deal with Eliquis very well and made her feel like she was dying. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 30Mar2021, the patient experienced TIA (transient ischaemic attack). The patient informed that at first she had nothing then five days after the second dose (30Mar2021), she had a TIA. The TIA that she experienced was so sudden and so alarming. It affected her balance and walking (unspecified date). The patient informed that when she was walking to pick up a stick she felt out of balance. The patient was walking like she was a drunken sailor and was staggering. It was the oddest thing. The patient has not talked to her doctor. The TIA was quick then it was gone. It was scary. The patient did not seek treatment (no treatment received). The outcome of the event TIA was recovered on 30Mar2021, while unknown for the rest of the events. The patient considered that the TIA may have had nothing to do with the shot, it happened 5 days later.

This 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0171), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies and sinus headaches which she takes (Excedrin) off and on for years in the past, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included atenolol (manufacturer unknown) taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported. Past drug history included the patient received a flu shot (unspecified Flu shot) with a mega reaction she was sick for weeks which was at least probably 15-20 years ago So, she never got a flu shot after that and she has never had the flu. On 29Apr2021, the patient had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, dizzy/light headed, felt like I am going to faint, and ringing in the ears. On an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced allergic reaction. On 01May2021, she was really ill, and her blood pressure went up over 220 and pulse rate went way up. On 02May2021, she experienced headaches. On 06May2021, she was feeling a little weird and nauseous. On an unspecified date in May2021, her memory is a little off right now. The clinical course was as follows: the patient reported, &#34;I had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, it&#39;s okay now, I couldn&#39;t really move it. I feel I may be having a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine) got on Thursday (29Apr2021) of this past week. I am very light headed, dizzy and felt like I am going to faint, has ringing in the ears, and all that has been going on about a week, since last Thursday (29Apr2021). Then I was really ill last night (01May2021). It started last night when we went to bed around 11 O&#39;clock. I have never had anything like this in my life. My blood pressure was through the roof. With a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope, her blood pressure went up over 220 which was so high that had never happened before, so I took an extra pill (atenolol 25 mg tablet) last night (01May2021) which helped a little bit but not enough, and I really thought that I was going to pass out and be really sick. Because I thought that it was either having a stroke or a heart attack, my husband had to call ambulance to take me to the hospital last night. The systolic and diastolic and pulse rate went way up.  They did chest x-ray, blood work, and urinalysis, and everything came back fine and they could not find anything. They just felt that I was just having a major reaction to the shot so they sent me home. I just got home this morning (02May2021) from having to go to the emergency room. But as soon as we got home, I started with a humongous headache and so I had Excedrin/Tylenol for headaches because I used to get sinus headaches. So, I took that, and it helped a little bit, my headache got a little better. Anyhow, I am much better right now and I am sleeping. But tomorrow it will be the same.&#34; Later the patient also reported, &#34;Today (06May2021) I am feeling a little weird with ringing of ears and is light headed sometimes. Because of the light headedness, I feels a little nauseous. But I am a still very nauseous. I feel like I am going to faint again and my blood pressure I think has gone back up. I am trying to keep calm and trying to figure out what is going on. But I am really afraid if I am having a reaction to the vaccine unfortunately. I am dizzy and I do not want to start getting worst again. I guess I will feel better if you tell me that this happens sometimes and what can I do to decrease somehow?&#34; She also stated that she did contact her doctor about this event but she didn&#39;t get very far. Her memory is a little off right now because she really has not felt well. She stated that her biggest thing is her blood pressure. She also stated, &#34;The only thing that I am really concerned now is about getting the second shot because I already had the reactions by the first shot. Am I going to face the same thing or even the worse with the second shot?&#34; Treatments were received for her blood pressure went up over 220 and headaches. The clinical outcomes of the event &#34;a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine&#34; resolved on 01May2021, the event nauseous was not resolved, while the events, allergic reaction, really ill, felt like I am going to faint, pulse rate went way up, ringing in the ears, dizzy/light headed, Headaches, feeling a little weird and memory is a little off right now were unknown.

                                                getting lightheaded; Excessive hypertension/ 180/88 to 94; This is spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reported for herself. A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as 2ND DOSE SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, stroke when she was 40, had COVID in Mar2020 (Her cardiologist believes she had COVID too but never did a test) and broke her ankle. Concomitant medication included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN) because she had a stroke and broke her ankle and got a clot from her ankle to her groin; ongoing diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE) taken for paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and hypertension; Chlorthalidone taken for polyuria and hypertension; verapamil hydrochloride (VERAPAMIL) taken for paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for years. Patient received first dose of bnt162b2 on 28Feb2021 in left upper arm. Patient was a retired nurse and stated about a month after the second dose of the vaccine she started getting lightheaded, she went to Urgent Care because her daughter who is a nurse insisted. Her blood pressure at Urgent Care was really, really high, she was having excessive hypertension. Before the vaccine she was on a blood pressure medication for several years and had no issues. She went to see her cardiologist and they moved her from one medication to 3 medications (then add Losartan, Diltiazem) to get this controlled. In the morning she was lightheaded and her blood pressure is high before her morning medication. Diltiazem is 24 hours. She gets up at 3AM and once she takes the medication it seems to be ok. Her blood pressure is reasonable now. It is not like it was initially when elevated. Initially it was 180/88 to 94 when she first went to see the cardiologist after second COVID19 Vaccine. Currently her blood pressure in the morning is usually 154/ 77. That was when she first takes it when she gets up. Later in the morning it is running 110/77. The event outcome was unknown. She was feeling that it had to do with the second injection. Patient considered it was medically significant for high blood pressure and lightheaded, and considered both events related to COVID19 Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the known drug profile, there is a reasonable possibility of casual relationship between the drug BNT162b2 and the events Dizziness and Hypertension. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                major bleed; GI bleed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 77-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) (Lot Number: EN6200) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included first time she experienced bleeding was in 2013 because of aspirin. Stated that she decided it was a good idea to take baby aspirin so she took it on her own. She was told don&#39;t ever take aspirin ever again and she didn&#39;t have any problem until Nov2020. That was the first incident, in 2013, that told her she should not take blood thinner. They took her off the blood thinner in Nov2020. She had been taking aspirin. She lost half her blood; she lost it two settings. She sat down to take a bowel movement and was told she lost half of her blood. Not sure when she started Aspirin but she stopped it in 2013. It was mentioned that she could take aspirin. She was on a low dose of Eliquis for atrial fibrillation for prevention of a blood clots or heart attack.  she had bleeding in the last year. The one that was the most was back in Nov2020; it was more pronounced. Mentioned that she went in on 12Nov2020 for the bleeding and then had to go back in because her legs were swelling. She stopped taking Eliquis in Nov2020 and from then until Apr2021 she had no bleeding. It was several years ago when she was diagnosed. She was riding her bike in the neighborhood, and felt too tired so she stopped at the doctor and went in and told them she felt weird, they couldn&#39;t get her BP and took her to the hospital and her heart rate was sky high like 250. They said she might had to have electric. She didn&#39;t have any pain but states she was psychologically freaked out by everyone running around. Mentioned that, she was first placed on dronedarone (MULTAQ) 400mg twice daily to treat her atrial fibrillation; she can&#39;t remember the year. After taking it as prescribed for some time she got atrial fibrillation again. She was told by the doctor it had lost its efficacy. Concomitant medications included Fenofibrate taken for blood cholesterol, Metoprolol succinate taken for blood pressure, Vitamins NOS, Ferrous Sulfate taken for anemia, Vitamin D3 all are ongoing. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3246) on 06Feb2021 in arm left for covid-19 immunization.

A 77-years-old female consumer (patient) reported for herself that she received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient previously took tylenol as per her common sense and epipens (double dose) for swollen mouth and lips (due to a cleaner) two months ago. Concomitant medications were not reported. As per the description, it was reported that the patient was scared because she didn&#39;t had anyone. She was hesitated to get a vaccine. She experienced some reactions after her 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Her joint hurt and she was in a bad situation. She had a very low temperature than the normal temperature, blood pressure was high when she got upset. She was very angry that she had fever and had nobody to ask a question. She reported that no one told her about a high fever (100.4) or to go to the hospital. She said it was not worth it for her to get a fever. She reported the information on the paper was very vague and not clear, she felt horrible as she suffered and wanted to let know. She wanted to complain that the temperature of fever was not written and none of those were approved. She was asked to contact her local doctor. That was the most horrible experience for her. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement as high, body temperature as and 100.4. The outcome of all the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

She tried to take off her sweatshirt and her arm froze--this is the last thing she remembers.  Husband called 911 and she went to the ER.  She had had a seizure and they found 2  brain lesions. She had a CT scan and an MRI in the ER.   There was memory loss in the beginning and slurring of words.  She felt a weighty fatigue.  Was put on Keppra for seizures.  Had consults with neurology, a neurosurgeon, a neuro-oncologist--all unsure of what exactly these brain lesions were.   Back left lower part of brain:  a small lesion, which was basically ignored Right side, towards front, part of brain, on top of and/or intertwined with motor strip:  not sure what this is, a stroke or tumor (the neurosurgeon and neurologist had differing opinions) 2/22--1st MRI--shows 2 spots  between these 2 MRIs the bloodwork, CT scan, and ultrasound are done--results normal 3/23--2nd MRI--larger lesion is bigger.  Was not thought to be a cancerous tumor 4/23--3rd MRI--Looks like larger lesion is improving.  A scheduled brain biopsy is postponed 5/20--4th MRI--the small spot is almost gone and the larger spot is much smaller, about 1/8th the size of the February MRI.  According to the neuro-oncologist, this was an atypical stroke.

She is a shell of who she was and our family just simply misses her,I truly just wish that we would have had been warned of the possible risks to patients like her prior to getting the vaccine.No matter how small the possibility of adverse reaction.We would have chosen to keep her longer.

                                                I first lost my nail. It was unusual because there was no trauma to the nail. I was reaching for something across my bed, and I started experiencing radiating pain across my chest as well as pressure. I stayed very still and then it spread through my left arm and up into my shoulder, neck ear and jaw. I remained still and tried breathing the best I could. This lasted a minute or two and then it released and was over. About a month later, I was diagnosed with RSV which ran down into my lungs and soon my blood pressure was going up because my heart was working so hard to breathe. It was over 200/175 which is abnormal for me. I had to end up calling an ambulance because I was having trouble breathing. I was prescribed blood pressure medication, steroids, antibiotics, prednisone and oxygen. I was not allowed to get out of bed, I couldn&#39;t walk. They told me it would take baby steps.

She thought it would be temporary and go away, but did not.  She came home, and it was still happening, still having them.  She talked to her daughter and went to the ER.  They did an EKG and blood work for fear of having a heart attack, all was negative.  Didn&#39;t do anything more for her.  After 3 hours and moved to a chair and then it suddenly stopped.  She did have this reaction for about 5 hours.   Still feeling tired but not sure if it was from weather or stress itself.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 16:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney ablation (ablation on the kidney cancer 5 years ago), kidney cancer, blood pressure, neuropathy, pain, had a urinary tract infection 19Dec2020 and they saw the cancer came back, radiologist read the CAT Scan and said the size of the tumor 1.5 to 2.4. Concomitant medications included acebutolol for blood pressure taking for years, diclofenac for neuropathy using for 10 years, oxycodone for pain taking 19 years; all ongoing, and oxycodone hydrochloride (OXYCONTIN) for pain. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Family Medical History was none. The caller stated that he was not sure if the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have given patient (his wife) COVID-19 or not. He also stated that when they received their vaccines the facility was very crowded as was the hospital when the wife was getting her blood work done so he was not sure when or where she contracted COVID-19. On 29Jan2021, patient was very busy running several errands including going to the hospital for bloodwork and a nuclear medicine injection as part of a work up for kidney ablation that the patient was supposed to have completed, patient was in the process of getting ready to have an ablation on her kidney and had the nuclear scan for her kidneys and then went to get a COVID test. After they got home, patient sat down at the computer and she started to act funny, kind of quiet and not talking which was unusual for her. So at about 1700PM the husband went in to ask her what kind of music she would like and he found her unconscious in the chair. He took her blood pressure and it was 60 over 4; with no heart rate; she was just barely breathing, he could tell by the way her mouth moved. He tried to breath for her, all of the sudden she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. He called (phone number provided) and they rushed her to the hospital, and the paramedics verified her heart was not beating and they started to do resuscitation. Then they finally pulled her out of the chair and put her on the floor and she started to breath. When they took her to the ambulance she was still not quite coherent; she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She was taken to the hospital emergency room and stayed there for 12 hours and they monitored her with an EKG and only saw one spike for 6 seconds. They discharged her on 30Jan2021 afternoon and she has been totally normal 100 percent since then. Since she had been home she had been doing well and has had no other events. Added patient had never had a heart problem before. Caller stated that he was not sure if this event was related to her receiving the vaccine or not. Now they had to stay in quarantine 10 days until 08Feb2021 since the COVID test given at the hospital on 29Jan2021 night when she went in was positive. Patient was scheduled to received the second shot 18Feb2021. Outcome of events unconscious, no heart rate, pressure was 60 over 4 was recovered on 29Jan2021, events started to act funny and stopped breathing was recovered on 30Jan2021, outcome of other events was unknown. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, patient was taken to the ER and monitored for 12 hours but no admission. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.

This 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL963), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 12:00 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included borderline high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Hashimoto&#39;s, hypothyroid. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included rosuvastatin, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL), hydrochlorothiazide and lisinpro received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took ezetimibe (ZETIA) and experienced drug allergy. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. After sitting in recovery room for about 10 minutes following injection patient began to feel strange. Patient called the nurse on duty and said she felt like her heart was racing. The nurse took her BP and pulseox and administered a mini EKG. Then the nurse called the EMT on duty who gave patient a six leader EKG and said patient was in A Fib. Asked if patient had ever had A fib before, patient said no. Then asked if patient wanted to go to the hospital, patient said no. After sitting with the EMT for five minutes or so another EKG showed patient was no longer in A Fib. Patient felt shaky for the rest of the day, but is normal now. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received for the adverse event. Outcome of the events was recovering.

She wondered if she should call Fire Dept (but wasn?t making total sense).  Her friend came, tried to help, but I think she decided to call 911 for help getting her up &amp; wants EMTs to check her out.  **She had fallen during Covid, went to ER &amp; they gave fluids &amp; she was ?good? for a week, but then dizzy &amp; severe lethargy, same friend took her to ER &amp; she was admitted (negative covid test at that point), but very large PE, thus heparin &amp; then Eliquis (Dec 2020).

A 78-years-old female patient receive first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) on 15Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID Prevention. Medical history included ongoing High Blood Pressure, she was diagnosed approximately 5 years prior to starting blood pressure medications in 1998. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) at 320mg/12.5mg, once daily, by mouth from 1998 and ongoing, amlodipine besylate at 5mg, once daily, by mouth at night from 1998, both for High blood pressure. The patient stated that she did not realize, but she must have been exposed to the COVID Virus, prior to getting her shot. She stated that on 15Jan2021, she went and got her Pfizer COVID shot, and that same day, by the time she got home, she was starting to feel bad and it went downhill from there. She mentioned that on the same day on 15Jan2021, she &#34;came down with covid&#34;. She finally went in on 22Jan2021, and got tested, and she did test positive for COVID. The patient was tested Positive for COVID-19 on 22Jan2021. She did believe she was getting better. On 29Jan2021, she felt fairly decent, and today, she is kind of weak but she is assuming that will happen. She was scheduled to go back for her second dose on 08Feb2021, and she is wondering if there are recommendations about the second dose, for people who tested positive for COVID after having gotten the first dose. When queried for her PCP contact information, she stated that her head is not working really great and she feels stupid she did not have this information handy to provide. She states that the first week with her symptoms, she just figured she did have the virus. She had a cough but it never got down to where she had trouble breathing, and she just figured that her body had to go through, whatever it was going to go through, and as long as the patient felt like she was okay, there was not anything anyone could do, she just had to play it out. When she did finally go get tested, the doctor told her to get on Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what the patient has been taking, and she feels like it has helped a lot. Before she saw the doctor, she was taking Acetaminophen, but the doctor told her to do the Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what she has been doing. By the time she got home from getting her vaccine, her heart was racing. She took her blood pressure and it was okay at 125/73, and her heart rate was 72. She has high blood pressure and she takes two medications for that, so she took her night time blood pressure pill and the fast beating of her heart went away. The next day, she got to aching. She has had all different aches, and she ran a fever that got up to 101, and the rest of the time it was 100 or 99, but the fevers were not all day long, they would just come and go. Now she has had no fever in four or more days, and she is doing better. She does still have the cough, but she also has allergies so she does not know what is causing the cough. As far as the reaction to the vaccine, just her arm got sore. But she thinks she was exposed prior to getting the vaccine and just did not know it. she stated that the people took her temperature the day of the shot and she didn&#39;t have a temperature. She did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of fever was recovering, of cough and allergies was not recovered, of her heart was racing was recovered.

The following information was gathered from discussion with RPH at Hospital. The patient received second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/26/2021. The patient then had nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. On 2/27/2021, the patient went to the bathroom and while on the toilet, had a vasovagal event which led to her hitting the side of the face while falling. Patient was then taken to the hospital for evaluation. The patient does have a pacemaker but the cause of the event was determined to likely be due to dehydration. Lab work was performed and pertinent lab values include: potassium of 3.1, SCr of 0.8, and BUN of 13. The patient received potassium supplementation and IV hydration in the hospital. Patient was discharged on 2/28/2021. Of note, the patient does have a pacemaker and a follow-up appointment with cardiology to evaluate the pacemaker was scheduled upon discharge.

Next morning, 02/23/2021 around 6am could not lift my head off pillow, the room and everything was spinning around. I called my husband and he tried to get me to sit up but i could not. He took my blood pressure and it was in the high 165&#43; so he called our neighbor who is a registered nurse, she took the blood pressure and now 179&#43; and kept going up and at 190&#43; she called 911 and they took me to the ER at the hospital, they took the blood pressure and it was 212. At the hospital it reached 237 but the dizziness was going away. I came home around 3:14pm. Follow up visit with my doctor on 2/26 and 3/15 by phone call going over testresults. Some of the tests given on 03/02 Electrocardiographics &amp; Vascular lab. Then on 03/15 more test MRI and MRIA. Than on the last Dr. office visit on 03/15 all tests were clean. Before the last visit we did a lot of checking around with people we know (doctors and nurses) about what was going on and mentioned about the Covid-19 vaccine shot given the day before and they mentioned that people were getting dizziness and some vertigo also one we talked with was a nurse, who missed two days of work because she as dizzy the day after the vaccine. So I mentioned this to the Doctor who said he has heard the same thing. He said that this could have caused what happened to me

                                                it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours; it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours; blood pressure went up to 198/203; still has tiredness; difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight; difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight; short of breath; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 11:00, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included silent heart attack, ongoing Barrett&#39;s oesophagus from 2008, fall she had over two months (2021), eye surgery on an unknown date. She does not get any shots and can&#39;t have shots even for the flu shot because she had problems with two flu shots she had; states she had a problem with each one of the flu shots and does not know the names of the flu shots and has no lot numbers to provide for them; states she had the flu shots in the early 1990&#39;s and worked in healthcare and had to have them and they told her back then if she wanted to work she had to have the flu shots and then she got sick with both of the flu shots and they said they guessed they would not force her to have the flu shots. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose administered and then about 14 hours after (12Mar2021) that she had no problems until it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours. She does not know what to do about getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine and was at her cardiologist&#39;s this week and he said he is not familiar with the Pfizer vaccine causing chest pain; caller states she has a history of silent heart attacks. She still has tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight and they told her to mention if she does go for the second dose of the vaccine to mention that she had this situation.The chest pain and arm pain began 12Mar2021 and the arm pain is in her right arm where the vaccine was administered and the arm pain and chest pain have resolved; states the arm pain and chest pain stopped and she thinks that lasted about an hour and a half and she called a family member to take her to the hospital; states about 2:30am that same day she was admitted the morning of 12Mar2021 and was discharged on 13Mar2021. They ran every test known to the patient and for a while her blood pressure went up to 198/203 in the emergency room (12Mar2021) and she is not on any medication; caller states she does have Crestor but has not started on it and has not taken it yet. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight began the same time she was having the chest pain and she is not having any chest pain or anything like that right now but the tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight is still ongoing; states she did go get cardiac clearance to make sure which was this past week and she does not feel well and like for her the tiredness is bugging her. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing are better but she knows they are there and she tries to swallow something and is like boy her throat is still tight. They did an ultrasound in her left leg because she was limping from a fall she had over two months ago but still has a sore ankle from that and they sent her down for the ultrasound and a CT looking for blood clots in her lungs because she was short of breath (12Mar2021); caller states she thinks they were running everything they could to rule out things; states everything was negative for the CT and ultrasound and she believes the CT and ultrasound were done on 12Mar2021. She has no idea when she was diagnosed with silent heart attacks but they kept asking her about this when she went in for eye surgery and asked her when she had a heart attack and she said she had never had one and they said yes she had and she never knew. She just set up a HCP appointment after the reported events with a gastroenterologist because she has Barrett&#39;s and because of the esophagus she did not know if it flared up by the Pfizer vaccine and that caused the pain because the two pains of the heart and esophagus mimic each other with pain going up into the jaw so they were ruling out which one it was; states she went out as an atypical chest pain and called the cardiologist and went in and went over her records from the hospital with the cardiologist. She does not know what caused what in terms of the pain. The outcome of the event blood pressure increased was unknown, chest pain and pain in arm was recovered, other events was recovering.

                                                passed out for a very short period of  time; was awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking; her body felt warm but then she was freezing; her body felt warm but then she was freezing; was sick and was different and very weak; muscles were sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Mar2021 12:10 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine on 23Feb2021 (lot number: EN6198 with expiry date 31May2021) for Covid-19 immunization. The patient experienced passed out for a very short period of  time and awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking on 18Mar2021; her body felt warm but then she was freezing, she was sick and was different and very weak, and muscles were sore in Mar2021. It was further reported that the patient got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine that day on 17Mar2021 and about 12:45am or 1:30am the next morning she was awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking; the shaking has resolved completely but she is not sure when it resolved but she was shaking for a good while because she can remember being so uncomfortable with her body moving so much which went on for maybe 20 minutes or so when her husband woke up.Patient&#39;s husband then woke up and got Ibuprofen and gave it to her and that stopped the shaking which surprised her and she did not know the Ibuprofen would work to stop the shaking that well and the Ibuprofen did work in stopping the shaking. The Ibuprofen stopped the shaking and she can remember to touch her body felt warm but then she was freezing and she does not know what this means but this was not ongoing and resolved when her husband gave her the ibuprofen and she stopped shaking right away which always amazed her that the Ibuprofen worked. She stated fortunately the Ibuprofen stopped her from shaking and she was able to sleep until early morning when she woke up and knew she was sick and was different and very weak; states the weakness was not ongoing and the approximate time the weakness resolved was unknown but she was down the rest of the day and after that she passed out for a very short period of  time and held her head up and stood up and thought wow something was going on and asked where was this coming from and it was not nausea but she was just weak. She has not passed out for a huge amount of time but fortunately she had some towels laying close by and was able to use a towel; states after that she stopped for the rest of the day and only got up to go to the potty and was just so weak and heard that from many people that they just slept afterwards.Caller states her muscles were sore and she realized that was just normal and after the 2nd dose of the vaccine she knew her muscles would probably be sore and this was resolved. She came downstairs and was sitting on a chair and then stood and no longer sat in the chair and her husband knew things were not right with her and her eyes looked funny and she passed out and that never happened to her before and she was passed out for a few moments. Other than the Ibuprofen she did not have treatment and did not go to the emergency room or the HCP office. Patient only took one Ibuprofen and she has a very small body and her husband sometimes takes 2-3 Ibuprofen and she thinks wow that is so many but she herself does not have any medication and she just took one Ibuprofen and it worked; She took the Ibuprofen on 18Mar2021 in the early morning. Fortunately she was in good health. Outcome of the event passed out for a very short period of  time, was awakened by total body shaking and it was not just shivers but was uncontrollable shaking and muscles were sore was recovered in Mar2021, and unknown outcome for the remaining events.

                                                On 2/18/21, 10 days after receiving the vaccine, I donated blood as usual.  About 30 minutes later I was light headed, had abdominal cramping pain, bowel emptying and possibly fainted.  I was transported by EMTs to the ER and was later diagnosed with inflamitory bowel by a CT scan.  I took antibiotics and was feeling fine.  My gastroenterologist performed a colonoscopy on 3/24/21 and the findings were that I was healed and tissue samples were normal.  3/25/21 I had an annual physical and was told I was in good health.  Later that afternoon I began feeling light headed upon standing.  In the night I called my health insurance hotline because my blood oxygen meter was beeping  continuously.  The Dr. on call told me to go by ambulance to the ER.  When sitting or lying down, I felt fine and all the tests at the ER for my heart and my vital signs were good.  A few hours later, they did a hest Xray and then a CT scan of my lungs which showed a saddle embulism.  I had also  thought I had bruised my knee if and when I fainted on 2/18 and  1o hours later a blood lot was found by ultrasound of my left knee.  I was given blood thinners in the ER and then in ICU where I spent the next night.  I am now taking Eleris.  I was also given pantoprozole for GERD coughing the next day.  I continue to have periods of abdominal ramping/pain, light headedness in waves and pressure in my head.  I have disontinued the stomach medication with some feeling better with the lightheadedness.

Although I am predisposed to heart arrhythmia having been diagnosed with super ventricular tachycardia in late teen years, then atrial fibrillation starting at age 60,  I was getting an episode of a-fib only once every 3-4 months following an ablation procedure.   This was different as I had several episodes in a day on two different days.  They subsided only following the taking of propafenone.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm  on 24Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination 78 years).  The patient medical history was not reported.  On 04Feb2021 the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 and experienced sore arm.   The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced pain with walking left leg  on 28Feb2021 with outcome of recovering , left leg swelling/ it got so swollen/left foot swelling  on 03Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered , numerous blood clots below the knee  on 04Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown results,  ultrasound joint: numerous blood clots below the knee   on 04Apr2021   , vital signs measurement: unknown results.  Course of the event: The patient  waited for the timeframe after the second dose and had no problems. 4 days after, she experienced pain with walking in her left leg.  She took Aleve for a few days.  It got so swollen, she should have gone then to her Primary Medical Doctor, but she did not go until 25Mar2021. She was sent to  Hospital for an Ultrasound of her leg on 04Apr2021.  After the Ultrasound, she was taken to the Emergency Department at the hospital. The doctor told her she had numerous blood clots below the knee.  Was prescribed Eliquis 5mg.  She was instructed to take 2 tablets or 10mg twice a day, 8hrs apart for 1 week and then 1 tablet twice a day for the remainder of the 74 tablets. She completed that. She was out of them and got a refill of Eliquis 5mg on 26Apr2021. She received 60 tablets and can refill for 5 times. She is really concerned. The swelling is still so bad and so that could that mean blood clots are still in there. The ER doctor told her that the medication is dangerous.  It thins the blood and can cause bleeding and the blood clot can go to her heart.  Follow up information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causality has been assessed as related to bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm  on 24Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for covid-19 immunization, based on temporal association and profile of the product.,Linked Report(s) : 2021499984 same patient/drug, diff dose/event

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 78-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL1283) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypo thyroiditis (does not have it anymore, it was 30 years ago when she was a teacher), knee that was broken twice and allergic to antibiotics from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down/something clicks in body, heart beats really fast, really bad pain in her right knee, muscles really tight, didn&#39;t feel so good, she was scared to death, her nerves, anxiety and very frightened. The reporter stated that feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down, was happened after she got her first covid shot. The patient asked to know if it was safe for her to get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient wondered if anyone else, she had the first Pfizer vaccine, later clarified as the COVID vaccine, a week ago last day before the time of this report, and she used to have a really fast heartbeat, but it slowed down, and once in a while, it was fast and stuff, now she had this happened twice, where she felt something click in her body, her heart beats really fast, and she drank water immediately, it slows down, has anyone said this after getting the vaccine. She has been on the phone for two hours. She never had a little click, she had thyroid hypo thyroiditis and every evening she would have a fast heartbeat, her blood pressure would go, but she never had when she would feel this little click, like a little, and her heart was really fast in morning of the report, it was really fast, and the minute she drinks water, it slows it down, it does not make sense. Also, her muscles are really tight, she was 78 and having a hard time with this pandemic, her nerves not good, she was nervous about the vaccine. She stated she was a teacher, and her weight was 106-107 pounds. About the event feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down/something clicks in body, heart beats really fast, the patient stated, unknown when this started, exact date unknown, this has happened twice, this morning was the second one, and the minute she drank water, it slows it down, but it was very very fast, and she did not feel so good after, she was scared to death, her nerves are shot, she has trouble with anxiety, she was feeling ok now. She was nervous about what was going on and would feel better if someone else said they experienced the same. About the event muscles being really tight, the patient stated she has knots, her muscles are tight in her shoulders and neck lots, last night she was writing recipes, she does recipes boxes for her grandkids, and she was using her right arm a lot, she does not get to go to spa since the pandemic, she has not gotten to go to her for over a year. Her husband rubbed it out, and she did heat. Her muscles were tight right after she did it, so it could be something, it said if you think you had a symptom and also the second night after, she had a really bad pain in her right knee, it lasted one night, it was a knee that was broken twice, which may be why it was that leg. She was very very frightened to take it, she reacts to things strangely, when she has any procedure, they always say they never had that happen to anyone, she was allergic to antibiotics, different things happen when she takes different things, she was nervous about the whole thing, which may have to do with it. The second dose is on 12Feb2021. The outcome of the event muscles really tight was recovering and unknown for other events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                Feeling unwell; fast heart beat; nauseous; unbalanced when walking; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN9810 and Expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 04Feb2021 14:35 as 1st dose single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included anxiety from Unspecified to Unspecified date. The patient concomitant medication included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for anxiety from Unspecified to Unspecified date. The patient received no other vaccines in the past 4 weeks period. On 05Feb2021, morning, she noticed she is feeling unwell and had a fast heart beat. After eating it got a little better. It says on the paperwork normal side effects to expect like feeling unwell and fast heartbeat which has calm down for her, but she was wondering how long this was expected to last and have the side effect. She was not feeling good this morning. She doesn&#39;t want this to last a long time. The patient reported that after the vaccine she felt nothing, no pain, no pain even at the arm. The patient reported that, she was not completely sure how she was feeling because she was sitting now, she felt nauseous and unbalanced, she was feeling unwell. As she was sitting down, she thinks it was better, but she still feels unbalanced when walking. The patient took half a Xanax when her heartbeat was fast, that was usually the trick that slows it. It was reported that, she takes Xanax for anxiety and maybe that was it was. She took the Xanax because she had to wait on the phone for so long to speak to someone. The second dose was schedule date on 02Mar2021. The patient had so many medications, but had not taken them before this started, she took them later. The patient received list of what she could expect, on the list what she had was a common reaction, but the Fast heart rate was in the call section, but it was not that bad for her to call 911 as she knows a fast heartbeat can happen with her anxiety. She usually gets the flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, she does not remember when she had it last, she usually gets them when it comes out or when pharmacy announces it and asks her. The patient noticed that people who usually get the COVID virus die of Pneumonia, so she thought she would get the pneumonia vaccine. The patient had some exam 2 weeks ago, and yesterday the Physician left a message about the results and did state on the phone that she has nothing to worry about. The outcome of Feeling unwell was not resolved and fast heart beat was resolving.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 79-year-old elderly female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Apr2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.

Additional Context: Consumer states that her doctor wanted her to call and report this, because she has asthma and allergies that are chronic. Consumer states that she took her first Pfizer injection in April. She saw her allergy specialist on the 1st, and she tested the Consumer before she took the vaccine. She states that her breathing was at 113% breathing capacity (good) and the allergy specialist wanted her to go ahead and get the injection, which the Consumer did. Consumer clarifies that she received the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 11Apr2021 and that she did really good with that one. Consumer then received the second COVID vaccine on 13May2021. She came home and slept almost all night long and thought she was okay. The Consumer explains she was not feeling real good before she went to receive her second dose. It was kind of like she was having some coughing and stuff, but she thought it was not bad and that she could still go ahead and get it. She went ahead on 13May2021 and had the second dose. Consumer states that on the first day, she slept all day long- the whole entire day, she didn&#39;t even wake up. On the second day, the Consumer states that she had soreness in her arm. Then, she noticed she was getting really sick and started running a 99.9 temperature. It was getting worse day by day, and she kept coughing and getting worse. Then, on 18May2021, her husband took her to the emergency room and they just automatically treated her for asthma and allergy and sent her home. This was on Tuesday night. On Thursday night, she got so bad that her breathing was down in the danger zone at 220. She couldn&#39;t breathe. Her husband rushed her back to the ER and this time, they kept the Consumer and hospitalized her for a week. Her blood pressure was high. She clarifies normally her breathing on her peak flow meter, she can always do from 350-400. Well on Thursday night, her peak flow was all the way down to 220 and she could not catch her breath. Consumer states that she was admitted to the hospital and they had her on oxygen and blood pressure medication. She states that they did a bronch on her and still did not really come to a conclusion of what was happening. She was told it looked like it could be an infection in her lungs. Consumer states that she is having to see three doctors this week because of this since she got out of the hospital. She saw her medical doctor, Dr., yesterday who was very concerned because she had a recent patient that was about the same age as the Consumer- he was 75 years old. This patient had done the same thing, only he ended up taking pneumonia and dying with it. The doctor told the Consumer in her x-ray, her doctor could see that she had some pneumonia showing. The Consumer asked her doctor while she was in the hospital about the pneumonia and they refused to listen to anything the Consumer said, so Dr. told her that the Consumer needed to report this because she is still so sick. Consumer clarifies that she was hospitalized for a week and that she just got out on Saturday, 29May2021. While reporting the event details, the Consumer stated that she had and emergency call coming through and that she had to take it. Consumer had to end the call, stating she had to go and requested this call handler call her back. The patient was hospitalized due to events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 99.9, peak expiratory flow rate: 220 Units: x-ray: had pneumonia showing. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I went to see my primary care physician&#39;s assistant.  She became alarmed when my heart rate was 141 and insisted I go to the hospital via ambulance right then (May 11, 2021 approximated 10:30 a.m.) I spent the first day in the Emergency Room at Hospital then was admitted  to a private room.  I was discharged on May 14th  with prescriptions for Eliquis, digoxin, lasix, metoprolol, and lisinipril with the hope that m heart would return to normal pulse on its own,  I had a echocardiogram, confirming Atrial Flutter.   had an angiogram and was told there were no blockages.  I had a transesophageal echocardiogram.  It determined the doctor could not safely shock my heart back into rhythm.  I have another scheduled for July 1, 2021.

Then her face ended up developing a long last swelling and rash episode that lasted for 1.5-2 months. Patient thinks it was a reaction to the amoxicillin she was given, but it persisted despite not being on the medicine, being given steroids, and antihistamines. Patient was in the ED twice for the facial swelling. Also saw Dermatology. Pt later saw an allergist and she is not allergic to amoxicillin, only other new thing had been the vaccine when it all started. Then the patient suddenly develops severe bradycardia to the point of syncope and episodes of sinus arrest. Patient then ended up requiring a pacemaker to be placed.

                                                hypertension/Blood pressure high; Really tired; some stuff with her kidneys; This is a spontaneous report a Pfizer Sponsored Program from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 79-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot#: EL8982) on 16Jan2021 14:30 at single dose in right arm for to prevent Covid-19. Medical history included ongoing sjogren&#39;s syndrome, hypertension.  Prior vaccinations, the patient maybe tired and unwell from the flu vaccine and shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for immunization. There were no concomitant medications.  No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient got her first vaccine on 16Jan2021. About 3 days later, on 19Jan2021, she was really tired but it only lasted for that one day. States that on 19Jan2021, 20Jan2021, and 21Jan2021, her blood pressure shot way up and she went to the ER on 21Jan2021 because it had been so high for a few days. States that at home it was 172/104, 172/107, and 200/103. When she got to the ER it was 200/110. States that her blood pressure has improved on it&#39;s own today. While she was in the ER, they checked her Troponin&#39;s which were low, her EKG was normal, and the doctor said everything looked okay, except some stuff with her kidneys but that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with her blood pressure. Before she got the first dose she had a history of hypertension but it was already managed by medication and her BP was on normal range prior to vaccination. The AEs High blood pressure and Really tired require a visit to Emergency room on 21Jan2021. The patient was on BP medications. The patient was hospitalized for hypertension and Really tired. The outcome of hypertension was recovering, of Really tired was recovered on 19Jan2021, of other events were unknown. Second dose was scheduled on 06Feb2021.

A 79-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine; Batch/lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration injection to right upper arm  on 22Jan2021 14:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing she was a fainter (She was a fainter, she just faints so she has a hard time getting shots. Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine administered to her by nurse while she was in her car seat. She just asked the nurse to let her lay down in the car seat when injection was administered so that if she fainted she would not fall far; she was still getting the wash cloth on her head preparing when the Nurse had already finished administering the injection.); ongoing depressed sometimes (she was depressed sometimes, was stressed. She was the primary caregiver for her 96 year old mother. She had seen something about stress and COVID and shots and everything); ongoing  Very tired (She was almost 80 years old so she was very tired often. She was the primary caregiver for her 96 year old mother. By the time she comes home at night around 21:30 she was just wiped.);  Obesity (She was really overweight but she did not like the term obesity.); thyroid disorder; hypertension; Cataract and glaucoma in left eye; family history of ongoing facial paralysis (Dad had Bell&#39;s palsy that might have been 30 years ago. He died at age 87 years.); diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes). Concomitant medication included Levothyroxine at 100mcg taken once daily in the morning early before she eats with Start date unknown, but at least 10-15 years ago for Thyroid. Enalapril at 10mg taken once daily (Caller initially reported product name as Vasotec, but clarified it is not Vasotec, it is drop for eye cataract and glaucoma) for High blood pressure. Brimonidine with Strength unknown, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily, started maybe 1 year ago. Specified cataract and glaucoma in left eye; but drop was administered to both eyes; and left eye was eye affected by Bell&#39;s palsy for Cataract and glaucoma in left eye. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergy with onset maybe about 50 years ago, she was not sure; occurred during dental procedure; had bad headaches but no lasting effects so they assumed allergy to codeine; she did not know if still has allergy but says she does if asked.  The patient experienced bell&#39;s palsy/developed facial drooping/her eye was drooping on 29Jan2021 with outcome of recovering, may have had a mini stroke on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown , fell on 27Jan2021 with outcome of unknown (reported date of end of reaction was 27Jan2021), she could not blink that eye on 29Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered. Five days later she fell and developed facial drooping.  HCP suggested she may have had a mini stroke causing facial drooping and the fall. She went to the ER on 29Jan2021 and the ER believed it was Bell&#39;s Palsy. She was still experiencing facial symptoms but they are improving. This consumer was administered her first dose if Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 22Jan2021. She reported having fell 27Jan2021. She was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy in 29Jan2021 after having been seen in the emergency room. She is supposed to have the second dose/booster of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Feb2021. She called to ask if she should or should not still get the second dose as scheduled; and if Bell&#39;s palsy could be a reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The emergency room staff did not know how she got Bell&#39;s palsy, but knew she had the Pfizer COIVD-19 Vaccine and were kind of assuming the Bell&#39;s palsy was a reaction to the vaccine. She dis not have Bell&#39;s palsy bad. The emergency room staff thought at first she had a stroke before diagnosing her with Bell&#39;s palsy. On Wednesday, 27Jan2021 she had a friend named (Name withheld) who came over for tea. Patient has an oriental rug, and around 15:00 patient fell face first on oriental rug. She was just fine after the fall initially. She wonders if her having fell has anything to do with the Bell&#39;s palsy. She thinks it was the night of 27Jan2021 or 28Jan2021 when she asked her son if her face looked funny, did she look ok, because her face felt a little funny. She was looking in the mirror and her smile was looking crooked, and her eye looked like it was drooping. When she got up Friday, 29Jan2021 she could see her eye was drooping, and she could not blink that eye. She called her Ophthalmologist who saw her the afternoon of 29Jan2021 around 13:30-13:55. The Ophthalmologist said yeah something is going on with that eye. Her friend called his friend who is a Pediatric Neurologist that advised her to go to the emergency room.  She was seen in the emergency room of (Hospital name withheld) around 17:00 on 29Jan2021. She was not admitted to the hospital at that time; but was evaluated and treated. She Bell&#39;s palsy outcome: she is doing so much better. She still has a hard time blinking her left eye, she still cannot blink her bad eye: left eye, without also closing her good eye: right eye. She is not drooling, she can drink without drooling. Her smile is still just a little crooked. She was given 2 prescriptions in the emergency room which were Prednisone and Valtrex. On 29Jan2021 in the emergency room they did tests including testing her heart with EKG; X-ray of her heart or lungs or something; took blood tests; and continuously took her blood pressure.

The patient reported that she had her shot this morning (29Jan2021) at about 08:30 and towards evening, the shot started to hurt and so she wanted to make sure that it didn&#39;t go against anything, and put a little ice on it or maybe it was worthless on ice on certain situations after the fact that she thought this was too late. She wanted to make sure she could do that. The patient&#39;s blood pressure also went up on 29Jan2021. She was taking several different medicines for blood pressure. She took them already tonight. She was hoping that she will be feeling a little bit better. Sometimes, she gets a little fever on Jan2021, also like maybe 99 (unspecified). She just wanted to know if any of the medications were good or not for the shot. The patient was asking whether the drugs interacted. The patient also reported that when she took her first shot, she had a little fever and asked what she could take for it. An agent stated that she could take paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient mentioned that she took her pills, otherwise, her head felt like it was going to explode on Jan2021. She took her high blood pressure medicines. She has three medications namely clonidine, losartan and propranolol. She has a lot of medical conditions that was why she was calling because she takes other medications. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                short of breath; nose bleed/lost a lot of blood/bleeding; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9263 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization, and eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (VASCEPA), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); both via unspecified route of administration from unspecified date to 31Jan2021 at unknown dose and frequency for unspecified indication. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient had taken the first shot of the Pfizer shot on 26Jan2021 (Tuesday) and the patient seemed to managing it pretty well, she got short of breath one night (unspecified date) but in general, she felt okay. But several days later, 5 days later Sunday (31Jan2021), on Sunday morning she felt okay, what happened was she leaned a little bit, she bent down to wash her hands in the sink and she had a huge nose bleed, it was nothing like she ever had before, she was just wiping, spurting a lot of blood so this was 5 days. It was the morning of the 5th day and they had to call an ambulance to take her to the hospital and then she left the hospital. The patient had lost a lot of blood in the ambulance, they said they had never seen so much blood, they could not stop it, they kept giving her towels and the same thing in the hospital, in the emergency room. The patient was just bleeding over everywhere. The patient informed that for the last several years she has been having one baby aspirin and has been taking for the last few months or two, two or four Vascepa which was a fish oil supplement that can thin the blood but she has never had anything like this and they said go to her ENT, and she went up going ENT, and first time she went she would not take out the packing. The patient informed that it was too severe for her to take out the packing and, when she went back with her following time she took some of the packing and it started to bleed again and she cauterized it in a lot of places and you know would wait and do it again. And then she end up putting some kind of bandage that was going to help the blood clotting. Now, she has been subsequently going back to her and it was still in the very end of. The patient informed that she was still passing some very small blood clots, it has not even stopped. The patient informed that she was on 19 days passed already, since she had the bleed. The patient was very concerned. The patient informed that she was supposed to get her second vaccine in 2 to 3 days, Tuesday and she thought that this was the very bad experience that she had. The patient wanted to know if the aspirin and fish oil could have contributed to this, she stopped these as of 31Jan2021. The patient was talking to her daughter and her daughter has a friend whose mother lives in the same area and had her first Pfizer vaccine and had a small nose bleed right afterwards and then when she has second vaccine, she had another, a very bad. The patient informed that her daughter and a friend of hers said that a similar reaction occurred to her mother after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she had two small nasal bleeds and right afterwards, when she took the second vaccine she had a very big one, like hers, where she had to be taken to the hospital. The patient was concerned, she has been told that the response to the 2nd vaccine was stronger than the first. The patient further informed that she had no nose bleed like this before, like her husband was a physician, that she never had anything like this before, this was very serious kind of situation to happen, and this after the very first vaccine that she had. She had a very severe nosebleed, she had to go to the hospital to stop it. She was on a baby aspirin and some fish oil as well. The patient informed that she wasn&#39;t warned that this could thin her blood, that this was enough of a dose to do anything to create this deluge of bleeding.  The patient informed that she was few days out from getting her second shot and she had stopped the baby aspirin and the fish oil about three weeks ago. The patient informed that she was not going to take second. The patient wanted to know how long she was going to wait, how long she was going to test her antibody and see that she don&#39;t have any more antibodies and will go take the other brand vaccine. The patient added she was reporting that she had a terrible nosebleed and wanted to file a safety report. The patient wanted to know that if she choose not to get the 2nd vaccine, because of her worry of having this reaction again, how long would it be before she could get another vaccine; how long can she wait to get the second dose, or can she get a second dose from another manufacturer. The patient was requested to contact physician. The action taken in response to the events for eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (VASCEPA) and acetylsalicylic acid was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and plausible temporal association, the causality between the BNT162B2 and the event nosebleed cannot be excluded.  This impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of  the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021191054 same reporter, similar drug/events, different patient

A 79-year-old Female patient (also the age at vaccination) received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation (AFib) and back surgery (reported as: I am recovering from very serious back surgery) both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included methotrexate (reported as , it&#39;s a little cancer pill (Further clarification was unknown if consumer have cancer, hence cancer was not captured in medical condition), once a week), tocilizumab (ACTEMRA) (reported as I am on IV Infusions every 4 weeks and the name of it is Actemra), apixaban (ELIQUIS) (reported as I am on Eliquis because I am AFib, heart), and then another heart medicine plus all the patient&#39;s &#39;vitamins&#39; (unspecified). The patient previously took oxycodone and experienced allergy (reported as I can&#39;t take any of those drugs, I am allergic to all that stuff. Yeah I can&#39;t take any of that pain medicine (Unspecified Medications)). The patient stated that: &#34;I was calling about the, I had my first shot for the virus and on my chest, starting about middle of my chest up to my neck it started to get little bit bubbles on it and now it&#39;s just burning like crazy and it&#39;s starting around my ankles. Does that have anything to do with that shot?&#34; The reporter confirmed that the next shot is due on 22Feb2021. The patient added that, &#34;Actually last week they were really light, and they just keep getting worst. I was actually going to call my doctor tomorrow because I was concerned about getting this injection anyways because of my history on having reactions to medicine. I can&#39;t take any like Oxycodone or like any of those (also reported as &#34;I can&#39;t take any of those drugs, I am allergic to all that stuff. Yeah I can&#39;t take any of that pain medicine (Unspecified Medications). No, I don&#39;t have anything like that.&#34;). I can&#39;t take any of those drugs (Unspecified Medications). And she said she thought it would be alright but I am recovering from very serious back surgery and so I have had a hard time with that. So, I thought I should call and see if I should get my second injection or if I should just let it go.&#34; It was also reported that:  &#34;Yes, it&#39;s like my chest is burned.&#34; Consumer stated for the treatment, &#34;The only thing I put on was Benadryl cream. To keep it from &#39;itching&#39;.&#34; The patient asked &#34;Should I get the second injection?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 18Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

Reporter (Nurse) stated &#34;I had my first Pfizer vaccine on Friday, I think 22Jan2021 and the only thing I have was the sore arm and got really tired okay and the sore arm went away, it descended in about 12 hours and gracely went away, after that it started itching, okay no problem.  I had my second vaccine this past Friday at about 8 O&#39;clock between 8:15 in the morning. As the day went on I felt my arm is a little bit sore, no problem. Okay I went to bed and about 3 O&#39;clock in the morning, I woke up and I was shivering, I was so cold and I ached all over and I said okay I am getting the flu, went back to sleep, by the time I got up in the morning about 6 o&#39;clock the aching was gone but I could not walk, it was like I was drunk. I have a little dog and she was barking to go out and it was like 0 here so I sat there for a minute and I left her out and she started barking, to bring her back and I could not walk, I kept walking into the walls and my house was just this dark, I thought it&#39;s so dark in my house so I got my little dog back in, sat down and again and I thought what, maybe I will take my blood pressure, so I did and it was 66 over 48 so I though okay, so I started drinking, I thought I got to eat, I got to drink, so I get that, my pressure came up to 80 over 62 or something, my pulse rate was like 116, my O2 stat was like 98 percent so that was not a problem. So, I ate and drink, as the day went on the pressure came up to like about 103, gradually last night by the time I went to bed, the only thing I had was a little bit of headache, I did not thought enough to take anything for, when I went to bed, my pressure was like 120, the systolic was 120 and diastolic was like 70 something, this morning when I got up my pressure was in the 90&#39;s. I was not taking any blood pressure medication, I mean I have but doctor took me off long time ago, I did not I mean I have no aches, I have no pains, I have nothing just a little bit of headache, not even enough to bother me, every now and then I think about it, I also, I mean I thought I have got to the bathroom, I had diarrhea terribly, something, I did not know if any of this is from the vaccine. I have not called my primary, I thought I called him tomorrow I mean I am fine, I am little short of breath when I walk up to the stairs but that is nothing unusual.&#34; Causality: Reporter stated &#34;I don&#39;t know, I am thinking it does I never had anything like this before but you know I don&#39;t know, I don&#39; know, I am just reporting it, I am 79 so I don&#39;t know how much this is, I don&#39;t know.&#34; When probed from where reporter got the vaccine, Reporter stated &#34;I got it the first one at (Institute name).&#34; LOT# of COVID-19 Vaccine administered on 22Jan2021: Reporter stated &#34;You know it&#39;s not on my little card, just the LOT# of second one is on here.

A 79-year-old non-pregnant female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP6955) at the age of 79-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Mar2021 at 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to penicillin, arthritis, and episodic atrial fibrillation (AFib) in which she had 3 episodes in the last two years. The patient has no COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS), diltiazem, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), and bifidobacterium lactis (PROBIOTIC). The patient has no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200) at the age of 79-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Feb2021 at 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility the vaccine was administered was public health clinic/veterans administration facility. The patient went into AFib on 19Mar2021 at 23:45, 12 hours after receiving the dose (as reported). She was told to drink plenty of liquids following the shot, which she did because she was so thirsty. The patient was in AFib for about 18 hours until it resolved into sinus rhythm. She wondered if there was any association with the vaccine and heart rhythm. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event &#34;went into A Fib&#34;. She was not tested with COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the event &#34;went into A Fib&#34; was recovered on 20Mar2021 at 17:45 and unknown for the other event.

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Feb2021 at age of 79-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization; methylprednisolone (MEDROL, Tablet), orally from 20Feb2021  to 26Feb2021, at 4 mg, by mouth, frequency was different based on the day, from 27Feb2021  to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for swelling, the back. Medical history included thyroid and pericarditis fluid. Family history included brother had heart disease. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) ongoing for thyroid for 20 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 in left shoulder on 21Jan2021 (Batch/lot number: EN6201) for COVID-19 immunization with no side effects.  The patient had her 2nd Pfizer vaccine dose on 11Feb2021 and received a &#34;medrol pack&#34; on 20Feb2021 for &#34;shoulder, back and neck pain. She have felt lousy for 4 weeks. She went to the hospital with palpitations and it probably was from the 2nd pack of methylprednisolone, she was prescribed after the 1st pack did not really help her pain. She haven&#39;t been sick or had a cold for 25 years and the 2nd dose through her for a loop. She stated her daughter called her and she said that her doctor told her that her vaccine may not be effective and she may not be protected because she took methylprednisolone. The patient received the second vaccine on 11Feb2021 and she had a lot of shoulder, under arm, and left breast swelling. The patient mentioned she went to her doctor because after calling the COVID hotline they said they had cases where some of the vaccine had seeped into the lymph nodes. She was told to have her lymph nodes. No patient demographic details provided regarding those other patients who had the vaccine seep into lymph nodes. She went on to explain she went to the doctor, but the doctor said there were no problems with the lymph nodes. On 13Feb2021, she felt achy and fatigued, back discomfort. The lightheadedness occurred on 18Feb2021. The doctor gave her a high dose of the methylprednisolone 4mg pack for a week. 16 days later on 27Feb2021 it had not touched the discomfort in back, fatigue and lightheadedness and gave her another pack of methylprednisolone.  She also had heart palpitation, was sweaty and went to the Emergency Room. The patient mentioned she took a low dose of levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). She asked the doctor about the methylprednisolone being taken after the shot. The patient heard it diminished the effect of the shot, that she may not have as much protection. She had called the COVID hotline to address this issue and they said people who were on chronic steroid therapy had no problem as far as they know. The patient asked if she was protected because she had the methylprednisolone pack the first one within 9 days after shot and a second pack 16 days later. She took a low dose of generic levothyroxine sodium every day. She commented she was concerned with the drug interaction and wanted to make sure still protected. She was informed by individual who answered COVID hotline she felt like she was still protected because others have been on chronic steroid therapy. Shoulder swelling started a couple day after the second shot, explained it was there or about around 13Feb2021. Her shoulder blade was puffy and tender. The swelling went into the arm and breast. Her breast felt like it weighed 60 pounds and ached. That took a while to go away. The patient explained initially it was also there or about around 13Feb2021 when she noticed she was so fatigue and had the worse headache (Feb2021), she never got nauseous. Her shoulder was still swollen a week ago as of 09Apr2021. She went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and the chiropractor said shoulder was still a little swollen. She had terrible back pain in center of back on 18Feb2021. It was so much that she was afraid something else was going on. The patient stated the swelling it was ongoing up until a few days ago as of 09Apr2021. She still had puffiness around that area when went to chiropractor. For the back discomfort she went to chiropractor for adjustment. She was unsure when that discomfort went away. The achy feeling was ongoing with her muscles and legs until last week as of 09Apr2021 when she started to feel better. Her legs felt rubbery. Her muscles felt achy. She felt better as of 09Apr2021. It had gotten better within the last week as of 09Apr2021. The fatigue was ongoing until last week as of 09Apr2021. The patient felt so bad for month and had no idea what was going on. Her lightheadedness went away last week as of 09Apr2021. She commented she did not want to blame all of this on the shot because she did not know what methylprednisolone did to her. The patient confirmed she had back discomfort. She still had some back discomfort. She started to fell short winded a week before the heart palpitations appeared really bad on 21Mar2021. She did not feel short winded anymore, but she was unsure when that stopped. With her heart palpitation she felt clammy and hot. Therefore, she wen to the ER. The heart palpitations gradually got better, and probably stopped totally last week as of 09Apr2021. She mentioned she had a headache for a good month after the second shot. It started either the 13Feb2021 or 14Feb2021. She stated all her symptoms were getting much better since last week as of 09Apr2021. There was no other treatment beside the methylprednisolone for her symptoms. Therapy start and stop date of methylprednisolone captured as confirmed by reporter in formal field, unable to clarify further. The patient confirmed all had been discarded and no lot/exp/NDC to provide. When she was in Emergency room, they did two EKG, drew blood work for the heart, chest x-ray back and front, and verified vital signs which were all good. She went home that same night on 21Mar2021. She went back to doctor on 05Apr2021 and did another chest x-ray and another echocardiogram and everything was fine. The event heart palpitation required a visit to emergency room, the patient was not sure if from the vaccine or methylprednisolone. The patient&#39;s heart rate got to 120, her normal was 80. The relevant Tests on 21Mar2021 they did Chest x-ray back and front, a couple EKG and blood work. The patient went back about a week ago as of 09Apr2021 because she was still not feeling great.

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 on 06Mar2021 13:00 (lot number: EN6205), dose 2 on 27Mar2021 13:00 (Lot Number: ER8730), both via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm at the age of 79 years old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included environmental allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication received prior vaccinations within 4 weeks included allergy shots. Vaccine was not Administered at Military Facility. No History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Caller had a side effect from the Pfizer COVID shot. Her cardiologist suggested she call. She had the first shot 06Mar2021, and two days later on 08Apr2021, her heart started quivering/ shaking only at night. It would wake her up, or would wake her up in the morning when it was time to get up. It never happened during the day. The doctor said it could have just been because she was busy during the day, and didn&#39;t notice it.  She only noticed it at night. This went on for 2 weeks. After the first week, it was still doing it so she went to her cardiologist. The doctor gave her a heart monitor (Mar2021). She wore the heart monitor for 2 weeks. She just got it off a week this Tuesday, but didn&#39;t have results yet. She got the second vaccine. The heart issue got better. It was doing it anymore before the second one. Her heart would pound sometimes too (Mar2021), but not for a long time. It would be less than a minute, and it wouldn&#39;t happen every time she had the heart shaking. She could hear it. The jiggling/fluttering/shaking got better before she went for her second shot (Mar2021). She got the second shot on 27Mar2021, and it started up again two days later. For three days now she hasn&#39;t been awakened by it. Her heart hasn&#39;t been pounding. Her doctor thought she should let Pfizer know. She had never felt better now. She would take her heart rate and blood pressure after each episode, and her blood pressure nor her heart rate ever went up (Mar2021). She never felt bad the whole time.  It was just alarming to her when it would happen. She didn&#39;t know if it was gone for sure, but it had improved. She noticed it on a Monday the 08Mar2021 two days after the vaccine she got on 06Mar2021. She noticed it both times two days later. The events did not require a visit Emergency Room, but required Physician Office, didn&#39;t go first week was doing it regularly went to cardiologist made appt and went. The outcome of the event Heart pounding was recovered on an unspecified date, of the other events was recovering.

                                                Hypertension; Tachycardia; Extreme flushing to face and neck; glowing red; took her pulse and it was 145; Persistent head to toe macular erythematous Rash; Dull Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient).  A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered on the left arm on 21Apr2021 13:12 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia (diagnosed more than 20 years ago), bladder cancer (diagnosed 13 years ago the first time, 8 reoccurrences and has been cancer free for 2 years, cancer free for 2 years), multi drug allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, diabetes, and obesity. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, levothyroxine, and oxazepam. No vaccines received within 2 weeks. In 12 minutes after the injection on 21Apr2021, while she was still sitting in the parking lot, patient developed tachycardia on and extreme flushing to face and neck on 13:20.  They were as red as being in the sun.  She was aware of tachycardia first.  Then she looked in the mirror and was glowing red. Patient was observing in parking lot and took her pulse and it was 145. Persistent head to toe macular erythematous rash occurred next.  They took her to the ER about 20 minutes after the injection. In the ER, she was given 25mg of Benadryl IV and 125 mg of Solumedrol IV.  When both of those wore off the next day, the generalized rash came back on Thursday (22Apr2021).  The rash was persistent but not as flushed looking as before. When they got her into ER, the first blood pressure reading was 198/117, which was within 20 minutes of injection. Hypertension was experienced on 13:30. Her blood pressure usually was fairly low and was back to normal now. She had one reading of 124/76 to 170/something. Her normal range is anywhere between 150-170/70-80&#39;s. She is on Lisinopril. The other morning when it was 124/76, was just a fluke. That was an unusually good reading. They did a regular panel of lab work when she went to the ER. They did not tell her that anything was abnormal.  She asked them to run an A1C, but they told her they could not. They did a chest film, EKG, placed IV to give medications, but no fluids given. Her doctor said not to get second dose of the vaccine.  She had it at the hospital and they had reports of other people with a rash. The patient considered the events tachycardia, extreme flushing, macular erythematous rash and hypertension were medically significant while for headache was non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were possibly causally related to the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to plausible temporal relationship.  This case will be reassessed should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At that time her temperature was 97.3. She felt fine the rest the day.   At 1 AM she woke up with shakes. She continued with nausea and that resulted in vomiting and then diarrhea. She also had severe pain in her thighs. This was severe enough that she called the ambulance.   Patient also relates later that she had had some burning on urination 2 days prior to the vaccination. She had leftover Macrodantin that she took 9 PM yesterday.   Also relates back in December she was seen by Dr for vaginal infection and 2 times a week she has to administer intravaginal antibiotics.   She has had multiple GI bleeds secondary to esophageal varices and is followed regularly by Dr who has had to do multiple banding procedures on her.   She also relates she has an enlarged spleen and is followed by Dr.   In the emergency room she was noted to be febrile and hypotensive. She received a total of 5 L of normal saline in the ER to bring her pressures up with a systolic below 100. She has a very elevated procalcitonin as well as lactic acid. Urine is positive for large amount of blood and small leukocyte esterase  Hospital Course 79 y.o. year old female with HTN, infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast stage I status post lumpectomy with positive margins was on anastrozole but taken off secondary to abnormal liver enzyme testing, CLL/thrombocytopenia stage I with no treatment needed, fatty liver complicated by portal hypertension/splenomegaly resulting in bleeding esophageal varices, history of viral cardiomyopathy in 2006, B12 deficiency, history of admission for septic shock, chronic diarhea, presented to the emergency room on 2/14 complaining of fevers, myalgias fatigue nausea and vomiting 24 hours after having a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. She was admitted for septic work-up and later found to be hypotensive after 7L of fluids and was transferred to the ICU for septic shock, left IJ was placed. Source of infection found to be septic from UTI. Urine culture sterile with less than 1000 colony forming units and blood cultures no growth to date.  On the day of discharge. Shock resolved. Her procalcitonin trended down. Wonder whether she had an exaggerated response to the Covid vaccine given that today the urine culture shows no growth.   Regarding acute on chronic diarrhea she had unremarkable GI PCR and diarrhea improved after starting Imodium. She is had extensive work-up for this with GI as outpatient and days colonoscopy planned in the near future.      CLL with splenomegaly/nodular hyperplasia of the liver with noncirrhotic portal hypertension/neutropenia/thrombocytopenia/hyperbilirubinemia/esophageal varices requiring banding in the past -Was restarted on propanolol and midodrine prior to discharge.  -Chronic stable anemia/B12 deficiency-getting supplementation every 3 months   Thrombocytopenia -she did have drop in platelet counts during admission while being on pantoprazole and Lovenox and these were discontinued and platelet count stabilized. She can have repeat CBC as outpatient to document improvement in platelet count. She was not noted to have any platelet type bleeding.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2(BNT162B2 PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age of 79-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that, after the first dose of the vaccine she had side effects that included red blood bleeding during the 3-4 days that she had gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, chills, and headache. The patient stated, the bleeding stopped, and she was doing better now but she was just upset and concerned with the bleeding. She did not know if she should receive the second dose. She would like to know should she receive the second dose after having this side effect. The Pfizer team responded as the patient should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if patient had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. The Pfizer team referred patient to speak to her healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. The outcome of the events red blood bleeding was recovering, and the outcome of the events gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, chills, and headache was unknown.

Per patient, she was gardening last week and developed chest pressure/SOB when moving around some mulch this lasted on and off for 3 days and then was followed by intense fatigue which persisted today so she came into ED. She was placed in observation for chest pain, and to rule out ischemia. Upon admission, a COVID-19 test was run for screening, and was positive. Other than fatigue and chest pain, she was not endorsing other symptoms and did not have hypoxia or coughing at all.  Although on admit, there was plan to get a stress test, given the COVID-19 diagnosis, this was deferred. She was discharged to home in stable condition on 5/5.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207), intramuscular, administered in the right arm on 16Mar2021 15:00 (at the age of 79 years old) as second dose at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Essential thrombocythaemia from 2013 and ongoing, ongoing Acid reflux (esophageal) which was diagnosed at least 10 years ago. No other vaccinations was given within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. Concomitant medications included hydroxycarbamide (HYDREA) for Essential thrombocythaemia from 2013 and ongoing; ongoing omeprazole (PROTONIX) for Acid reflux (esophageal). The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EN6200) intramuscular in the right arm on 23Feb2021 (at the age of 79 years old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced extreme heart palpitations on 16May2021 23:00. The patient reported that she wanted to call and report an adverse event with the COVID-19 vaccine. When she used the website, it was not working correctly. When she get 95 percent done, it would not accept. She would hit submit and it would not do anything and the email would show up in red. She said that it was the second vaccine. She experienced extreme heart palpitations. She had the vaccine at 3pm and the heart palpitations started that night around 11 and continued for hours. She almost went to the ER. She said that it continued for a good week and into the second week. In the meantime, she had a surgery. She noticed the heart palpitations a little bit then. She said that she is still having it now. She is on medication for it now to try and take care of it and it has only been 3 days though. No further details provided about the surgery. She never had any heart palpitations. She stated that the heart palpitations have subsided and when she has them they are pounding palpitations, but they do not last as long. This was the only thing that happened to her. It was all after the second vaccine. She had no other side effects. Treatment was metoprolol tartrate 25 mg 1/2, twice daily and it has not helped so far. The event required a visit to phyisician office for which they gave her a halter monitor about a month ago on 10May2021. The outcome of the event was recovering.

About a 3 months later (June) I started having problems with my heart but it wasn&#39;t directly after I had my vaccine. . I did see a Doctor about my heart and they put my on a heart monitor and I haven&#39;t gotten any results from it yet. I did have a-fib one night. I have appointment with cardio tomorrow 06/25/2021. I thought it was odd because I never had a-fib before and now all of a sudden I do.

A 79-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 30Jan2021(at the age of 79-years-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL1283) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) If applicable, list any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine(s) was none. Family medical history relevant to AE(s) was none and she is getting close to obesity if she keeps eating like this. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 11Jan2021, (Lot Number: EK9231, Expiry Date: Unknown, this is not on the CDC vaccine record card) via Injection administered in Arm Left for covid-19 immunisation and experienced Left arm was real sore after first dose injection. The historical vaccine included shingles vaccine. The patient experienced blood pressure/ up to 210/110 mmHg on 20Feb2021 felt chills/chills on 31Jan2021, felt yucky on 31Jan2021, not walking well on 20Feb2021 , felt sick/sick as a dog on 20Feb2021, feeling nauseous on 20Feb2021, threw up like crazy on 20Feb2021, funny feeling around her head/feeling really funny on 20Feb2021, face usually gets red when her blood pressure is high and it she is not red at this time on 20Feb2021, vertigo on 20Feb2021, felt the really funny feeling going up her throat on an unspecified date in 2021, her heart rate has been wanting to be a little higher than usual on an unspecified date in 2021 and her balance was not quite right on an unspecified date in 2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 220/110 mmHg (normal value: 120/80) on 20Feb2021, computerised tomogram: doctor mentioned 3 little places on 20Feb2021, electrocardiogram: unknown results on 20Feb2021, heart rate: little higher than usual on an unspecified date in 2021, laboratory test: unknown results on 20Feb2021. Patient received both dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 11Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. On the next day after the 2nd dose, she felt chills. On 20Feb2021, she started not walking well, thought she would fall. All of a sudden, she felt sick and threw up like crazy while she was visiting her daughter for the day. The firefighters came to take her blood pressure and it was up to 210/110 mmHg. They advised her to go to the ER. After several hours, she was given blood pressure and nausea pills. They mentioned vertigo. She says it got okay. However, 2 weeks ago, she started to have a funny feeling around her head. Not dizzy but her face usually gets red when her blood pressure high and she was not red at that time. It was again reported that the day after she was administered the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had chills and felt yucky that day. She also reported feeling really funny since 20Feb2021. She was asked for further information on events related to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. She was at her daughter and noticed her balance was not quite right. She started feeling really funny so just lay down there for a little bit. When she did get up after about 15 minutes she started feeling nauseous. She got to the bathroom really fast and threw up like crazy. She did not have her blood pressure cuff with her so her daughter called the fire department and took her down there real fast. At the fire station they took her blood pressure which was 210/110 mmHg, so they suggested she head to the emergency room so she did. She was under observation in the emergency room, but not admitted to the hospital. The doctor mentioned vertigo somewhere along the way before she left the emergency room. She just kind of brushed the vertigo off until she was reading about that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine can cause vertigo. She guesses vertigo was what caused these events because she had been sick as a dog. When they got her on the bed and rolled her back she felt like she was going 90 miles per hour and by the time they got her back on the bed she was throwing up again-but this time and the initial onset of throwing up was the only times she threw up. They gave her something after probably 5-6 hours, blood pressure medicine and nausea medicine and she got ok and left there. Her heart rate has been wanting to be a little higher than usual. About 2 weeks ago she was just sitting on the couch and noticed especially when she would turn her head she still feels really funny; not dizzy, dizzy; she was walking ok; but the really funny feeling keeps hitting her continuously. During call when she sat back down she felt the really funny feeling going up her throat. It was just the weirdest thing, she wishes she had a word to really explain what the really funny feeling was but she does not. She has not checked her blood pressure for a while because she has been holding for a while for this department, so her blood pressure could be up a little bit, but she stated event was worse right now than it has been. Regarding testing/investigations while in the emergency room they did a CT head scan, lab tests, and an EKG. CT head scan results, the doctor mentioned 3 little places but when she talked to her doctor he said that was really just nothing to worry about with age; he said they will check it in 6 months and make sure areas are not growing. Caller has no further information to provide regarding lab tests or EKG results, they did not mention anything. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of blood pressure/ up to 210/110 mmHg and feeling nauseous. The outcome of the events, felt chills/Chills , Felt yucky, her balance was not quite right, felt sick/sick as a dog, threw up like crazy, face usually gets red when her blood pressure is high and it she is not red at this time, felt the really funny feeling going up her throat, Her heart rate has been wanting to be a little higher than usual was reported as unknown, not walking well, feeling nauseous and vertigo was reported as recovering, funny feeling around her head/Feeling really funny and blood pressure/ up to 210/110 mmHg was reported as not resolved.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On February 18, 2021, three days after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, patient was rushed to the emergency room with rapidly dropping blood pressure and difficulty keeping conscious.   After being in COVID isolation for 24 hours, I saw her in a hospital bed and she looked like a corpse.   The initial diagnosis was severe Sepsis with liver, kidney and heart problems and blood clots in both lungs.  She had never had any of this before getting the Pfizer vaccine.  Her WBC count was also very high.   She was hospitalized for 10 days and then sent to a rehab facility for 14 days before returning to her independent living facility.   She is now taking blood thinners for the blood clots which she didn&#39;t have prior to taking the vaccine.  He did a miracle in sparing her life!

Within less than 20 minutes BP measured at 203/185  and 15 minutes later 191/187.   (normal for me is 128/65).   Heart rate 130   (normal is 92)   Lightheadedness.    EMTs on site did EKG and subsequent BP checks.      Recommended Emergency Room care, which I did.    Aspirin given, blood work done (at 3 different times).   2 Additional EKGs done with no abnormalities noted..   BP and heart rate went down  in approximately 2 hours,  to 138/85 and 105, but not to normal status.          Have been normalized since.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

I did not feel good on Sunday, so I ate very little that day and my sugar was about 42 points higher than normal.  On  Monday, I had the same breakfast and lunch that I normally have -- no changes in routine and  my sugar had jumped 60 points when checked just prior to dinner.  Today it is still abnormally high (30 points higher), even when  checked first thing in the morning. Since my sugar is pretty stable, if I watch what I eat this is extremly unusual. and occurred after the second vaccine shot. I believe the sugar readings are decreasing steadily and will see how they are today and tomorrow.

                                                On the second day after i received the first dose of the Covid vaccine I started having tightness in my chest with a cough. On a scale of 1-10 the symtoms were 7-8 I also developed a rash on my arms as if I had been burned.  I had to use  an inhaler that I already  had and I ussed Hydocortisone cream on the rash  I saw the Nurse Practicioner on 2/10 2021 and was given Medrol 4mg tabs Today I am still coughing with slight tightness in my chest and the ras is resolving but scars linger.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

The patient developed heart flutter at night on 3/4/21, which she thought was a heart attack.  She called EMS and they checked her out and all her vitals were normal.  She saw her MD on 3/5/21 who said it was not a heart attack and she was fine.  He did not think the symptoms were related to the vaccination and he thought the heart flutter was stress related.   The heart flutter went away on it&#39;s own.   She also developed a red rash all over her body the evening of 3/5/21 that is still present.  She has been treating that with Vaseline intensive care and Aloe.  Her skin is very dry and crepey

                                                On the 5th day after receiving the vaccine I became dizzy.  The next morning I became very dizzy and went to the hospital.  They admitted me to Emergency because my blood pressure was extremely high-they said later it was about 187/ ?.  While I was there the blood pressure went up over 200 to 214/81.  I was dizzy and nausious and shaking because I became very cold even though the nurse covered me with 3 blankets.  After I left the hospital it took until after I got a prescription for meclizine filled and took one at 7PM before I was able to get the blood pressure down to a normal range - 130/64.  Today I am still taking meclizine as prescribed and am still slightly dizzy.  I do not know if this was related to the vaccine or not.

                                                choking experience; throat tickled; dizziness; bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction; bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction; Her heart started to pound/a rapid heartbeat; her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears); had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover; high adrenal stimulance; excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does; high pressure; dehydrated; couldn&#39;t sleep; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

A 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscularly on  07Jan2021 at 12:00 (at the age of 80-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ovarian and endometrial cancer. Concomitant medications were not provided. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks of immunization. On 07Jan2021,  the patient received the first Pfizer shot. When she went for the second shot, she was waiting outside in the heat (she is a cancer victim) and she passed out so they wouldn&#39;t give her the second shot. She mentioned that, then, she couldn&#39;t go back because of cancer treatments she was being given and the facility was only open in that community for a certain amount of time.  She finally went for a second shot at a different facility (&#34;Institute&#34;) but she was told that she couldn&#39;t get the shot because &#34;they didn&#39;t know if the first shot was real&#34; as they had a different lot number than the Pfizer lot number that she had. She explained further that her first COVID 19 vaccination lot number is recorded on her vaccination card as &#34;RL3246.&#34; Her husband&#39;s COVID 19 vaccination card says &#34;EL3246&#34; for lot number and they received injections on the same day. The caller believes her lot number should also say &#34;EL3246&#34; -  she thinks it&#39;s a small written &#39;e.&#39;  The patient added that, as of the reporting date,  &#34;It is 50 days since I had the last shot.&#34; She also asked if she has to retake the vaccines or if she can just take the second dose. The clinical outcomes of the event &#34;passed out&#34; was not provided.

Her platelets run low usually between 81-100. On her CBC taken 2/18/21, her platelets were 51. On 3/2 they were 47 and on 3/8 they were 34.  The first part of March a change in gate was noted in patient, sh fell on 3/8/21 and hit her head. On 3/8 a CT scan detected bilateral subdural hematoma. Certain internal bleeding was believed to be caused by the fall, other bleeding appeared to be present prior to the fall.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN9809; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetic, asthma, allergy, sugar, and thyroid (disorder). The patient also stated that she has a lot of allergies.

She was a day and half in the hospital, trying to get her blood pressure down which went down somehow that she still have over 200 blood pressure. When paraphrased the above concern she stated, &#34;Yeah absolutely want to know what kind of result or what kind of the side effect you are going to have.&#34; The patient also stated at the time of report, &#34;I still have my blood pressure is still 200 and my sugar is very high too (unspecified date in Mar2021), is that part of the after effect of the vaccine because I didn&#39;t have that before.&#34; The patient was hospitalized from 02Mar2021 to 04Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of blood pressure went from normal to 190 (hypertension) and couldn&#39;t breathe. The patient stated her doctor put her in the double medicine for the blood pressure. When probed for if patient was still experiencing issue, she stated &#34;No, as soon as I came home I took Benadryl&#34;. The patient reported that her breathing improved as soon as she took Benadryl and her chest is probably clear now. As treatment, they gave her blood pressure pills. They gave her Pravastatin 20 mg. Outcome of the event blood pressure went from normal to 190 and sugar is very high was not recovered. Outcome of couldn&#39;t breathe was recovering. Outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the known safety profile and the temporal association of BNT162B2 administration to the events, a possible contribution of the drug to the events cannot be excluded.

This was a big change since the administration of the vaccine. Also, my TSH levels were elevated -from 6.4 to 10.4-in less than two months.

Patient complained of being hungry stated she had not eaten all day around.  was given water and crackers, said she was feeling better but during further assessment she said she felt dizzy and light headed. Blood pressure right arm 160/103 hr 75. No complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath. She was talkative through out episode. Next BP was 184/91 HR 75. needed to go to the ladies room ambulated to rest room with nurse in attendance. No notable issue with gait.  The patient stated that she was feeling better but the blood pressures where elevated. Decided to ask EMT to do a manuel BP in the right  arm BP 160/82. Even though  was verbal, her responses where vague. One minute she felt fine then she was dizzy. was encouraged to call someone, but she felt she might be able to make it. There was a concern with her driving her self home.  EMT performed a cognitive test she stated the wrong year and did not know who the president was when asked in two separate assessments. They also performed a neuro assessment which was uneventful. EMT tried to contact sons but were unable too and patient could not find her phone where we could call a neighbor.  EMT suggested that she should go to the ED to be evaluated to be on the safe side and she agreed.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

                                                The morning after Mom&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer shot, Dad woke up and found Mom lying on the floor next to the bed.  Mom said, &#34;I can&#39;t move my arm.&#34; Dad called paramedics who checked her.  They said her vital signs were normal and left.  On 2/9/21 in the morning my da awoke to see that Mom had large amounts of bubbly saliva pouring from her mouth onto her pillow.  Dad called paramedics, who said this was a diabetic reaction.  Mom had NEVER had anything happen like this before.  Mom was very sleepy, could not be aroused, and made only gurgling noises.  She was admitted to the hospital for care and therapy.  She pulled her own IV out.  Mom had to be restrained in the hospital and sedated, due to confusion and worsening dementia.  By 2/18 when we spoke by phone mom&#39;s speech was abnormally slow and very repetitive.  &#34;I&#39;m very tired today&#34; was spoken many times.  In morning time mom was able to follow basic conversation.  Not so later in the day.  Mom came home from rehab on 2/26/21.  She was able to walk steadily and independently at home after her therapy.  After a week or so, Mom began hitting the in-home caregiver.  Dad&#39;s presence would calm her.  In a short time Mom seemed not to know dad anymore, and would hit him and the caregiver when they helped her.  She also pulled all covers off the bed and pulled clothes out of the closet, throwing them all over the room during the night.  Mom was usually walking around the house during each night.  On 4/16/21 Mom and dad were napping sitting up on the couch in the morning.  Mom fell forward and hit her head on the hearth.  Dad and caregiver gave first aid and called paramedics, who took her to the ER.  Mom came home on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 Mom pulled her catheter out in the early morning.  In the afternoon Mom&#39;s appearance was concerning, so Dad called paramedics.  They said that Mom&#39;s BP had dropped very low and took her to the ER. Mom was combative the next day in the hospital.  Dr. adjusted her medications periodically to ensure that mom&#39;s care would be manageable when she would eventually be sent home.  Minimal therapy was done due to dementia.  By 5/3/21 doctor said that Mom is bed bound and needing total care.  Her blood sugar spiked high despite special diet.  Staff waiting for insulin order from doctor.  5/4/21 Doctor called Dad to say that Mom had died during the night.

An 80-year-old (currently she just turned 81-year-old) female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 03Feb2021 3:20 PM (Batch/Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose at the age of 80-year-old for covid-19 immunisation, as care provider for her husband, administered at a COVID vaccine clinic setup.  Medical history, family medical history and concomitant medications were none. She has been very healthy. Before BNT162B2 first dose, In Jan2021, 2 weeks prior BNT162B2, she got the second dose of shingles shot (VARICELLA VACCINE) for immunization with no adverse effect. No adverse effect  occurred following prior vaccinations. No other history of all previous immunization with BNT162B2. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. In Feb2021 she experienced pain all over body with outcome of recovered, chest pain with outcome of recovered, leg pain with outcome of recovered, severe pain on her neck.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included in 2021: haemoglobin: low, platelet count: 760   higher than normal at 760, red blood cell count: low , weight: 120lbs. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The course of events was as follows: After she got the first dose she had some adverse reactions in 2021: she had pain all over body, chest pain, leg pain, severe pain on her neck, that she couldn&#39;t lift her head. She has seen some specialists to seek assistance, she has seen a hematologist, and a rheumatologist. She has been on steroids and she was not yet done with the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Her doctor was very aware. When this started 3 months before, she 110 lbs but she has been taking steroids and her weight has shot up like crazy now she is 120 lbs, she told her doctor that she had no more fat clothes she will have to get off of the steroids, they blame everything on steroids. She said nothing else is relevant she was fine, in fact she was dancing the weekend before, that Saturday night she went to a Portuguese evening and was learning to do their dances and Monday morning she couldn&#39;t get out of bed. She refused to go to Emergency Room for the events.

They gave her massive doses of steroids she was taking 15 mg of steroids and right now they are lowering it. She had not the pain now but it was worse than childbirth. She has recovered completely from the pain, she felt fine now she has to wait until they take the steroids away again. She stated a lot of the blood, the red blood cell count was low, the hemoglobin was low, everything was low except for the platelets. So they told her to wait. She stated they blame everything on the steroids. Her anxiety started and her heart started racing, they said it was steroids, she was hungry they say it was steroids, she told the doctor she was gaining weight, they say it was steroids.

                                                Patient is an 80 y/o right handed female who is totally independent at baseline who received her Pfizer vaccine out of the country (1st dose 2/19/21, 2nd dose 3/12/21).  She was reactive to both shots, reporting arthralgias, headache, low grade fever, chills. She had a rise in blood pressure later during the day of her shot as well as the next day (up to 180/70, from baseline of 130/70). She also had an episode of epistaxis several days after her first shot.  She traveled independently out of the country on 3/31/21 to visit her son on a leisure trip. On 4/5/21 she had headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, and did not feel well, and her systolic BP was 198, after which she took additional 40 mg of lisinopril.   Her BP subsequently decreased to systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on 4/5/21, but over the next few days she had labile BP with a range of BP of 125 to 171/ 58 - 68.  She was meticulous in checking and recording her BP several times a day, and she increased her lisinopril dose to 40 mg po qd from 20 mg po qd given the higher than usual blood pressure range.  On 4/10/21 her BP was as follows: 6:30 am, 148/60 (she took her daily lisinopril 20 mg po); 11:30 am:  132/52; 3 pm: 171/69 (she took additional lisinopril 20 mg po) after which her systolic BP decreased to 130. Then around 6:20 pm the same day (4/10/21), she had acute onset of headache, vomiting, left sided weakness, SBP 220, and was witnessed to have rapid change in mental status. There was no antecedent trauma to the head. EMTs were called immediately and she had loss of consciousness during the ambulance ride to the ED, after about 20 minutes of symptom onset, with agonal breathing and bradycardia to the 40s, but never lost her pulse. Upon arrival to the ED out of the country, her Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, she was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Head CT demonstrated massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage (140 cc) within the R temporal parietal and occipital lobes, with cerebral edema and 14 mm midline shift, associated with small subdural hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage within the temporal horn and body of the R lateral ventricle. They reported hyperdense &#34;spot sign&#34; within the intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with active hemorrhage, no evidence of venous thrombosis, no masses, no arteriovenous malformations. She had 2.5 mm aneurysm right  that was thought to be incidental finding unrelated to her event. She was taken emergently to the OR on 4/10/2021 for decompressive R hemicraniectomy, which she underwent successfully with minimal blood loss.  She had no coagulopathy and her platelets and hemoglobin were normal. She remained in the Neuro ICU for 3 weeks. She received a tracheostomy two weeks after her presentation, and was weaned off the ventilator. She is breathing spontaneously after 5 weeks from presentation. She remains in coma or minimally conscious state, with GCS score of 5-6 as of 5/13/2021.

                                                Bleeding/felt blood on her arm /blood was coming from the top of the band aid; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for self. This 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EL3248) via unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 02:00 PM at right arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, clopidogrel (manufacturer: Aurobindo, lot# QR7520022-A, expiry date: Apr2022) oral from Dec2020 at 75 mg once a day for TIA (Transient ischaemic attack). Medical history included TIA from Aug2019. She had her first TIA Aug2019, and then had her second a couple months ago, it was not as severe, the buildings moved and she walked like she was drunk, but had only one other thing than walking funny and buildings moving, she can&#39;t remember what that was. Pain, blood cholesterol abnormal.  Pain in both of her arms, she said her left arm hurt more than her right arm from time to time, and when the left started hurting she took all the pills, but she didn&#39;t take Hydrocodone though it is prescribed, she didn&#39;t take that unless she was in a lot more pain than usual. She said her doctors said different things about her arm pain, one said she had a torn rotator cuff, another said arthritis, someone else said it was something in her neck but it was a big word that she didn&#39;t know, she just knew she had pain. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN, manufacturer: Bayer, UPC number: 349483 48150) from Aug2019 for TIA; carbamazepine from Jan2021 for pain in both of her arms; metoprolol succinate, had been taking it a couple years; zolpidem; hydrocodone for pain (she only takes if she is dying of pain, clarified to being in a lot of pain); atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient reported that she had COVID-19 and experienced side effect. She said it happened after the 15 minutes observation when she left to drive home on 14Jan2021. She said 5 minutes into her drive she felt blood on her arm and put her hand in her shirt, and wiped it, saw blood. She said the bleeding was weird so she pulled over to look at her arm, and blood was coming from the top of the band aid where normally it would seep down from the bottom. She used five baby wipe, and wiped a lot of blood, until finally she thought it stopped bleeding. She was not light headed or in pain, it was a 45 minute drive and she got home and was still bleeding so she took her shirt off and put a towel around it to stop the bleeding and it finally stopped. She said she didn&#39;t think to report it until her doctor said to when she told him, he had said maybe the girl who gave her the shot hit a vein, but she should tell them. She said maybe she did hit a vein, because she had never had problems when getting a shot or more than a spot of blood in the past. She said one thing that may be important was that she had a couple of TIAs, many series (unable to clarify) her doctor friend assessed that with three MRIs and MRAs. She said she just refilled one of her medications, Clopidogrel, and was reading the instructions for it and it says it can cause excessive bleeding. She said that she was not bleeding so she didn&#39;t worry about it, that maybe that caused excessive bleeding.  She had not had a second dose, but she didn&#39;t want to go through this again with the bleeding, though if it was just a vein or air that may not happen. She said she was very healthy, no underlying conditions at all, never had a problem before, her arm was not painful, she was not light headed. She said the baby wipe she had on her arm after the car ride was full of blood, and she still couldn&#39;t get the band aid off, so she wrapped her arm towel kept sopping up blood until finally it quit. She put another band aid over the bloody band aid, and it quit and she was fine. She had no injection site pain, no tiredness, no headache. Lab data included she had MRIs and MRAs, but there was no bleeding. The action taken for clopidogrel was unknown. The outcome of event was recovered.

The patient was found not to be diabetic and was given some crackers, juice and water. She was offered to go to a private room for further monitoring, but declined. Her condition did not improve, so she was taken to a private room for monitoring and observation at about 2:30PM. Vitals were taken, she was still feeling poorly and had very high blood pressure (&gt;200 systolic). She declined the ED. At 2:40PM, her blood pressure did not decrease, so the ED was called to take her in, and she agreed.

                                                my head and ears closed down; my head and ears closed down; she doesn&#39;t sleep all night long; her body was shaking; my heart was beating out of my chest; felt a little lazy and tired; tinge-y pains in her heart; SVT; shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said &#34;my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down.&#34; The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated &#34;I am so allergic to medicine.&#34; She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was &#34;so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix.&#34; States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about &#34;2 pages long.&#34;  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to take the second dose and probably won&#39;t. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn&#39;t had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn&#39;t want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn&#39;t in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn&#39;t feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn&#39;t know about COVID but he hadn&#39;t heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn&#39;t feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn&#39;t know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn&#39;t think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200&#39;s for underactive thyroid, it&#39;s minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn&#39;t have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won&#39;t take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?  The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events heart was &#39;beating out of chest&#39;, &#39;head and ears closed down&#39; was recovered in Jan2021, of other events was unknown.

                                                COVID 19 Pfizer - 2nd dose, 2/16/2021 Lot number - EL9261 -   About 48 hours later, I got this pain breastbone. I couldn&#39;t turn over to the left or right when down because of the pain. It was not shortness of breath. It was pretty bad. This pain lasted about 3 weeks.  Soreness is my arm appeared the day of vaccination but that went away within 2 days.  I also kept sneezing non stop, and my nose was runny this also started about 48 hours after vaccination. It is better but not completely gone yet. The sneezing is not constant, as of today but still there.

Then, around 7am this morning, the palpitations started a little again, but not as bad as last night. She had breakfast and then was okay again. Then she sat down in front of her computer, and the palpitations started again. The palpitations are not constant, they come and go. On 09Feb2021, the patient experienced feeling shaky but states this might be because she is nervous about the palpitations. On 09Feb2021, she experienced soreness and swelling at the injection site.

An 81-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 81 years of age), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in arm right on 19Feb2021 17:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included PFIZER BIONTECH COVID 19 VACCINE, first dose at 81 years of age, intramuscular in the right arm on 28Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had not received other vaccines in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination nor was she tested post vaccination. She had no known allergies. The patient experienced a severe ulcerative colitis flare up starting within 24 hours of the 2nd vaccine. Initially, as a exceptionally private and stubborn person, she did not report her progressing symptoms to her family and only after she &#34;felt as if she was actively dying&#34; did she reach out for help (01Mar2021). Additional symptoms included severe burning pain across her lower abdomen, vomiting greater than 7 times, persistent diarrhea, gray skin pallor and she appeared slightly jaundiced. Patient refused repeated offers from daughters to be taken to hospital. On 01Mar2021, contact was made with her gastroenterologist and in the morning of 02Mar2021, she was restarted on her UC treatment, which was oral budesonide (unsure of dose). Outcome was improving. She was now able to intake food and liquids and her UC symptoms are resolving. She was up and active again. The events started on 20Feb2021 with outcome of recovering. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about batch/ lot number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on data provided and temporal association, the reported events are assessed as possibly related to BNT162B2.

The consumer reported the similar events for the patient with different dose. This is the second of two reports. This 81-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 26Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient received the first dos of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: EL9264) on 26Feb2021 in left arm for COVID-19 immunization and after the first dose about 8 days later, her blood pressure went up very high. Its normally never get that high. It went up to about 180, 190 even 200 over 80 and then she saw her physician was put on some blood pressure medication, and she got better. When the patient received the first dose, she have a headache and was slightly nauseous. Then the patient had her second vaccine. After that the same thing happen about a week later. her blood pressure went very high (went up to about 180, 190 even 200 over 80), and she suffered because of it with a lot of anxiety in 2021. The patient want to know something about that the blood pressure went really very high. It was still not regular; it was very irregular. When she went for the second dose, she did not even looked when the nurse was putting a needle in her arm so, she felt that the needle went in but shortly after she heard the nurse said oh jeez and she know the nurse put it right in her arm. Shortly after the nurse said old gee and kept wiping her arm. Later she noticed the nurse had a gauze under the band aid. The patient thought maybe she was bleeding, she did not have a look, she ended up with a bandage over it and that was it, other day she see it did not have any blood on it. And she wondering if she got the full dose of the second vaccine, she had absolutely no side effects immediately after over the next day. Also, she took a test for antibody and that came out negative in 2021. She was still experiencing the high blood pressure after the second vaccination as well. The physician had prescribed the medication for blood pressure went very high with losartan 75 mg. The outcome of blood pressure went very high was not recovered. It&#39;s over.

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid disorder, and bleeding. The patient stated &#34;I am bleeder. My father had hemophilia and I have the female version which I never remember what it&#39;s called but I bleed easily but I didn&#39;t bleed at all for when I had the shot, it was fine.&#34; Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). Patient stated, &#34;Yes, I took my medication that morning. I take thyroid medication, blood pressure medication. I don&#39;t remember what I take for blood pressure.&#34; The patient reported &#34;Well I am calling I felt just fine right now. I had my first shot by Pfizer on the 24th and I felt great and they watched me and I left and I was driving home and I had a dizzy spell while I was driving. I don&#39;t know if I passed out or not, I might have but if I did, it wasn&#39;t for very long, they were digging up the road I couldn&#39;t stop, couldn&#39;t park so I made it home okay and I was fine the rest of the day but then the next day, I had a lot of dizzy spells but I was at home so I didn&#39;t worry, I just sat down and I was okay and then the 3rd day I got up for breakfast and I bumped into everything, I dropped everything and then I started to get out of chair and the chair fell down and I fell down and that was just a mess. So, I went to bed and I felt at least if I fall, I fall on bed and that was the day I was dizzy but then it went away and I have been fine ever since. That began on 24th, the 24th was the first day and I did call my doctor and I have been trying to call here and I never think it through but finally today, sat to watch, hang on to the phone and what I am concerned about is getting my second vaccine. Is there anything I should watch for or tell anybody or, because my doctor said you shouldn&#39;t get dizzy but I did?&#34; The patient confirmed the vaccine as Pfizer&#39;s Covid 19 vaccine. About the lot number, the patient stated, &#34;It looks like EN, I am not sure if it&#39;s E and N 6203.&#34; The patient further reported, &#34;No, I just went home and the first day I was over with it by the time I got home and I didn&#39;t had anymore. The next day I just sat down and rested, I knew it will go away and it did and then 3rd day I went to bed and just thought I would fall and hurt myself and that&#39;s everything I did. Well I used to be 5 foot 2 and a quarter but I think I have gotten shorter, I don&#39;t know what I really am but little bit shorter than that now and my weight is 100 and lets see, I am going to say 170, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s exactly right but it&#39;s pretty close to that I think, I didn&#39;t really weighed myself lately. 5 foot 2 and a quarter that&#39;s what I was when I did last but now I shrunk and less than that but I don&#39;t remember what I am.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure was up and blood pressure was off on an unspecified date. When probed for causality reporter states, it could be related but she is not sure because she just cant understand how everything, her thyroid, her blood pressure went up, way up, and her heart. She really doesn&#39;t know, she thinks it is pretty serious, she is nervous to go out. She confirms it was requiring hospitalization, they kept her, the cardiovert was that afternoon and they kept her until next morning. The outcome of event was unknown.

She reports since her second covid short on 4/29, she&#39;s been feeling &#34;ill.&#34; she states she&#39;s been having diarrhea, chills, fatigue, and cough. In the ER, she was found to be in afib with RVR. She was given a one time dose of cardizem but then spontaneously converted to NSR. She is not hypoxic but admits to increased cough and occasional dyspnea. CTA was done in the ER due to elevated D dimer. Pulm embolism was ruled out, however, she was found to have bilateral infiltrates concerning for viral pna   Hospital Course:   Please send details from consultation note from hematology gastroenterology   81-year-old Caucasian female she had a history of COPD hypertension she was admitted through the emergency room on May 6 with a chief complaint of palpitation chest discomfort.  She was found to have A. fib with RVR with underlying history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Patient was admitted and atrial fibrillation is rate controlled in maintain with increase his Lopressor.  ACS is ruled out by cardiac enzyme patient was found to have a COVID-19 pneumonia fortunately patient oxygen saturation remained good continue having mild cough.  And initially she was not started any dexamethasone or any antiviral remdesivir.  But over the time patient actually having mild wheezing shortness of breath but oxygen saturation remained stable so then dexamethasone was started.  Heart rate was pretty controlled with current medication Lopressor anticoagulation did not start since patient was found to have a severe thrombocytopenia.  Patient was seen by hematologist recommend to bone marrow biopsy thought that the sudden drop possible from infectious source.  So then that point Heparin Olympic Eliquis was not started.  Over the time patient platelet count back to normal platelet count 1 75,000 Eliquis started 2 days ago.  Since she looked tolerating Eliquis heart rate is well controlled after adding dexamethasone she is underlying history of COPD her wheezing is much improved and she is currently on DuoNeb.  In the history of asthma without status asthmaticus patient will be discharged home with continue current medication Decadron for 5 more days started Eliquis 5 mg 2 times daily since she is tolerating and platelet count is normal I recommend to check CBC for platelet count in 5 days.  This patient will benefit to see hematologist outpatient although she refused to do a bone marrow biopsy.  She is having chronic low back pain and currently on narcotics recommend to follow-up with PCP to change his narcotic medication..  Initially she had a CTA chest done which was normal although D-dimer was mildly elevated negative for pulmonary embolism and a mild infiltration concerning viral pneumonia so bacterial antibiotic was not started.  Stable to be discharged home she was having intermittent low-grade fever for almost like 5 to 10 days.  The fever is totally gone now.  She is clinically stable new medication is adjusting increase Lopressor 50 mg 2 times daily.  Eliquis 5 mg p.o. twice daily and she is going to go home with Decadron only for 5 days..  Patient also have underlying history of chronic dysphagia patient was seen by gastroenterology recommend to follow-up outpatient in 2 to 3 weeks Follow-up PCP in 5 days, follow-up with hematology as scheduled

                                                Two days after patient&#39;s first vaccine@ about 4 pm, I could tell that something was wrong with her. Every day she and I play cards, but this day she was really struggling. She couldn&#39;t figure out where any of the cards went, and was missing every play. I tool her up to lay down. At about 6pm, her eyes looked really glassy and she was unable to speak clearly. Her words were very slurred, and her sentences did not make any sense. I called 911, and they came and took her to the ER. The doctors said that she had a small stroke. She was put on a low dosage of blood pressure medicine, and was hospitalized for 6 days to monitor her. During that time many tests were run on her.  2nd Vaccine- 2-24-21 Two hours after returning from getting the second vaccine, the patient went upstairs to go to the bathroom and she passed out onto the bathroom floor. Again, when talking to her, her words were slurred. She was very weak. I called 911 again. Initially they were not going to take her, but when she went to get up she fell back down. She was too weak to walk, so they took her to the ER again. She was released to go home that evening. Sher saw her primary doctor and was referred by her oncologist to see a hematologist. She endured a three month waiting period until she could be tested for APLS. She will go this Friday to find out the reslts of that test. Additionally, she saw her vascular neurologist, Dr. He looked at her scans and said it was NOT a stroke. He said that  her body basically had a surge as a result of trying to fight off the vaccine. He said that the CAT scan that was done at the time she went to the ER the first time did NOT indicate signs of a new stroke, but that what they were seeing on the scans was from her past stroke. Dr. said that he saw no indication that she had another stroke and that her body was just reacting to the vaccine. He said that all of the symptoms that she had were all things that could happen because of the surge.

She has bruising on both lower limbs, a bleeding disorder. She bled from her eye at the ophthalmologists office. On an unspecified date patient second one, then had bruising in the other leg. She went to the hematologist, and to the doctor. The doctor did PTT, confirmed as PTT, and it was elevated. Reported added that patient also had an elevated potassium. She states this was like what you would get if patient were taking warfarin. it was very concerning now, not only does she have bruising in the leg, but she was bleeding into the eye and that to her was just, it keeps getting worse. She has nothing else to add to that report except that her mom has an elevated PTT, TPTT and states she does not know, it was thrombo. At 81, her mom walks around an hour a day, does aerobics. She was not seeing a hematologist and she was concerned. If she cut herself, she would bleed out. The fact she was bleeding into the eyeball, she has to google the acronym but it was basically clotting issues it was resulting in. No additional details provided; Reporter did not know the name of the elevated test.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                accompanied with a panic attack; 2nd dose- went into a tachycardia event that was beyond anything she has ever had in the past 40 years; trauma; 2nd dose- extremely exhausted; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported for herself. An 81-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (fairly early in the day) (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) as 2ND DOSE,SINGLE for covid-19 immunization, at the age at vaccination of 81 years old.  Anatomical Location of Administration of Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: She did not really remember but she tends to think it was in her right arm for both. Medical history included tachycardia (This all started when she was 43 years old, and usually gets them periodically; benign with a regular rhythm), ongoing panic attack had for 40 years, ongoing anxiety (reported as she was an anxious person and at first she thought that it was just her anxiety kicking in but the event was beyond anything in 40 years that she has ever experienced). Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6200) for covid-19 immunization and experienced tired a little bit. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced 2nd dose- went into a tachycardia event that was beyond anything she has ever had in the past 40 years (hospitalization) on 17Mar2021 with outcome of recovered on unknown date, accompanied with a panic attack (hospitalization) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, 2nd dose- extremely exhausted (non-serious) on 15Mar2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Mar2021, trauma (non-serious) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Reported as she got her second dose on 15Mar2021 and both her husband and her were extremely exhausted, not sleepy, just tired. They were told to expect that though. There was no pain or nothing at the injection site for her. Then 2 days later she went into a tachycardia event that was beyond anything she has ever had in the past 40 years. She knew how to take care of these events and they are usually accompanied with a panic attack and she can usually calm it with breathing. But this was extreme, it was beyond anything in the past 40 years that she has ever experienced. Her husband took her to the hospital and they checked her out and she was okay and her heart did calm down. But what was interesting was that ever since that event on 15Mar2021 she had not had 1 panic attack or one tachycardia episode. She had a slight one not to long ago but it was not like the ones that she used to get. She used to get these events fairly often in a short period of time. She is not sure if the COVID vaccine did anything, but she was grateful if it did but she just wanted to make that comment about the good. 2nd dose- She was extremely exhausted and this began soon after she had the COVID vaccine fairly early in the day. Her and her husband came home soon afterwards and looked at each other and said that they were tired and it was not sleepiness, it was not like they needed a nap. It was profound tiredness and exhaustion. Her husband had it more so but they were both in bed for a couple hours. Neither had pain in the injection site though. This lasted for several hours into the evening. 2nd dose- Her tachycardia event was on 17Mar2021 which was two days after her COVID vaccine. Her husband took her to the emergency room in the early evening that day and when she got there the event was still occurring but it was not as severe. She was in the emergency room for a couple of hours, so late that night she was released and when she went home she was tired. Which she usually is tired after her tachycardia events occur. But while in the emergency room everything checked out. She confirms that she has recovered completely. She was curious if anyone else has reported anything with this same kind of thing she has experienced. She is amazed because she has had lots of trauma in the last week with her grandson and normally an event like that would have her over the top but she has been calm about it. He was 21 years old and he attempted suicide and she cannot believe it. He was out of state and she was so close to him. At the very last moment he told his dad that he is making a mistake and he just can not stand the isolation from college. This normally would send her into the worst but she has been very calm and maybe it just has not all hit her yet and then also the recent events with her husband would normally make her very frightened. She is glad that she has not had any tachycardia events but this all started when she was 43 years old and she usually gets them periodically. She declined a transfer since it is lunch time and she needs to wake her husband for his lunch. She remembered reading articles while she was waiting for her first dose and tachycardia jumped out at her as a side effect and her husband first thought was that seeing that triggered her but she didn&#39;t have anything after the first dose so she dismissed it but then it occurred after her second dose. She was more amazed that she has not had an attack since then and she has not had any tachycardia and she has had them for years and she is just so grateful. The events require a visit to Emergency Room. Not to Physician Office: not really because she did it on her own and then she got in contact with her doctors.

An 81-Year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; formulation: solution for injection; Lot Number: EL9264; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 05Feb2021 (at the age of 81-Year-old) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history included cholesterol and taking medication for cholesterol. The patient stated, she received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9266; formulation: solution for injection; expiration date: unknown) via unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient stated this was the story. She received her two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and the last one received was two and half week ago. Now it&#39;s two and half week later and found that number one, after the first dose about 8 days later (unknown date in Feb2021), her blood pressure went up very high. Its normally never get that high. It went up to about 180, 190 even 200 over 80 and then she saw her physician. So, the physician put her on some blood pressure medication, and she got better and then had second vaccine. After that the same thing happen about a week later. Her blood pressure went very high, and she suffered because of it with a lot of anxiety. She wanted to know something about that the blood pressure goes really very high. It was still not regular; it was very irregular. Also, the other thing she wanted to talk about was that when she received the first dose, she had a headache and was slightly nauseous on unknown date in 2021. When she went for the second dose, she did not even look when she was putting a needle in her arm so, felt that the needle went in but shortly after heard her say oh jeez and she know she put it right in her arm, she thought might be she was bleeding, she did not have a look, ended up with a bandage over it and that was it, other day she see it did not have any blood on it. So, one of her friend told her that he had a similar thing happen to him where he felt that some of the vaccine was running down his arm (Further clarification was unknown, hence split was not made) and she was wondering if she got the full dose of the second vaccine, she had absolutely no side effects immediately after over the next day. Also, she took yesterday a test for antibody and that came out negative. The caller wanted to know that if she had antibody now with the two doses.

At this time, the patient indicated that this happened with the last dose. I noticed her dizziness and pale advised the patient to lie down legs propped up and gave her some water to drink. Attempted to take blood pressure with her own blood pressure cuff but the batteries died out. Continued to monitor for another 15 minutes, while patient continued to lie down and sipping water. After an additional 15 minutes passed I remembered we had a blood pressure cuff in the emergency kit , blood pressure reading was 138/56 and pulse was 76. Pt stated she felt better and wanted to escort us to the door. I advised against getting up and discussed the event with her son in law. Advised to monitor mother in law, call 911 if symptoms worsen. I also asked the son in law to escort us to the door so that the patient did not feel the need to get up out of the bed. Placed a call to person of contact on homebound list, Daughter currently out of town. Advise daughter of the event and to follow-up with her mother to see if she is okay, call 911 if symptoms worsen, and to follow up with PCP regarding event and any other concerns.

A 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 21Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Thyroid issues, whole body hurts, car accident in 2006 (lost her arm and husband, she only has part of her right arm), A-Fib, cardioversion (about a little over a month ago), heart disorder. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for heart, thyroid medication. The patient previously received the Shingle shots for immunization and experienced tired the next day. The patient experienced increased heart rate, felt dizzy and sick on 21Jan2021. She got the shot on 21Jan2021. She was ok at first but then about 4pm when got home she felt dizzy and sick. She took her heart rate and it was 156. She had A-Fib but just had a cardioversion about a little over a month ago so this really scared her. She felt really sick and didn&#39;t want to go into the hospital. She was ok overnight other than her heart was beating too fast. She took her heartrate this morning (22Jan2021) and it was back to 67-70. Today she is just taking it easy. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. The second dose is due on 13Feb2021. She is leery of getting it but is going to talk her heart doctor about it and will also see her primary care doctor on Monday. She had a Thyroid issues, things like that. Basically her whole body hurts, this is something that was going on prior to the shot. The only issue with the shot is the increase in her heart rate. There was no treatment, she had nothing to take for this, she doesn&#39;t think Tylenol would have helped but she doesn&#39;t know. The patient&#39;s mom had cancer. The outcome of the events was recovered on 22Jan2021.

Client declined stating she felt better and would take her medication when she arrived home. RN encouraged her to call her physician when she got home. A friend drove her home . A follow-up call was made at 1:46 p.m. by reporting RN.  Client stated she took medication, was resting and BP was 168/70, and she was planning to call her doctor.  She felt the episode was due to the exertion of going directly upstairs to the rest room, rather than sitting down in observation area.

                                                elevated blood pressure; a sensation of tingling on the right side of her chest and her right arm; burning sensation in my chest and right arm; felling dizzy/light-headed and &#34;crummy&#34;; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient herself) via a Pfizer sponsored program Pfizer First Connect, and via Medical Information Team. An 82-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cancer and blood pressure issues (she had been treated prior to vaccination). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient received her first dose of Pfizer-Biontech Covid19 vaccine on 27Jan2021. She has since been feeling dizzy, light-headed and &#34;crummy&#34; in Jan2021. She reports going to the ER (emergency room) yesterday morning (08Feb2021) reporting an elevated blood pressure, with dizziness and a sensation of tingling on the right side of her chest and her right arm (the same arm that was vaccinated). Her MD says that she should not take the second dose, but her daughter-in-law who is a nurse says that it is her (the patient&#39;s) decision. On 27Jan2021, patient had been having issues with her blood pressure- sent to the ER yesterday morning- blood tests twice already. BP elevated and dizzy because she had a burning sensation in her chest and right arm in 2021. The patient supposed to get second dose on Wednesday doctor says not to take it, since she was experiencing adverse event, and her HCP sited the deaths in as a reason for her not to receive the second dose. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                Got her vaccine, came home drove herself, had no problem whatsoever, felt perfectly fine during the day.  She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 16Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date (she has had Asthma for about 14-15 years), broke back from an unknown date (she broke her back about 3 years ago); stent placement from an unknown date (she had 2 heart stents placed about 2 years ago), and then she said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 16Mar2021. She said she would really like to know if the COVID-19 Vaccine possibly caused her to have the worse asthma attack she ever had in her life on 17Mar2021. She clarified she was talking to her friend on the telephone when she had her asthma attack at 3:30PM. She said that on 18Mar2021 at 5:00AM, she had a second asthma attack. She said her second asthma attack was not as bad as the one she had on 17Mar2021. For her first asthma attack on 17Mar2021, she took 2 puffs from her inhaler, and then an additional 2 puffs (4 puffs total). She said her doctor told her if she had a bad asthma attack, she could take 2 more puffs from the inhaler. She said she normally takes 2 puffs from her inhaler. She said for her second asthma attack on 18Mar2021 she took only 2 puffs from her inhaler. After she took her 2 puffs from her ProAir HFA Albuterol Sulfate inhaler, she flopped back into her bed. She reported she normally has 3-4 asthma attacks a year. She reported that her doctor did a complete blood workup on 03Mar2021 and told her she was doing just lovely. The patient also reported she had a very mild heart attack and she can&#39;t even take low dose aspirin. The patient also reported she had another question about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) and wanted to know if anything in the list of the COVID-19 Vaccine ingredients would indicate her having a possible allergy to the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and/or Physician Office. The outcome of the event asthma attack was recovering, and for the heart attack was unknown.

An 82-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 82 years old. Medical history included history of a stroke from an unknown date (previous history of a stroke 19 months ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2(Lot# EW5318) on 07Feb2021, at 82 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event (no reaction). Other historical vaccine included Flu shot (influenza vaccine) on an unspecified date and experienced almost killed her. The patient reported no reaction and no problems (no pain, no nausea, no anything) from the second dose until the evening of 08Mar2021 when she was in her kitchen cooking and chopping vegetables, she felt the sudden urge to faint and then became so dizzy that she had to lie down on the couch. She had an overwhelming feeling of dizziness. A feeling like she wanted to faint, and she never faints. Her daughter got her to the sofa. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. The room spun unbelievably. Everything spun. She went to bed and when she woke up, she felt worse. She states that the dizziness was worse, she was unable to visually focus, if she closed her eyes and she opened one eye it would be blurry and the people on TV were sliding off the screen and  everything was sliding away, and she had pain behind her left eye into her head. When she tried to get up to go to the bathroom the room was spinning. It lasted through the next day (09Mar2021). When she got up, she couldn&#39;t put her two feet on the floor out of bed without leaning towards the left. She didn&#39;t fall. It was so bad she had to grab onto things to walk.  During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on Mar2021 which included blood pressure, triglyceride, fluids or liquids: tested perfect; and CAT scan, EKG had unknown results. On 11Mar2021, CT Scan: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem); MRI: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of overwhelming feeling of dizziness and unable to visually focus. Outcome of the event dizziness was not recovered; outcome of the event unable to visually focus (visual disturbance) was recovered on an unspecified date in Mar2021; while room was spinning (spinning sensation) was recovered on 09Mar2021, while unknown for the other events.

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a known history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.  She presented to the emergency room after being transported from a local nursing home.  Apparently, the patient was acting a little bit more confused than normal and she was looking more short of breath than normal.  The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.  Because of this, the nursing home made the decision to send the patient in.  When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.  The patient does have mild dementia and so is somewhat of an unreliable historian.  Transferred to pleural effusion

A 82-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 at the age of 82-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient took the shot at the regional vaccination center and she had an appointment of course set up by her doctor, but they don&#39;t have any specific name. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medication included metoprolol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The reporter stated that his/her mother experienced a reaction after having the shot. She took the shot on 12Mar2021 and suffered from atrial fibrillation and she has not had atrial fibrillation in over 13 months and once she took the shot on the very next day (13Mar2021) she had atrial fibrillation which lasted about two and a half day. They went to her heart doctor and they checked her out and they said that other people that had taken the vaccine had experience the same thing so, the reporter was calling to see if that was something Pfizer has heard before or not. It was reported that the patient was scheduled to take the second shot this coming Friday and after speaking with her doctor they indicated to go ahead and take the second shot but again the reporter wanted to report this because the reporter knew the company was keeping a record of this information. It was reported that the patient was about 5 feet 7 inches and probably 140 pounds. The outcome of the event was recovered on 15Mar2021.

Patient?s symptoms improving with antiplatelet and statin therapies along with blood pressure management. Per Neurology consult, possible etiologies include cardioembolic versus atheroembolic versus thrombotic versus inflammatory related to recent COVID-19 vaccine. The neurologist specifically stated that ?The COVID vaccine was temporally close to this event. I have seen transient CNS inflammation from the vaccine--probability low but still possibility.?

Sometime after the afternoon of 2/7/21 and the morning of 2/8/21 she was found unconscious and unresponsive on the floor.  As her dinner from the evening of 2/7/21 was still on the table unfinished and she was fully dressed we assume that whatever caused her to end up on the floor unconscious happened on 2/7/21  She was taken to the emergency room and it was determined that she was not going to survive.  She never regained consciousness and was having seizures all the way to the hospital in the back of the ambulance.  She was made comfortable and passed on 2/11/21.

An 82-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER CORONA VIRUS VACCINES-COVID-19), dose 2 intramuscularly administered in the right arm on 04Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER CORONA VIRUS VACCINES-COVID-19) on an unspecified date for Covid-19 immunisation. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); calcium; acetylcysteine, calcium levomefolate, mecobalamin (METAFOLBIC PLUS); losartan; hydrochlorothiazide; denosumab (PROLIA) and trazodone; all indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was unknown if the patient receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that in the evening of the vaccination (04Mar2021), she developed chills and fever, then chest pain and shortness of breath. The physician obtained a CXR (chest x-ray) on the patient on 04Mar2021 and found that she had pneumonia. She was treated with levofloxacin and prednisone. The physician rechecked her in one week and gave her Kenalog injection and Rocephin injection. The physician rechecked her on 22Mar2021 and she was improved, but she returned to the office 12Apr2021 with left leg swelling. The ultrasound on 12Apr2021 showed an occlusive clot in her femoral artery. The patient was admitted to the hospital (Apr2021) for 1 day and placed on heparin, then sent home on Eliquis. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and the patient received treatment which included antibiotics and steroids for pneumonia and blood thinners for the femoral vein clot. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events leg swelling, occlusive clot in her femoral artery and femoral vein clot were recovered on Apr2021 while the outcome of the other events was recovered on 22Mar2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events peripheral swelling, peripheral artery thrombosis and venous thrombosis limb and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.The case will be reassessed once new information is available.

Chest xray showed radiographic evidence of pneumonia in RLL but without evidence of acute PE on CT scan. Patient was requiring 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations and so was placed on high flow nc with better response 4/23 remained on HFNC 4/24 BCx from 4.22.21 growing out gram positive cocci in 1/2 bottles 4/26 HFNC at 50% and 45L 4/27 off HFNC and on 6 L NC/ awaiting PT evaluation 4/28 per, OT assessment -- pt dropped into 70&#39;s on 6L 02 with short walk to bathroom and toileting tasks. cues for rest and PLB needed to increase 02 into 80s. with a seated rest break over 5 mins 02 increased to 88% on 6L  COVID pneumonia (first dose of Pfizer vaccine mid April) S/P remdesivir X 5 days, now on day 8/10 decadron but will go home on oral decadron  Acute hypoxic respiratory failure slowly improving (not on home oxygen therapy) now off HFNC, was on 10 L oxymask.

Patient agreeable with this plan  Transaminitis levels trending downwards.    History of thymoma s/p VATS 2011 -outpatient follow up   Positive blood culture on admission, contaminant in 1 of 2 blood culture bottles. Repeat blood cultures showed no growth. Not on antibiotics   Associated attestation  - 04/22/2021 3:39 PM EDT   Formatting of this note might be different from the original. Patient seen and examined. Current status reviewed with resident staff. I have reviewed pertinent physician documentation, laboratory and radiographic data. I have initiated therapies based upon this reviewed  In brief 82-year-old woman with history of COPD, mediastinal mass status post VATS with benign thymoma with local recurrence presented with respiratory tract symptoms since 6 days prior to admission COVID testing is positive. In the emergency room she was noted be hypoxemic requiring 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations. She is currently on high-flow feels much improved.  I concur with exam as per Pulmonary fellow. Laboratories and imaging reviewed in detail.  Impression COVID-19 infection COVID-19 pneumonia Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring high-flow oxygen Thrombocytopenia which is new since 2016 and a poor prognostic sign History of benign thymoma with local recurrence COPD with exacerbation Doubt bacterial pneumonia  Recommendation: Remdesavir 5 days Corticosteroids. Optimum dosing induration of corticosteroids has yet to be fully defined. Decadron 6 mg daily is reasonable however if develops progressive disease in the next 24 hr would escalate corticosteroids and would also add IL 6 inhibitor Additional minerals and vitamin supple role is unclear but probably benign If thrombocytopenia worsens may need alternative anticoagulation. Would check venous Dopplers Supplemental oxygen for saturations greater than 88% Daily PPI unless anticoagulation intensified then would go to q.12 hours Would favor discontinuing antibiotics

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine, I started feeling tired and my arm was quite sore. The following day, I had a fever of probably 100. I had chills and my heart rate and blood pressure went up. Since I have A-Fib, it was irregular. After several hours, my HR went back to normal and that is when I called my Cardiologist NP. She said that she thinks it&#39;s related to the fever I had. The next day, I felt a tad better, but fatigue and generally not feeling well lasted a few days. I feel that it took about a week before I felt normal again. About two months later, I was making plans to go out of town and I became very ill. I started having chills, fever, nausea and extreme fatigue. I may have taken some Tylenol. I was drinking a lot of water because I did not have an appetite. A couple days later I felt a little better so I did not contact my doctor, but I did go to an urgent care (05/22/2021) and had a COVID test. The test came back negative and I felt better two days later. On Monday, I started feeling bad again and I contacted my PCP, and I went to see him on Tuesday. He ran some blood tests and another COVID test, which came back negative. The fatigue just stayed around for quite some time. He monitored my sodium and chloride and they were both low so the doctor wanted them monitored. I was admitted into the hospital for two days. I was on liquid restriction. I had a bunch of tests ran that came back negative. I did have an AMA test which did come back positive. I am still on water restriction, but I am feeling much better. I&#39;m a bit leery about receiving a booster shot.

She saw her Primary Care Dr on  5/10/2021 after experiencing dizziness, fatigue, confusion.  She had lost a considerable amount of weight during this time and I was concerned and accompanied her to the doctor visit.

The number on her release folder to obtain medical Records.  My mother was residing with me my home until her appointment for evaluation .  She passed away on 6/02/2021 in my home.. Dr  was contacted to sign off on her Death Certificate .  I have not received Death Certificate as of today but I believe the cause she was putting was Natural Causes due to age.

The patient experienced heart attack on 19Apr2021, groin hernia in Mar2021, lower extremity mass in Mar2021, acute haemorrhagic ulcerative colitis on 13Apr2021, diarrhea on 13Apr2021, bowel obstruction on Apr2021, fluid loss on 13Apr2021, arterial occlusion on 19Apr2021, hemorrhoids in Apr2021, postoperative pain in Apr2021. The patient hospitalized from 18Apr2021 to 25Apr2021 due to these events. It was reported that the patient with events of heart attack, groin hernia, big lump on groin, bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis, diarrhea, blockage in bowels, loss of fluids and artery was blocked and non-serious possible hemorrhoids and postoperative pain with Humira  40mg/0.4ml (Adalimumab). In Mar2021, the patient experienced groin hernia and big lump on groin. In Apr2021, the patient experienced blockage in bowels, possible hemorrhoids and postoperative pain. On 13Apr2021, the patient experienced bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis, diarrhea and loss of fluids. On 19Apr2021, the patient experienced heart attack and artery was blocked. On 19Apr2021, the heart attack and artery was blocked resolved. On 20Apr2021, the diarrhea resolved. On 25Apr2021, the bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis resolved. In Apr2021, the groin hernia, big lump on groin, blockage in bowels, loss of fluids, possible hemorrhoids and postoperative pain resolved. Pfizer Biontech covid-19 vaccine (Tozinameran) was also considered suspect. Unknown stool softener also considered as suspect. In Mar2021, patient felt a big lump on her groin that was determined by physician as a hernia through physical examination and not an imaging test. On 09Apr2021 she had an outpatient surgery due to hernia in her groin. When she took acetaminophen as prescribed she had a blockage in her bowels and took unspecified stool softener which caused terrible diarrhea. On 16Apr2021 she went to the emergency room due to the diarrhea and had loss of fluids and just went home even when advised not to go home. On 18Apr2021 she was continued having diarrhea, she went back to the emergency room and had unspecified blood test that confirmed she was having a heart attack while on emergency room due to not taking her medications for the heart because was told not to take any medication while having diarrhea which she also temporarily interrupted her Humira while having diarrhea. Physician advised to admit patient to the hospital as she was told she was having a heart attack. On 19Apr2021, she had another stent because the artery was blocked from her previous stent. On 25Apr2021 she was discharged. She believed that her hospitalization was prolonged to nine days (as reported) due to she was bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative Colitis. She had a shot of covid 19 vaccine before at least one symptom happened therefore covid 19 vaccine was considered as co suspect product. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. On Jan2021, patient received first dose COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer. On Feb2021, patient received second dose COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer. The patient was treated with acetaminophen. The patient underwent other lab tests and procedures which included blood test: heart attack on 18Apr2021, laboratory test with unknown results in 2021. The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the events heart attack, Arterial occlusion/artery was blocked, Postoperative pain was recovered on 19Apr2021. The outcome of the event groin hernia, Lower extremity mass/big lump on her groin, Bowel obstruction, Fluid loss, Hemorrhoids was recovered in Apr2021; of the event Acute haemorrhagic ulcerative colitis was recovered on 25Apr2021; of the event Diarrhea was recovered on 20Apr2021.  The reporter&#39;s causality for the events of heart attack, groin hernia, big lump on groin, bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis, diarrhea, blockage in bowels, loss of fluids, artery was blocked, possible hemorrhoids and post operative pain with humira 40mg/0.4ml (adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the BNT162B2 was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  Manufacturer opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of heart attack, groin hernia, big lump on groin, bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis, diarrhea, blockage in bowels, loss of fluids, artery was blocked, possible hemorrhoids and post operative pain are related to humira 40mg/0.4ml(adalimumab).   No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Per her hospital admission note, she stated that she felt fine, stood up, became dizzy and was able to lower herself to her chair then went unresponsive for a few minutes, but did regain consciousness. When she arrived to the emergency department, she was in atrial fibrillation with RVR with rate in the 140-150s. While the AFib is long standing, the RVR is new and potentially unexplainable. This was resolved with cardizem drip ending at 2220 on 01/25/2021.   Alternatively, this patient is being put into VAERS as there are 2 other patients hospitalized with cardiac issues and received vaccine from the same pharmacy with the same lot number.

Patients troponin level then elevated and it was determined patient was having a NSTEMI.  1/24/21- patient had recurrent episodes of SVT and family decided patient would benefit from further cardiac workup so she was transferred to a higher level of care. Unknown if patient has discharge from the facility we transferred her to.  This patient is felt to be of significance since she is 1/3 patients currently in our facility who developed cardiac/blood issues post vaccination from the same pharmacy with the same lot number vaccine. VAERS reports were put in for all three to determine if further investigation is needed.

An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: TL9261, expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 16:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. On 25Jan2021, the patient experienced having acid reflux, pain in her chest/stomach that lasted all night last night and was worse when lying down. When she burped, it relieved some pressure. She had strange visions flashing in her head while trying to sleep on 25Jan2021. The patient was wondering if she was having a reaction from the vaccine. On 25Jan2021, after over an hour after the vaccine, she started having severe pain in the chest and stomach area and she couldn&#39;t sleep last night at all. She was awake all night, burping up acid. She was wondering if those were reaction to the vaccine, should she go see her doctor or what should she do about that. She got her first dose on 25Jan2021 and she started having chest and stomach pain the same day at about 6 PM. She was burping acid all night and early in the morning of 26Jan2021 and she was having these strange things like pictures going to her head that were weird. She was not sleeping but they were strange images, they were strange, they weren&#39;t normal. She says with that added in it sounds crazy. She has her vaccine card that says she should get the next one 15Feb2021. She wanted to avoid catching the corona. She had drank acid yesterday and she was wondering if that was causing her to have acid reflux. She clarified that she drank a lot of acidic liquids on 25Jan2021 and she was wondering if that might have had something to do with it, like orange juice and cranberry juice so she is wondering did that have anything to do with it, the acidity maybe made her stomach have acid reflux because she has had that in the past. She asked if she should go to the doctor. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She treated at home with benedryl and hydrocortisone.  On 2/13 she continued to have itching/rash and also developed a welt at the injection site. She visited the urgent care where she had an elevated blood pressure of 210/100 and 170/90. As an ICU nurse, I can attest that my mother?s blood pressure always runs in the 90s-100 systolic range. She received an injection of solumedrol and Benadryl orally and was given a prescription for prednisone for 3 days total.

Caller was asking if she should get the second shot. She went to her doctor and was told it was ok if she got the second shot. The doctor said it was too far between the shot and the reactions for it to be the shot. She received the vaccine on 27Jan2021. On Saturday morning she took Vitamin D, B complex, Digoxin and Rosuvastatin. Twenty minutes later her chin felt funny. Her face was red and burning. She felt like she was going to faint. She got some ice and washed her face. She took 2 baby aspirin. She asked her doctor if she was allergic to the vaccine. Her doctor said the time between getting the vaccine and the events were too far between. She thought she was going to pass out. She felt better after washing her face with ice. She was her face for 30-45 minutes with ice water.  She took apixaban (ELIQUIS) before and her chin felt funny. She added that her blood pressure went up and she had trembles. She felt dizzy. Clarified that she felt that way prior to taking the vaccine. At first she didn&#39;t think to take her blood pressure. When she took it the reading was 165/79. At 3:00 pm the reading was 162/79. At 6:00 pm the reading was down to 150/79. The trembles started two hours after she took her medications. When providing product details she stated she took two Vitamin D. The label indicated to take one. When asking for indication caller asked what does Vitamin D do? She was able to answer herself. Product is filled in a pharmacy bottle and does not include NDC, Lot or expiry. Prior to taking rivaroxaban (XARELTO), she was taking apixaban (ELIQUIS) 5 mg twice daily. Lot: ABL8694A, Expiry: Dec2022, It came from another country. She was sure she was allergic to it because she had a rash. That was when she was switched to rivaroxaban. She was taking levothyroxine 100 mcg until she turned 82. In Jan2021, the dose was changed to 112 mcg daily. Her last thyroid level was high on the test with a result of 7.46. The dose was changed to 112 mcg daily.  Initially caller gave consent to contact her physician. She changed her mind stating she didn&#39;t want her doctor to think she was going over her head. She was worried and frightened at the time because something happened to her. She can&#39;t remember if her face was swollen. She drank some ice cold water and took two baby aspirins. She knew she needed to flush her system. She just wanted to make she was safe in getting the shot. Her doctor told her to take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) if she ever felt that way. She felt fine after getting the shot and the few days after getting it. She wanted to get the shot. Events resulted in physician office visit. The action taken in response to the events for vitamin D, vitamin b complex, digoxin, rosuvastatin was dose not changed. The outcome of event &#34;She thought she was going to pass out&#34; was unknown.

They x-rayed leg and found nothing  unusual for a woman my age.  Then they conducted a scan and discovered a blood clot behind my knee.  Since then, I have had intermittent pain. The Doctor referred me to a hematologist which I will see this week.  Prior to the vaccination have never had a blood clot.  It occurred three days after the vaccination.  Coincidence?  I think not.

She does have rosacea but this was worse.  After she got home she began to feel her heart beating rapidly.  She had taken her medications, but about 6:00 PM she took an extra dose of Metoprolol and waited until about 8:00 PM and the rapid heart beat was still there.  Her son took her BP and it was extremely high and it was 119/68, pulse 112.   At 11:00 her BP was 108/59 with a pulse of 78.   She was able to sleep but did feel heaviness the day later and rapid beating had subsided.   She is still having the rosacea, tingling, stinging of her face.  Her vaccine site was not even sore and he no problems with that.  She called her doctor and the nurse called her back, and she has been trying to call the place where she got the vaccine.  She was told to make sure what to do before she gets the 2nd shot.   She has recovered from the rapid heart beat episode, but the skin stinging of her face is still ongoing.

Brought to ER The Four Paramedics that came to take her to the ER stated they were overwhelmed with calls for post covid vaccine problems and that ALL of their vehicles were out on calls many due to this.  Agressive workup including CT, EKG, Cardiac monitoring, CTA neck and Brain, Carotid and peripheral dopplers and vascualar surgeon consultation revealed nothing. Told it temporally had to be assoc with the vaccine??  I am reporting so that this can be evaluated for confirmation.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

Five days later she had an identical reaction but it was on her left side of her face. A month later her blood was tested and she has had an  abnormally low blood platelet count.

She had felt well and had been in her usual state of health, and was able to cook and enjoy a turkey dinner with 5 individuals on 03/07/21, but on 03/08/21 she began to develop progressive generalized weakness up to the point where she remained in bed for several days.  She could not support herself when attempting to rise from bed.  She noted poor PO intake with nausea, no vomiting.  Loose stools for several days, no noted stool blood.  Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.  She was unable to elaborate regarding the falls but admitted to hitting her head at least once, unable to say if she lost consciousness or if she felt presyncopal symptoms before falling.  She had initially presented on 03/12/21 to ED for evaluation, workup negative, labs and imaging normal.  CT brain found no acute process.  She was sent home with arrangements for home PT.  She returned to ED 03/15/21 when symptoms had not improved.  In the ED she was found to be afebrile, significantly hypertensive, mildly tachycardic, &#43; orthostatic vital signs.  Labs significant for heme occult positive stool, proBNP 397, WBC 10.1, H/H 13.4/39.9, PLT 493, UA neg for infection.  COVID neg.  CXR found slightly increased interstitial markings.  MRI brain found no acute intracranial abnormality.  She was evaluated by PT and found to be unsafe to DC home as she could not ambulate without leaning backward and to the right and needed 1-2 assist.  She was admitted to HM service for further management.  She has remained consistently afebrile.  She continues to experience significant gait instability, cognitive slowing, and difficulty with finger-to-nose testing with noted dysmetria, no focal weakness.

An 83 years old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at age of 83 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hip surgery a few months ago and she was still kind of stiff and sore. Concomitant medications included lisinopril at low dose 10 mg once daily taken for blood pressure abnormal about 10 years ago; clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for transient ischaemic attack from 2012 (she believed it was a around that time); acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN LOW) at low dose (she began taking this before the Lisinopril so it has been several years).The patient mentioned that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and everything was fine that day and the day after. At late in the day on 04Mar2021, she experienced a lot of problems which she mentioned was the worst experience in her life. She was 99% sure it was from the vaccine because she didn&#39;t experience anything like that before getting the vaccine. She mentioned that she experienced side effects all night like her heart beating really fast, a headache, a stiff neck, her nerves pounding all throughout her body, and a blood pressure of 174/78. She mentioned that it was the worst she&#39;s felt so far as compared to going to the ER, as she&#39;s experienced before. She did not go to the ER as she could not drive herself and she was living alone. She mentioned that she better the next day although it was not totally gone, she was a little shake and kind of weak. As of calling, she said that she was feeling okay and better than yesterday (07Mar2021) in which the effects were still present. She mentioned that it was horrible, very scary, she was very ill, very uncomfortable, really bad, and didn&#39;t want to go through that again. She didn&#39;t know if she would make it through the night. She was asking for what to do and asking if there needed to be an adjustment for her dose because she was a very small person. She didn&#39;t want to have the 2nd shot if she went through that again. It was the worst experience of her life. She was not sure what to do now about her second shot. She had the first shot 02Mar2021 and everything was fine, 03Mar2021 she was okay but on 04Mar2021 she had, by night time, she had a lot of scary things that had never happened to her before. Her heart was pounding she could hear it in her ears. Her head, her neck felt stiff and her head felt heavy, her whole body felt heavy and like the nerves in her whole body were just aggravated, it was hard to explain. She had ringing in her ears. Her blood pressure was 174/78 and she was just afraid to have the second shot, it was scary, it was really bad. She was wondering if the amount of the vaccine was too much for her.  She confirmed it was the evening 04Mar2021 when all this began. She said all of this was pretty well recovered at this point. She said the day after that happened, she was shaky but today (08Mar2021) she was fine. She did not know what it would be medications they are looking for but she was on normal medicine for old people she guesses. This was so bad that she really was not going to take the second dose unless they can tell her if she should or that they should give her less or something like that. The outcome of events was recovered in Mar2021.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a Contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was none medical history. Concomitant medication included atenolol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Her leg was swollen and there was edema and there was a lump on the side and it was pink or getting red and she was on medicine (Clarification Unknown) for 7 days, twice a day and the leg is still (incomplete sentence), the edema has gone down some. The leg was still pink and it is tender to touch and if she stand on her leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts. She got pain. She was also sleeping whereby she was watching television and all of sudden she was sound sleep and she wake up over an hour or two after that and then she awake for a while but she have no trouble sleeping at night again. She had chest pain and it&#39;s not angina because that she did have (Further clarification was unknown if consumer had angina in past hence not captured on tab) but it&#39;s a sharp pain and it does not want her taking Nitroglycerin because it went away and it last for maybe (incomplete sentence) it just like a stabbed wound. She was dizzy. That&#39;s still, it&#39;s not like what it was but it is getting less but she was still dizzy. She cannot walk a straight line. She lived in an apartment house and she had to walk down the hall to go down the stair but she sometime had to stop because she was dizzy. she kind of lean against the wall for few seconds and then she continued on. Concern was not the word for it. It made her very nervous and the circulation was very poor in both feet now and one leg, the right leg that has the pink and still the tenderness in that leg. The foot turns very dark pink and the big toe that she had turned dark purple. She wrote everything down and she will say this at the time after the injection she did not have any problem until about four days later but she did have problem with doing my cross- word puzzles and doing her puzzles. She could not do any of her puzzles, nothing was computing in her brain (Clarification unknown) but that&#39;s coming back slowly, so is that to be expected. Start date of event: Consumer stated &#34;It was 4 days after the 5th, about 09Feb2021. She went there and saw a doctor an MD of course and she went there on 12th so it was a week later. She went because the pain was terrible. The outcome of events Leg is still pink and it is tender to touch; If I stand on my leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts, I got pain; Dizzy; is not recovered, all of sudden she was sound sleep; Cannot walk a straight line; Nervous; Circulation is very poor in both feet now; Foot turns very dark pink and the big toe that I have turned dark purple; Nothing was computing in my brain; pain was terrible was unknown, outcome of the other events was recovering. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                She received her second COVID shot at the end of March first week of April. My mother had a stroke, several seizure and her lungs were filled with blood clots. She had to have a procedure to remove the largest one next to her heart. My mother has always been healthy and has never had any of the following issues in her life. She gets regular checkup and I spoke with her on April 19, 2021 at 12:00pm Central time and she was fine but at 1:20pm my brother who is staying at her house said she was having a seizure. I talk to my mother at least four times a day and she has never in 83yrs experienced anything like this. She doesn?t remember right now where her shot was administered but my brother took her but he is mad at me because I have full power of attorney and he is not happy. Therefore, he will not give me the information that is needEd to give to your office. My mother was admitted to the ICU. She is now at their rehab center in a hospital.  Once my mother is released from the hospital she is moving with me out of state. This is and unexpected expense that I will need assistance with but I don?t mind because it is my mother and now someone has to be with her 24/7.

An 83-year-old female patient (5 feet 1 inches, about 120 pounds) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6198, patient was not sure) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Feb2021 (83-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose; the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (83-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she has got both the shots of Pfizer (Covid-19 vaccine) and at the end of the first one or it is like eighteen days, just before the second shot, something happened with her knee and it has just got worse (from 12Mar2021). She did not connect that with the Pfizer shot and I was thinking maybe it is a pulled muscle or something but it is very bad now. She would like to know what she can do. Also, she is thinking may be blood clot at this point and she would like to have it checked. She thinks that she should be able to contact somebody to actually get some physical test on this. She tried heat and cold alternate and Absorbine Jr. and Aspirin. It varied with the days, she thinks she has taken Aspirin about twice a day and it is a tablet and it was 325 mg and she took two of those, orally. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event and included &#34;heat and cold alternate and Absorbine Jr. and Aspirin&#34;. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE),  via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose (at the age of 83-years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included the patient had known allergies (unspecified) and unspecified chronic health conditions from an unknown date.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The patient was not pregnant. The patient received unspecified concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 15Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough. The events resulted in emergency room visit and the patient was hospitalized (from an unknown date) for the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough for 6 days. The clinical course is as follows: 2 or 3 weeks after the patient got the vaccine she started getting out of breath when she walked. Each day she got worse. Then the patient was taken to the hospital where they discovered the patient had three blood clots. The clots were in the patient&#39;s leg, heart and lung. The patient stated the Doctors do not understand where the clots came from. The patient was in the hospital 6 days. The patient stated they are still having breathing problem and still on oxygen as needed and they still cough at night. The patient asked if there have been any other reports of this happening to other people who got the vaccine as the patient never had blood clots before this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (nasal swab): negative on 15Mar2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough and included blood thinners and oxygen therapy and complete bed rest. The clinical outcome of the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough was not recovered.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                STROKE; Facial droop; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.  An 83-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular on 02Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9809) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation; and carbidopa, levodopa (DUOPA), via percutaneous j-tube from 2018 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) and ongoing, at unspecified dose for advanced parkinson&#39;s disease.  Medical history included maternal history of strokes, and paternal history of strokes, both on unspecified dates. Concomitant medication included carbidopa, levodopa taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Historical vaccination included first dose of BNT162B2 on 20Jan2021, intramuscular, with lot number: EL19261 for covid-19 immunization.  The patient experienced stroke on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, and facial droop on Apr2021 with outcome of recovering. Details were reported as follows: The patient felt like she experienced a mini stroke in Apr 2021. She had her Peg and J tube replaced on 16Apr2021 because they came completely out. Her husband was not sure if the pump was working states he could not saw the medication. Her husband had the pump disconnected from her. NCM advised her husband to run the pump over paper towels. Her husband did as instructed and could then saw the medication. He then connected patient to the pump and the pump ran without any error codes or alarms. Her husband wanted to make sure patient did not need a new pump since she got new tubing. NCM assured that the current pump seemed to be working fine with the new tubing. She left sided mouth droop in Apr 2021. She was taken to the local hospital via emergency medical services (EMS). She was then transferred to Hospital in for evaluation. She was in the ER awaiting a bed for 20 hours. The primary reporter did not know if any tests or medicine obtained as he did not receive any paperwork. After 20 hours, she was discharged from the ER home. She had a brain waves test a few days later to confirm if stroke had occurred. The primary reporter stated he did not feel the COVID vaccine was related to he events of Mouth droop and possible stroke. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included brain waves test: results pending on 21Apr2021.  The action taken in response to the event(s) for bnt162b2 was not applicable, and for carbidopa, levodopa was dose not changed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information provided, considering the age and medical history of the patient, the event stroke is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2. The event &#34;facial drop&#34; is assessed as symptom of the event stroke, hence not related to BNT162B2 either. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Six days after the second dose of Pfizer I started experiencing shortness of breath so I went to the ER and took a chest x-ray and had fluid in my lungs. Doctors discovered I had Atrial Fibrillation. In January I had an Echo Cardiogram and none of the previous described diagnoses were present then. I was admitted; doctors attempted to shock my heart back into rhythm several times but were unsuccessful. Therefore, I was put on Eliquis (5mg) and a water pill to get rid of the fluid in my lungs (and swollen ankles). I was hospitalized for 9 days where I was evaluated through numerous tests. Eventually it was suggested that I undergo the Watchman&#39;s Procedure to get off blood thinners. Everything went well with that surgery on Thursday May 20th; complications arose after the surgery: heart rate and blood pressure spike, lungs started filling up with fluid. Ended up in ICU for four days. I still have a problem with my lungs despite having no history of lung problems and I am now dealing with AFIB. This all started 6 days after my second shot.

                                                Narrative: Patient with history advanced vascular dementia, hypertensive cerebrovascular disease and stroke, T2DM. Received her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 14:00 and was reported to have expired at home at 20:55. Dr. (Medical Director) spoke with patient&#39;s son/caregiver 2/4/21. Son reports that patient was in her usual health yesterday morning, deemed well enough by son to travel for vaccination. He reports she had no bothersome symptoms after either first or second vaccinations. Specifically denied rash, wheeze, and difficulty breathing. Son was with patient throughout the day. In the evening, when preparing for bed, he noted she became suddenly unresponsive in a similar fashion as she has done several times in past years. While in all previous such episodes she recovered within minutes, last evening she did not regain consciousness, experiences a brief period of labored breathing, and died. Patient&#39;s son called 911 and the patient&#39;s body was brought to the medical examiners. The medical examiner declined to proceed with autopsy. Patient&#39;s son is not interested in autopsy. Patient&#39;s son reports confidence that his mother&#39;s underlying hypertensive/diabetic cardiovascular disease is the natural cause of her death.

I fell backwards into the bathtub  knocking down both shower doors.  My legs were hanging over the edge of the tub.  One shower door fell on my upper right chest area.   This happened just over 24 hours from when I received the vaccine.  I had not felt bad at all from the vaccine.  Didn&#39;t sleep too well that night (2-4-2021) because I hurt due to the fall.  I called my doctor on 2-5-2021 to let her know I fainted 24 hours after receiving the vaccine and wondered if that was due to it.  I do feel weak today (2-5-2021).

                                                Patient is a 84-year-old female presenting to the emergency room with anxiousness, generalized weakness and one episode of vomiting/nausea surrounding her Covid vaccination this afternoon.  On exam patient appears mildly anxious, has no evidence of allergic reaction, lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.  Patient is resting comfortably, speaking in complete sentences.  Shortly after physical exam patient was noted to have oxygen saturation of 90 to 92%, subsequently placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Will obtain CBC, CMP, chest x-ray, EKG.  We will also give patient 500 cc of fluid and 4 mg of Zofran for control of nausea and vomiting.  We will continue to monitor patient. No leukocytosis, no AKI, electrolytes within normal limits, chest x-ray without evidence of underlying pneumonia or pneumothorax.  I have reevaluated patient, patient has been reporting a ongoing headache for which she has a history of and takes Fioricet, requesting Fioricet.  Will order Fioricet.  We attempted to take patient off of her oxygen however when taken off the oxygen she drops to 88% on room air.  Patient reports ongoing generalized weakness and nausea which has required an additional 4 mg Zofran.  Given that patient has been monitored for couple of hours and has had ongoing nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness in the setting of hypoxia when taken off of oxygen will obtain troponins and admit patient to the hospital for obs.  I have spoken to Dr. who has accepted patient to observation with telemetry for further management.  Patient was informed of admission status, with no further questions at this time.

Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

An 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm on 21Jan2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included oral cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received flu vaccine for immunization and reported that it made her sick for 10 days 4 or 5 years ago. The patient previously took Tylenol (takes 1 instead of 2, Everything she takes half the recommended dose). The patient experienced fast heartbeat, increased BP, weakness, dizziness, nausea and headache on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was further reported that she had a fast heart beat, her blood pressure went real high, she was dizzy and weak. This was while she was there and being watched for the 15 minutes by a nurse. She is 84 years old and doesn&#39;t take any medication; she did have oral cancer but with no chemo as it had not spread and this was 2 years ago. It was explained that the patient didn&#39;t feel good about it but she drove home. When she got home she was confused and felt like she could pass out. She walked through the house didn&#39;t know who she was, she just kept walking and walking. It was a strange feeling that lasted 15-20 minutes. She called her son late in the afternoon and told him to check on her to make sure she made it through the night. She still had funny feelings over the next few days but at this point she only has the dizziness that happens occasionally. She notes also that her blood pressure was checked at home by her and was higher than normal the first few days after but is now normal. Over the next day she had a headache and a little nausea, but it was not severe. She also mentions having a little soreness in her arm but not bad. She did read about the side effects and states she had the elevated heart rate, increase in blood pressure and dizziness right after getting it. The patient wonders could she ask for smaller dose, she only weighs about 110lb. When she spoke with her doctor she was told that the COVID virus is worse than what she experienced after the vaccine. She has not been to the doctor since getting the vaccine, she just talked to them. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: high and heart rate: fast on Jan2021. The patient was recovering from dizziness, the outcome of nausea was unknown and the patient recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

                                                Found down - day after vaccination.  Fall, potentially acute encephalopathy / confusion, hypertension (potential for non-compliance with antihypertensive medications?) - patient with known severe to advanced dementia / mild cognitive impairment.  Likely related to hypertensive encephalopathy with post-COVID vaccine prodrome with underlying advanced dementia.  Situation: hospitalization after a fall and hypertension emergency Background: Pt is an 84 y/o female pt with a log history of dementia, has been able to live alone safely until most recent illness/hospitalization. Assessment: Pt received her 2nd COVID vaccine on Saturday.  On Sunday, pt&#39;s sister was unable to get a hold of her as her sister calls her daily due to her dementia.  After several phone calls, her sister went to pt&#39;s home and found pt on her bedroom floor.  There was   some blood found, not sure from where.  Sisiter was unable to get pt up so EMS was called and pt was taken to ED.  She was evaluated, her BP was very elevated, she was admitted and testing was done.  Head CT/MRI was unchanged.  X-ray of her R shoulder shows a vertical non-displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity of the proximal humerous, no surgical intervention is recommended at this time, pt instructed to wear a sling for now. Pt is discharged home with Home Care and family support.

This went on all night off and on. She slept maybe about 3 hours total. Sometimes her legs feet and hands would feel tingly. And the flushing continue- it feels like her body was hot, but it was not hot to the touch. She had felt better this morning when she got up, but she did have one bout when she was just sitting here. She had improved overall. Caller stated she already spoke to the safety department but did not have any reference number to provide. The outcome of event &#39;Feeling flushed&#39; and &#39;Sometimes her legs feet and hands would feel tingly&#39; was recovered on 26Jan2021, of the other events was recovering.

                                                3/13/21 Ferrell ER to admission hpi: 84 y.o. female presented to the emergency room with complaints of back pain, nausea, and abdominal pain.  Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

I spoke with her twice and my uncle and aunt checked on her three times, all three she was freezing cold and too tired to get up. In the morning, she was dazed, cold and walked to the bathroom, where she collapsed to her death. Paramedics could not revive her. My mom died Saturday morning - within the 24-hour period of her vaccine. She was feeling so great leading up to it, active, stripping the guest bedroom sheets, bubbly, and excited for us to be able to finally visit her soon.

Around 3/2/2021, she saw her physician complaining of pain in her arm, which was attributed to gout.  At the time, she also had a nonproductive cough, generalized weakness and one episode of loose stool.  She presented to the emergency room on 3/7/21 with significant hypoxia.  She tested positive for COVID 19 by both rapid test and PCR.  A quantitative test for COVID antibodies was sent out to a reference lab on 3/7/2021 and resulted on 3/11/2021 as &gt;250 U/mL.  Pt. required CPAP, BiPAP, High Flow Oxygen and ultimately intubation.  Was not oxygen dependent before hospitalization. Pt. treated with dexamethasone, 2 doses of Remdesivir (then held due to acute kidney injury), tocilizumab X 1 dose, 1 unit COVID-19 convalescent plasma.  Pt. expired on 3/19/2021.  Sample sent for genome sequencing to check for variants of interest in joint effort between pathology and infectious disease.  Report not yet available.

She was hospitalized from 19Feb2021 to 21Feb2021. She has seen 3 doctors. One of them recommend a stress test which was done on 2021 and it was ok. She went to the doctor&#39;s office and they thought she had fluid, but it was not there; the neurologist said there was nothing they could do. With regards to treatment for ringing in hears, first, she stated nothing, she did not know what to do. She has gone to 3 doctors and one of them prescribed prednisone but that did not help.

I called 911, and when the paramedics came, her blood pressure was very low and she was sweating heavily.  She was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up.  She had a similar episode 10 days earlier while having a bowel movement (and also experience diarrhea at that time).  She was taken to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 2 days where testing was done.

She said she was really hurting, clarifying she had both joint and muscle pain. Every time patient moved she was crying and screaming from the pain. Her blood pressure had dropped. Patient said she knows her blood pressure gets very high with pain. Patient blood pressure medications can drop her blood pressure too fast, and too low. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: her blood pressure was dropped to 116/69 mmhg, which was pretty low for her. She said last night when she had checked her blood pressure it was 180/90 mmhg. Patient was walking really funny, and hoped she did not fall.

Her daughter (me!) visited and immediately called her pulmonologist who requested she immediately go to the hospital.  The ER said she had an enlarged heart, and was checked in to the cardiac unit.  Tests showed she had acute systolic and diastolic heart failure.  She was first put on diuretics while further tests were done, and Tikosyn was later added to her list of regular medications.  Within a week she was able to go home.  She was on oxygen prior to this event from the pulmonary fibrosis, and was able to return to her prior settings on her oxygen concentrator within five days, but her ongoing discomfort has stayed at a heightened level, and her level of activity has not returned to her normal.  Please note:  she is an 84 year old with pulmonary fibrosis.  It is not possible for me as her daughter (not a medical professional) to know if the original diagnosis of heart inflammation was related to her vaccination, but she had been relatively stable for more than six months prior to this hospitalization event and the onset of this sequence of events was identified by the doctors as being of unknown origin at that time.

A non-pregnant 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 13Apr2021 (at the age of 84-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidaemia (HLD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM2). Concomitant medications included regular prescribed medications for HTN, HLD, DM2 (drugs unspecified). No other vaccines prior to four weeks. Known allergies were unknown. No COVID prior to vaccination. Covid test post vaccination in May2021 was negative. The patient had no acute issues prior to her 1st COVID vaccine. In Apr2021, the started experiencing progressive weakness and poor appetite to the point of hardly being able to walk. The patient saw her primary doctor who ran some blood work and noticed she was dehydrated with mild elevated liver enzymes and WBC count. The patient was admitted to the hospital (for 21 days) for IV fluids and was on oral antibiotics. The patient started having some SOB and scans done indicated possible lung infection. The patient was switched to IV meropenem which did not help. The doctors also noted some lesions on her liver and a small mass in her lung (no biopsy was done cause she declined) which they said were suspicious for cancer. The patient then suffered a large ischemic stroke and she passed about a week later. The patient was feeling well before her vaccine and everything started to go downhill after her vaccine. AEs result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent covid test: negative in May2021. The outcome of events weakness, decreased appetite, unable to walk, dehydration, elevated liver enzymes, white blood cell count increased, short of breath, lung infection, hepatic lesion, lung mass, and lung cancer was unknown. The patient died on 27May2021 due to ischemic stroke and infection. An autopsy was not performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information  and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported suspicion on malignancy and BNT162B2 use is  unrelated while the causal relationship between the remaining events and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. There is limited information available which precludes a more meaningful assessment. However, the underlying conditions and the age of the patient maybe risk factors.

An 85-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# ELO140, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm (deltoid; unknown side) on 23Dec2020 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2017 and ongoing, high blood pressure from 2017 and ongoing, atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) from 2019 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was administered first dose of the COVID vaccine on 23Dec2020 and then was swabbed for COVID on 26Dec2020, and then on 28Dec2020 her PCR swab was positive for COVID. She was asymptomatic until she started complaining of leg pain. She ordered an ultrasound for the patient on 30Dec2020, and it confirmed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in left leg. The patient was being treated with anticoagulant apixaban (ELIQUIS) currently. Caller stated that this could be that it (DVT) is from COVID, but her real question was, could it be from the vaccine? In Pfizer&#39;s information packet for patients, there is section on what to tell your provider prior to getting vaccinated. One of the things on there is if you have a bleeding disorder or are on an anticoagulant. There is no explanation as to why it was in the packet of information. Caller has looked everywhere and can not figure out why that is on the FAQ/packet information. The patient was due for the second dose on 13Jan2020, but she was worried and hesitant to approve it. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (PCR swab): positive on 26Dec2020, ultrasound of the left leg: confirmed DVT on 30Dec2020. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event &#34;COVID test (PCR swab): positive&#34; is related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The event occurred 3 days after vaccination, when vaccine was not expected to achieve the effect.  The event DVT of legs is not considered related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The patient had underlying diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, which are considered as risk factors for DVT.

She was unable to eat anything and needed to be helped back into bed. Her vital signs were stable (blood pressure slightly elevated) and she has had no complaints or issues since. I do not believe the resident had a bowel movement to coincide with her pain.

                                                I got the vaccine at 8 AM that morning and I was fine until about 5PM and I got very cold. I was freezing. I had a chill.  I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

                                                Palpitation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 85-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in left arm on 27Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included AFib (atrial fibrillation). Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) as blood thinners, had been fine with apixaban, had not got no problem with it; carvedilol (the patient took carvedilol and apixaban before got vaccine and at night of 27Feb2021 when the patient went to bed). Patient got a shot in the afternoon of 27Feb2021, and the night the patient had some palpitations, she was wondering about that because they didn&#39;t ask the patient anything about the heart. The patient did take blood thinners apixaban and carvedilol. The patient&#39;s question was should she get the second shot, well do the first vaccine have the same ingredients as the first? She was just concerned because she had history of AFib. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number was requested.

                                                fainted; passed out and was unconscious; still kind of feel weak; bruise on both knees; fall; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable registered nurse (patient, Retired RN). An 85-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at single dose via an unknown route injection in left arm on 23Jan2021 around 08:15 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high which was controlled with medication, allergic to penicillin and acetylsalicylic acid;ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN).  She had lost weight and shrunk according to when she went to the doctor 2 months ago. No other products were taken. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect; no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine, no events following prior vaccinations. No family medical history relevant to the events. Patient passed out on her way home on 23Jan2021 (unknown time). The event required a visit to Emergency room, but not a Physician office. The event clinical course was as follows: She got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. Patient reported that after being monitored at the vaccination site for 20minutes, she left to go catch the bus and fainted before boarding the bus.  She remembered getting on the bus, but did not remember crossing the street. She passed out and was unconscious. An ambulance was called and they took her back to the hospital where she got the vaccine. She was taken by ambulance back to the ER, stayed for half the day, she received IV fluids, and a brain scan due to her fall. She stated that she still feels kind of weak as of 29Jan2021.  She did not know what time it happened, because she lost her sense of time on that day because she did not remember. When she got to the hospital she woke up and wondered where she was because she did not remember what happened. They got an x-ray of her head to see if she had bumped it, but it was negative. She did have a bruise on both knees. They gave her IV fluids, and kept her there for a little while, then sent her home. She called her doctor the next day, but he was busy, so she talked to the nurse. No treatment was recommended, just said to get a lot of rest. She was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 13Feb2021 and was scared to death. Patient verified that she was not admitted to the hospital. Investigation assessment were performed. They hooked her up to the monitor, did an x-ray and a CT scan while at the hospital on 23Jan2021 which were normal (both fine), and gave her IV fluids. Outcome of fainted, fall, passed out and was unconscious was resolved on 23Jan2021. Outcome of kind of feel weak was not resolved. Outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainted and unconscious cannot be fully excluded.  The underlying history of high blood pressure for this 85 years old patient  might provide an alternative explanation.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; heart rate was erratic, but not as much as yesterday and today.; Her blood sugar is steady in 160s where it is normally lower in the 120s, 130s, and 140s.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 85-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9266; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus, thyroid, ongoing bone strength. Concomitant medications included ongoing insulin lispro (HUMALOG) (over 150 take two units) for Diabetes, ongoing insulin (30 units of insulin) taken for diabetes, ongoing levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) (25mcg one tablet in the morning) taken for thyroid, ongoing Lisinopril (40mg one in the morning) for Blood pressure and ongoing Nifidepine (90 mg two and half hours after lisinopril) for blood pressure abnormal, ongoing Atorvastatin (one 20mg tablet at night), ongoing colecalciferol (D3) (25mcg one in the morning), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12) (1,000mcg time release in the morning), Magnesium oxide at 400mg, ongoing calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (CALTRATE 600&#43;D3) taken for bone strength.  Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (30mcg/0.3mL, lot: EL9265, expiration: 31May2021) on 30Jan2021 at 85 years for Covid-19 immunization. It was reported that, she has not had any problems. She goes to the doctor regularly. She has an apple watch, and she does check her heart. She also walks and tracks her steps. The last two weeks, she has noticed something knew. She has developed atrial fibrillation on an unspecified date in Feb 2021. She was concerned. She will do whatever her doctor suggests. She has read that two of the side effects are blood clots and t cells and a changing heart. She has not had atrial fibrillation in the past. She does check her heart. It was just something she does. She has had heart tests before. They checked her out last year 2020. On an unspecified date in 2020, they did a stress test and everything was fine. Everything was fine until last week. Everything was normal before that. The atrial fibrillation started last week. She decided to wait another week to see what happened. Then yesterday, the atrial fibrillation started again with all sort of swiggles. Her watch shows afib or inconsistency. It has been off the wall yesterday and today. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. The health department put up a screen on their website for people 80 and over so she signed up. She goes to the doctor this Thursday. She has diabetes, but it was under control. She takes insulin and Humalog for extra coverage. Her blood sugars have steadily been higher than normal. She took her heart rate on and off last week. It was over a couple of days. Her heart rate was erratic, but not as much as yesterday and today on an unspecified date in Feb2021. Her blood sugar was steady in 160s where it was normally lower in the 120s, 130s, and 140s on an unspecified date in Feb2021. The outcome was not recovered for atrial fibrillation, and unknown for erratic heart rate and blood sugar levels increased.    No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

The patient was a passenger in her car. She was found to be responsive but slumped, and lethargic. She is both demented and also non-English speaking. The daughter functioned as a historian and interpreter. She reported the patient was not feeling well on the way to the vaccine and that the drive from home was long. Just prior to the vaccine, the patient had emesis in the vehicle. The vaccine was given. The patient entered the monitoring area and started to report chest tightness. Unfortunately, she was not able to give much more of history at the time of the interview. EMS was summoned and the vehicle was moved to the monitoring area adjacent to the EMS post. The daughter reported that the patient has had a &#34;small heart attack&#34; within the past few months, for which she was hospitalized.

Venous Doppler was a performed on 4/10/21 blood clots found in both lower legs Please note that I attempted several times to report this to Pfizer, I was disconnected once and was on hold for over hour with the same automated message replaying that there were 6 callers ahead of me. There was no option to leave a message for a return call to share what I feel is important safety information.

                                                Blood pressure high; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reported for herself.  A 85-year-old female patient received her second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 12:00, at the age of 85 years, (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had received the first dose of the vaccine on 18Mar2021 from lot EN6207, at the left shoulder. Medical history included hypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diagnosed about 20 years ago. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate (NORVASC) taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported; hydrochlorothiazide, losartan potassium (HYZAAR) taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported; vitamin d3 (VITAMIN D3) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient experienced blood pressure high on 08Apr2021 with outcome of recovering. Prior to receiving the vaccine on 08Apr2021, the caller&#39;s blood pressure was slightly high when she went in that day because she was sent to a guy who was taking the blood pressure. The caller&#39;s blood pressure was 148 before receiving the vaccine. The caller was told to take her medication in the morning instead of the evening the day starting on 08Apr2021. At first the caller thought that her blood pressure was high the night of 08Apr2021 because she was told to change the timing of her blood pressure medication from the evening to the morning. The caller has had constant high blood pressure after the vaccine and she has never had it that high before. Monday morning, 12Apr2021, her blood pressure was in the 200s and was sent to urgent care, she was told to keep doing what she&#39;s doing. This morning the caller&#39;s blood pressure was 195.  The caller increased the dose of norvasc from one tablet to two tablets, on 12Apr2021 because her blood pressure was still high.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: slightly high   on 08Apr2021, prior to receiving the vaccine , blood pressure measurement: 148 on 08Apr2021 before receiving the vaccine, blood pressure measurement: 225 or 230-something on 08Apr2021 on the night, blood pressure measurement: 200 on 12Apr2021 her blood pressure was in the 200s and was sent to urgent care, blood pressure measurement: 195 on 12Apr2021, unspecified investigation: done before she had the first dose but she does not have it with her.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

An 85-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EW0162), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm on 10Apr2021 at the age of 85-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing arthritis and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient reported that she was not taking anything for arthritis, just some Tylenol once in a while over the counter (it was not prescription). The patient was taking an inhaler for COPD. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: ER2613), administered in left upper arm on 20Mar2021 at the age of 85-years-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced bladder infection and viral infection. The patient got the first Pfizer vaccine on 20Mar2021 and was alright for a few days afterwards. Then all of a sudden, she started getting infections on 28Mar2021, 8 days after she had the first vaccine. She got a real bad bladder infection then she went to the doctor and she got medication for that. She was with bladder infection then she came down with the viral infection. The patient reported that she has not even been going anywhere because of the virus and she has been staying home. She just goes to the grocery store and clinic to the doctor, that was it. The patient had an antibiotic for the bladder infection. Sulfamethoxazole was the name of the medication that was for bladder infection. They didn&#39;t give the medication for the viral infection. The patient reported that it was just a viral infection, it was not the Covid. Since then, she had her second dose of the vaccine on 10Apr2021 and from an unspecified date in 2021, her foot started, her foot swelled up and she didn&#39;t know. She takes lot of retention pills, so she thought maybe it was that. So she took her pills and everything and washed and start getting but the next day instead of the foot going down, the swelling went up to her leg and then the next day it went all away up to her hip. The swelling on the left side from the foot all away up to the hip. She went to urgent care on 21Apr2021 (reported as &#34;21st&#34;) and saw a doctor and she was tested and she had blood clots. Regarding lab test, the patient reported she had two infections and then she got the blood clot that was from her hip all the way down to her left leg to her ankle. She could not figure out that they called the test and what they tested. But they had a lab work done then one has a test, veins, and everything. She can&#39;t remember. The patient reported that her foot and her leg was swelled, her toes all over up to her leg swelled. She had a fat foot and a fat leg just one side. She would say since she has started taking medicines for that, she took the first dose at the evening of 21st (21Apr2021), the day she went to the urgent care, and she would say it was not any worse. The medication was supposed to break up the blood clot, but it was the big one from her hip all the way down to her foot. Just a little bit better. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Patient is an 86 year old dementia non-verbal patient at the Stadium Place Nursing and Rehabilitation center. She is generally not alert and has a lot of grunting and arm tremors. On January 8, 2021, she received the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination on her right arm. About an hour later, the patient?s aid reports patient having a minor nosebleed. The nursing home facility staff noted that patient does not normally exhibit such symptoms. Of note, Pt is on 4 liters of oxygen around the clock and has a nasal cannula inserted in her nostrils. Nursing staff believes this nosebleed is possibly related to the covid 19 vaccine. In addition, nursing staff also attempted to take patient blood pressure but due to constant movements and tremors the reading could not be done. She was monitored for next few hours and no other symptoms has presented.

An 86-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib), gastrooesophageal reflux disease (Reflux), macular degeneration, ongoing It&#39;s for heart, ongoing bleeding disorder. Concomitant medication included metoprolol for heart; ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION) for macular degeneration; fish oil for Omega 3; Vitamins. Clinical course: She had a bleeding disorder, she was on a blood thinner (unspecified medication), they didn&#39;t know she took a blood thinner. She had noticed with her heartbeat seems to be a little erratic, but she also had AFib. So, it seems like she had 2-3 good beats and then kind of has like 2 or 3 slower beats, missing beats, they are not as strong. But she thought that would have been AFib but seems to be a little bit different. It woke her last night, at 3 o&#39; clock this morning on 01Jan2021. She wanted to know if it would have an effect on her heartbeat by taking the blood thinner. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

After the vaccine, she had no new symptoms or signs of vaccine reaction and MD friend reports that he checked her pulse which was not elevated from baseline. On 1/16,  she awakened and continued to feel at her recent baseline. However, in the early afternoon, she complained of  headache, nausea/epigastric pain, and chest heaviness. These apparently were not unusual symptoms for her to feel intermittently.  Per her niece, who has a home O2 sat device, her 02 sat that morning was 97 with a HR of 87 irregularly irregular. She was afebrile. (continue on page 2)

An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 21Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

She got up and had a bowl of cereal. On an unspecified date, the patient also reported numbness in face, legs and slight headache, and need to eat all of a sudden or pass out, and these has gone on for five days now (at time of report). The patient also reported that her lip has a slight droop on left side of her face which was concerning her. The patient reported that after numbness and not eating, she had some ice cream and her whole chest froze up, and it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest felt like ice which never had happened before. It has been an effort to talk, she was really working hard to talk. The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL9262 expiry date 21May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 86 years old) at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL8982) on 22Jan2021 at single dose in upper right arm and on 22Jan2021 experienced severe headache and arm hurting. Relevant medical history includes ongoing compromised immune system diagnosed many years ago, and ongoing one kidney functioning. The patient received no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021 the patient experienced high, over the top blood pressure, delirious incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware which both required hospitalization from 13Feb2021 to 14Feb2021. It was also reported they were concerned about one kidney/ was dehydrated in 13Feb2021. On 13Feb2021 unspecified blood labs showed kidney was extremely dehydrated and Chest X-ray was good. Clinical course was reported as follows: she was just released from hospital yesterday, she took the second Pfizer COVID shot, on 12Feb2021, and became so very very ill, she expected some side effects, the first shot wasn&#39;t bad, the first all she had was a severe headache and arm hurting, but that was 3 weeks ago, and the second one she can&#39;t say how horrible it was: she had to get the paramedics there, she was very very ill. It was the worst night she has had, and she is 86 years old, and has had a multitude of serious issues but that shot was the worst. It was a combination of high blood pressure, over the top, and insomnia like she couldn&#39;t budge and open her eyes, she couldn&#39;t see anything but squares, it was like a horrible, if there is such a thing as a trip, a horrible trip, something she can&#39;t imagine wishing on anyone. The county administered it, she has several doctor, she initially provides her primary care doctor, for consent to contact, but says her nephrologist would be better, as she hasn&#39;t seen her primary care doctor in some time. Her primary care doctor doesn&#39;t know she had this, another doctor gave her permission, her nephrologist. States they were more concerned in the hospital about her kidney, she has one kidney functioning and, on mistake of the hospital, they didn&#39;t connect her to hydration, the night nurse didn&#39;t, and she was dehydrated and it was affecting her kidney. Her husband tried to call Saturday, when she had this reaction at like 06:30/07:00, but there was a huge long wait, he was calling to see about side effects, but they were beyond waiting, had to get the paramedics, her blood pressure was 178/113 and heart rate was 103. First shot was 3 weeks back. It looks like she had it on 22Jan2021, the headache and arm hurting started towards the evening, the shot was taken earlier in the day, and they started in the evening, her headache was quite severe, but with Tylenol it went away, the arm is still sore from the second vaccine, but is slightly better. Clarifies she was hospitalized for the blood pressure and delirium, like, it is best explained, like delirious: incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware, all she could see was, like if she talked about people who did LSD and trips, it was a bad trip, it was squares, she wanted to open her eyes, but could only see squares. She fell asleep Friday night about 11PM, and felt this at 04:00, and she pulled off her sleep apnea mask, she had to run to the restroom, she was weak, feeling like she would slip onto the floor, and had to get right in bed, and the insomnia continued until about 7AM, that was when she started to be able to focus on like words, she was able to say words in her mind, it was like a bad nightmare. She was admitted to the hospital, she was in the emergency room (ER), the paramedics took her there Saturday, about 07:30, took her to the hospital after immediate heart checking, an intravenous (IV) of some kind, and brought her to the hospital and she was in X-rays and what not, they did procedures in the ER, and they suggested her to be observed overnight, they watched her and things started to become more normal, but she is still not clear headed, she is woozy, like foggy. High, over the top blood pressure outcome: It has been back to a good blood pressure. Insomnia is ok- she slept ok last night. What is left: the night she woke up, so early Sunday morning, in the hospital, she was profusely sweating like someone came to her room and showered her bed with water, her sheets and blankets were soaked and this morning she woke, she got up, was still very woozy, and asked her husband to help get her out of bed, and she changed her nightgown and after an hour she got in the shower, as she was sweating again, not sweating, but occasionally on and off chills, she is taking off her nightshirt and putting on a bed jacket, she gets warm and cold, hot and cold. She had blood labs a chest X-ray, heart monitor the whole time until she was discharged, and everything was good except the kidney was extremely dehydrated. This was all on Saturday as well. On her first visit to get the vaccine, at that time, the facility was a big mall, and they handed her what to look for after the injection, and she didn&#39;t notice until this morning, it says if you have an immune system that is compromised, it could affect it, and she has immune system that is compromised diagnosed many years ago. Over the top blood pressure and insomnia had resolved, arm sore was resolving, dehydrated and affecting kidney had not resolved, final outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ET7534), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (at the age of 86years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, blood pressure high, multiple sclerosis, and wheelchair user; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing baclofen (10mg, three times a day), metformin (750 mg, twice a day), amlodipine besilate (10mg, once a day), losartan (50 mg, once a day), magnesium (two times a day), metoprolol (50 mg, 3x/day), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12), and glimepiride (takes 1mg in one meal and as another meal she takes half of a mg); and Statin (unspecified) 10 mg, once a day; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine on 18Mar2021 and she did fine but an hour later when she got home, the reporter tried to help her up off of her wheelchair onto another chair and she could not stand. She had extreme weakness and then she felt like her throat was, like somebody was choking her, like their hands around her throat and then her jaw felt like it was getting huge. Then, her blood pressure went up to 170, the patient was given lots of continuous water and blood pressure pill. She started to feel better after that. The reporter further stated, &#34;She has had various different problems. I do not know if it is allergies or what from what she already has but she did have a lot of it and exhausting stuff afterwards. There is mainly that choking feeling that is frightening that she had one hour after&#34;. It was also reported that the patient developed some rash on her back and hives on her legs. It was not right away. It was kind of a day or two after. The outcome of events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts needed. Further information is expected.

An 86-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed in 1971 (reported as 50 years ago) and ongoing; type 2 diabetes in 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) which resolved in 2019 (about 2 years ago) after the patient lost some weight; she had an episode of A-Fib in 2019 when her potassium was low (lower than the current hospitalization), once the potassium was corrected, her A-Fib resolved. The physician stated that patient has shrunk and was now about 5 foot 2 inches. Clarified that this has not recently occurred since the vaccine; stated it was happening just with age. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any issues with the first dose of the vaccine. She received her second vaccine dose on 24Mar2021. The physician spoke with the patient on Friday, 26Mar2021, and the patient was fine. On Saturday, 27Mar2021, the patient had an episode of diarrhea, vomiting and was weak. The lady cleaning the patient&#39;s house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient&#39;s son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her. Since the reporter was a physician, she knew which questions to ask the patient and saw that she still had some problems. The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient&#39;s potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021. The clots must have come from the heart valves since the carotid studies were fine and if the clots had been in her legs, they would&#39;ve gone to her lungs not to her brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: negative, potassium: low, carotid studies: fine, MRI of the head: multiple small emboli in brain, all on Mar2021; and potassium: low, height: 5 foot 2 inches (shrunk), and weight: lost, all on an unspecified date. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness and fall required emergency room visit. The outcome of the event difficult walking was recovering and unknown for all other events. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fall, potassium low, cerebral embolism, thrombosis, and &#34;potassium dropped and she went into A-Fib and threw clots&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and being life threatening; and the events aphasia and gait disturbance were assessed as serious due to hospitalization. All other events were non-serious. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 until 02Apr2021.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

This 86 years old female patient received the second single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6203) on 04Mar2021 at 11:00, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 vaccine intramuscular, on 11Feb2021 at 18:30 (lot EN6201). The patient received some years ago an unspecified pneumonia vaccine and an unspecified tetanus vaccine experiencing after both headache, swollen arm and rash. She didn&#39;t react to the flu vaccine. Her body didn&#39;t want any more vaccine. Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, maybe a week or two after the second vaccination, early to mid afternoon, the patient had what felt like a charley horse in her lower leg while walking, but didn&#39;t pay any attention to it, just put ice on the leg. She then got sciatica in her leg on 24Apr2021 and couldn&#39;t walk; that was what sent her to the hospital as it was getting worse and she went to the hospital because of the pain. She just ignored it for at least a week but she was still having pain after the second week and could hardly walk due to the sciatica in that leg. At the hospital they found she had a blood clot in the calf of her leg on 28Apr2021. She was hospitalized from 28Apr2021 to 02May2021. The doctors in the hospital recommended that she should report her experience even though they didn&#39;t know if it was due to the COVID vaccine due to the proximity. The hospital doctors took care of her but her primary care provider knew that she had been in the hospital. The doctors gave her medications in the hospital that helped the pain in her foot and the sciatica but her lower leg/calf still hurt so they decided to do an ultrasound and found a blood clot. The patient still had to give herself injections in the belly for blood thinner to treat the blood clot. The patient also experienced soreness in arm on an unspecified date in 2021. Sciatica required ER visit. Blood clot was resolving. The other events outcome was unknown. The doctor said that there was a possibility that the blood clot could be related to the COVID vaccine, but it may not be related at all.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, including a prolonged onset latency of nearly two months, it appears unlikely that BNT162B2 contributed to the reported events. These are likely intercurrent medical conditions in this elderly patient. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) :PFIZER INC-2021501847 same patient/drug, different vaccine dose/AE

She described her vision going black. She said that she did not eat today at her normal times which could have contributed to the event. She is asking if the vaccine could have had anything to do with this?  She has not had a previous episode like this before. She did have some minor injection site pain at the time of the vaccine but that has subsided.  Follow-up call with patient on 1/30/31 at 19:37: Spoke to the patient. She is feeling better today.  She did not see her doctor or go to the ED. She checked her glucose yesterday and it was high. She said she thinks her symptoms were from not eating her normal meals around the time of the vaccine.

Per patient&#39;s wife/caregiver, patient appeared anxious, skin color appeared abnormal, and pulse was weak and bradycardic (not unusual for patient). Albuterol nebulizer treatment attempted but patient was too anxious to complete. Gave 2 puffs albuterol oral inhaler, and repeated treatment 15 min later followed by a small glass of cola. About 30min later patient calmed, no longer short of breath and pulse strong but face remained flushed. Vitals at 9:20pm included BP 116/47, pulse 67. Following day patient had multiple involuntary diarrheal stools. Symptoms reported to provider 2/8 and noted to be resolved.

An 87-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E1 1283), via an unspecified route of administration injected into right arm on 12Jan2021 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history included vertigo (she hasn&#39;t had vertigo in the last ten years, she did not remember when the first time had it, it was years ago), congestive heart failure (CHF, diagnosed a little over a year ago), diabetes (diagnosed about 10-15 years ago, her A1C is always good, she has good control over that), and she got a pneumonia thing but not recently in the last 6-8 weeks. No further details provided about unspecified pneumonia thing. There was no concomitant medications, also she has no other recent vaccinations or started no new medications. Patient reported that she had been having challenges with her blood pressure going up after receiving first Pfizer COVID vaccination. Her appointment of 1st dose was at 13:45, she probably got it close to 14:00, she was out of there by 14:15-14:30. Patient reported that ever since she had the shot, her blood pressure continued to go up, so she would like to ask if she should get a second dose. She takes her blood pressure every morning since she was diagnosed with CHF and they advised her to take that every day and weigh herself to make sure she is not getting fluid build up. Patient said that on 16Jan2021 when her blood pressure was 169/91 she woke up very dizzy and thought she was coming down with a vertigo attack, which she usually has had in the past that when she had attacks her blood pressure doesn&#39;t go up, so she realized her pressure was causing her to feel dizzy. She took it later on in the day and it was 157/84. She looked back and every day it had gone up, and it fluctuated. She says on the time of reporting (on the 25th), it was 160/90. She is scheduled/due to get her second dose of the vaccine on 02Feb2021, and she could contact her doctor for her question. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: 136/69 on 30Dec2020, 134/86 on 31Dec2020, 132/76 on 02Jan2021, 138/73 on 04Jan2021, 133/68 on 10Jan2021, 142/72 on 11Jan2021, 149/75 on 12Jan2021, 150/81 on 13Jan2021, 156/86 on 14Jan2021, 146/77 on 15Jan2021, 169/91 on 16Jan2021, 157/84 on 16Jan2021, 160/90 on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Patient reported dizziness and a fainting episode the morning after her immunization. She knew she was getting dizzy and she attempted to get into her recliner, but fell into her recliner and injured her rib and possibly her &#39;tailbone&#39;. She went to the Emergency Department  where she was examined and scans were taken of her ribs. She was determined to have &#39;bruised&#39; ribs and sent home with advice to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen alternately every 4 hours for pain relief. She has been at home since this episode. We only found out about this adverse event this week when we called her to confirm her second immunization. She reported this fall to us and was reluctant to get the second shot. I reported the event to her provider, and now to you at VAERS.

She was taken to the emergency room to make sure she was not having a heart attack.  She was cleared of any heart problems.  I took her to the doctor on Tuesday and the doctor said it was possible it was a side effect from the shot.  The pains eventually went away.

                                                Patient received the injection on May 2nd.  Following the injection, we noticed an increased weakness and general achiness.  On the  8th she was so weak that we purchased a gait belt to assist her.  We were not super concerned as we were expecting the second shot to cause body aches or flu like symptoms based on what we had heard from others who had received both vaccine shots.  She continued to be unsteady and we found that she has a mild UTI which we had begun treating with prescribed antibiotics. Late afternoon on the 11th, mother suffered a major stroke.  we did not take her to the hospital because we had already been told that they would not be able to do anything at her age should she suffer a stroke.  On the 12th I called the doctors office and asked for them to send Hospice to the house as we could tell that she was dying.  Mother died on the 13th.    Just a week prior to her death I had spoken with Dr. and we had discussed how that she was declining in health but that she was not even close to needing Hospice, yet she is dead a week later.  Less than 2 weeks after getting her second Covid Shot.

                                                On Tuesday, March 9th, a friend of mine went to my mother&#39;s home to take her to a scheduled dentist appointment. Upon arrival, she observed that my mother was disoriented and her vision was impaired. Specifically, her right pupil was completely off to the right side, her eye was irritated and slightly swollen. Per recommendation from the primary care office, my mother was taken to the emergency room. She remained hospitalized for two weeks during which time, several labs and x-rays were performed; several ideas surfaced regarding root cause including Miller Fisher Syndrome, mini-stroke, etc. but no final diagnosis was identified.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 07:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, bypass in 2010, hearing is very bad on the phone, arthritis pain, headache, and blood thinner. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included metoprolol for hypertension, quinapril for hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) for hypertension, ascorbic acid/ calcium/ minerals NOS/ retinol/ tocopheryl acetate/ vitamin B NOS/ vitamins NOS/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER), calcium carbonate (CALTRATE), atorvastatin, warfarin as blood thinner, spironolactone, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) for arthritis pain and headache; all were ongoing. The patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and had reactions to the vaccine or something else. That day, the patient&#39;s left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain), but that was expected, and it went away within 2 days (initially didn&#39;t report it because it was expected). Yesterday (18Jan2021), the patient experienced dizziness and pain in the lower extremities. Last night (18Jan2021; about 6 days after the injection), the patient woke up, felt poorly, and was very dizzy (feeling of dizziness), then, later on, had pain in both lower extremities. The patient took her blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly with result of 159. The patient&#39;s heart rate, temperature, and pulse oximetry were okay on 18Jan2021. She then walked to the bathroom, came back, and went back into bed. The second time she said her legs hurt but this morning she is feeling better than she was. Today (19Jan2021), the pain in feet is better, and the dizziness is gone. Pulse oximetry and temperature were okay this morning (19Jan2021). The patient was wondering if these effects could be related to the vaccine, since the dose was received 6 days ago. The patient was not sure if could possibly be related to the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was that she spent a lot of time doing paperwork on the computer yesterday (18Jan2021) and perhaps that caused some of the symptoms. The patient&#39;s sister called to ask if Pfizer has heard of any late adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccine like this patient&#39;s, 6 days later. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 04Feb2021 (day 22) and her sister asked what if it&#39;s not available. The patient&#39;s sister was concerned about interval and potentially being unable to gain access to the second dose due to supply issues.

A 88-Years-old white female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9266, expiration date: 31 May 2021), via intramuscularly in left arm on 14Feb2021 at a dose of 0.3ml as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s history included allergies to Penicillin, Cortisone, and she thinks also to Lidocaine, maybe. The patient did not have any NDC numbers, Lot numbers or expiry to provide for any of these products, as it was years ago. The patient did not receive any other medications. On 14Feb2021 about an hour after she got her vaccine; the patient had waited 40 minutes after getting the vaccine shot, and nothing happened, so she left, and while she was on her way home, she got a sensation in her nose, throat and upper chest like it was warm, and there was dryness. The patient previously used to get allergy shots because she was allergic to horse flies, and within 24 hours of being bitten, she would have hives the size of dinner plates. The patient went through allergy shots for 10 years and then she moved away and was no longer near water, so she did not think she needed the shots anymore. The patient had been getting the shots for 10 years, she would start to get where her lips felt funny and stuff after getting the shot, and her reaction to the COVID vaccine, felt similar to that, but it had dissipated within a half hour. This was probably respiratory and was not major, her nose did not close up, but it did get dry. The event resolved within an hour. The patient inquired with three physicians about if she should get the COVID vaccine, because she had an anaphylactic experience 40 years ago, before she was going to the allergist, and she had to go to the ER (emergency room), and they gave her whatever they did, Epinephrine or whatever it was, but that experience felt like she was being blown up like a straw was in her body. The patient inquired with these different physicians about told them about her experience from years ago, and what their suggestion would be, and they told the patient to go for it with getting the COVID vaccine, because it anything were to happen, it would be within 15 minutes of getting the shot, but the patient&#39;s was more than 15 minutes after getting it. The patient got the hives to the horse flies, it was usually within 24 hours. The patient did take an EPIPen with her when she went to get the COVID vaccine, because she was concerned she would have a reaction, but did not end up needing to use it. The outcome of the events was recovered.

The fatigue is their primary concern, as this is so profound she will fall asleep on the toilet or even in the middle of getting dressed.  Appetite is decreased, but she denies N/V/D.  She feels &#34;chilled&#34;, but no known fevers, no rigors/sweats.  Cough is occasionally productive of sputum, mostly clear but sometimes with small &#34;chunks&#34;; no hemoptysis.  No LE edema.  No HA or changes in taste/smell.  No known sick contacts, but patient has exposure to multiple daughters who help care for her, and she has been attending church recently.  Urine is dark/strong, but she denies dysuria.   Pt has received both doses of COVID-19 vaccine, second dose on 3/17/21.   Hospital Course:    Patient was admitted to medical floor for COVID-19 infection and urinary tract infection.  Patient had a very mild course of illness.  Decadron was started but patient did not require any remdesivir.  Patient has remained at her seen home oxygen requirement.  Patient was seen by PT and OT services for generalized weakness.  Blood cultures have been negative.  Patient is medically stable for discharge home today.  She will need another 2 days of antibiotics treatment for urinary tract infection.  Since her respiratory status has been very stable, we have chosen to discontinue the use of Decadron upon discharge to avoid any changes in mental status induced by steroids in an elderly patient.  Home health services and remote monitoring kit have been ordered at the time of discharge.   I have called patient&#39;s daughter  to provide update that patient is coming home today and answered her questions

An 89-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number and expiration date unknown, first dose, intramuscular on 26Jan2021 at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mastectomy, surgery for metaplastic carcinoma. She received 4 units of blood and reacted to the blood and itched from her head to toe and they treated her with prednisone for that. She said that the metaplastic carcinoma was 10 inches big and half of her front was removed. Other medical history and past drugs included allergic to Bactrim, Sulfa drugs, Cortisone, Zocor, Keflex, Macrodantin, Penicillin, Vicodin (took three times and thought she was going to die; coughed for a year and couldn&#39;t even sleep because she developed Pericarditis), Benazepril, Levaquin, Losartan, Niaspan (whole body turned red), Pravastatin. On 07Jan2021, she had an appointment with her doctor who first advised her not to take the vaccine because of all of her allergies but she said there is an antidote if she has a reaction so she said she could take it. She had the first dose of the vaccine on 26Jan2021 and had a bad reaction. She was very dizzy and got sick. They didn&#39;t catch it at the vaccination site because they only had the patients wait 15 minutes. Her drive home takes 10-15 minutes. She thought she couldn&#39;t drive home because of the dizziness. She got a tightness in her chest and started getting so dizzy that she ran into the living room and slept on the sofa because she couldn&#39;t handle it anymore. It was reported that she passed out from about 12:00-15:00. She was completely out. She took a Tylenol right after the shot for dizziness and sick because when she told her healthcare professional about the symptoms, she said to take a Tylenol. She also had shortness of breath on 27Jan2021. This morning (28Jan2021) she had a headache but she was feeling much better. The caller asked if she should get the second dose due to her reaction. The patient stated she has a whole list of allergies that she gave the other agent. The patient stated that she doesn&#39;t think she will take the second shot. She also stated she takes Tylenol after the Flu shot so she doesn&#39;t get so sick. The patient mentioned that her physician does not know about any of this and said that she received the vaccine at a hospital. She said that she only contacted her doctor to notify her that she was dizzy. She was directed to take Tylenol. She said that she did take Tylenol as directed by the people administering the vaccines too and she did get sick. The patient said that it helped a little and she knows that it was not the Tylenol that caused this. She does not want to get the second shot if she gets sick like this. The patient said that the fact sheet said to call 911. The shot did not hurt her at all, and she did not know that she even received it. She said that the person who administered the vaccine was very good. The outcome of the event headache was recovering, dizziness, shortness of breath recovered on 27Jan2021, Tightness in her chest, passed out was recovered on 26Jan2021 and sick was unknown.   Information about Lot/ Batch has been requested.

                                                Patient received second vaccine dose and felt well without significant symptoms in the days following.  Then, on 2/19 she developed epistaxis, brusining, and petechiae.   She had labs drawn by a local provider and platelet count was 7.   (baseline, even on chemotherapy for her AML is in the normal range).   Therefore, she reported to a local health center and a recheck of the platelet count was &lt;3k.     WBC and Hb were within normal range.   No circulating blasts or other evidence of AML.  No recent infections or other exposures.   That center reached out for transfer to our hospital as we initially diagnosed and treated her AML.  I advised dexamethasone 40mg and transfer (they also transfused 5u platelets prior to her departure)  Upon arrival at our center about 12hrs later, platelet count was 210 and on 2 rechecks it has remained in the normal range while continuing dexamethasone 40mg daily.   Bleeding symptoms ceased and she was discharged in stable condition.  She plans to return back to home after discharge with repeat lab testing later this week after stopping steroids.   Chemotherapy to be held at least one extra week to ensure stability.

He called 911 and the firemen helped me sit up.  I was cold and clammy, but could talk and answer all questions.  The firemen said I should be all right and they left.  They said they had had extra calls for the same symptoms.  I went to bed, and my blood pressure was 93/53.  I slept all right.  The next day, yesterday, I was tired but feeling all right with the highest temp of 98.4.  Today, February 25, I am doing better.  I called and left a message for Dr.

On 2/20/21, patient received a first dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine 30 mcg/0.3 mL IM x 1 (lot# EL9261; left arm). Was seen in ED c/o back pain and bruising.  On admission Platelets=3k and Hgb=8.6.  Patient treated for Evans syndrome: ITP and hemolytic anemia. Patient received 1 units platelets, IVIG 55gm IV daily x 2 days, Rituximab 560mg IV weekly x 4 (1 dose given during this admission), dexamethasone 40mg IV x 4 days followed by a prednisone taper. Per hematology, &#34;spontaneous development of warm atuimmune hemolytic anemia as well as ITP is of unclear etiology. No malignancy has been isolated. There are some rare case reorts of ITP from COVID vaccination. Ultimately, we cannot prove whether this is due to the COVID vaccine.&#34;  Patient was counseled to not undergo the second dose of COVID vaccine.

Started approximately 27 hours after vaccine and continued to get worse.  Dr. was consulted and diagnosed Shy-Dragers Syndrome related to Dementia as a possibility.

An 89-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.The patient experienced autoimmune (Coombs positive) hemolytic anemia as well as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura in Mar2021 with outcome of recovered in 2021.  The patient was hospitalized for both events from 2021 to an unknown date. The patient received Prednisone, IVIG as treatment. The events also resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care and considered as Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported autoimmune (Coombs positive) hemolytic anemia as well as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The case will be assessed further upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and investigators, as appropriate.
