This 60-year-old female nurse (Patient) reported that received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was &#39;weird&#39; sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn&#39;t talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence).&#34; Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body&#39;s reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.&#34; Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a &#39;go dated&#39;. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better. I know that I have to take the second dose. But I understand the second round can be worse than the first. Is there anything that they are recommending that I can do may be prior to ease the reaction?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported clinical manifestations including swelling face and head swelled, which was suspected as encephalopathy by the reporting nurse, was probably related to the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), due to temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune were likely the risk factors to the onset of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Swelling was the size of large lemon.  Smaller amount of swelling noticed in right armpit, also.  Vaccinations had both been done in my LEFT arm and greater swelling was in left armpit.  Had fever, chills and headache this same day requiring me to take round the clock doses of Tylenol.  By the following day, fever and chills were gone but swelling of armpit still present.  Swelling is slowly diminishing but still present by day 3, as I send this notification.

Medical history included: ongoing diabetes type 2; ongoing gout; went through menopause 10 years ago (2011). She had pulmonary emboli 3 years ago (2018) and had some scar tissue but not on oxygen though she did get short of breath. No relevant family medical history. The only reactions she has ever had was 15 years ago (2006), she had a CAT scan and experienced hives the next day due to the contrast medium. She thought it had since been changed as she had had it twice since then and was given diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) but experienced nothing again. Concomitant medication included: ongoing dulaglutide (TRULICITY) for diabetes type 2 and ongoing oral medication (unspecified) for gout. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1685) single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 19Dec2020 around 12pm and 2 pm. The patient previously got the flu shot (unspecified) every year, 3 years ago (in 2018) she got the shingles vaccine and had also had the pneumonia vaccine (in 2018) but never experienced anything from those products. The patient previously took allopurinol for pulmonary emboli and had had no reoccurrence. She took warfarin for short of breath. The patient had flushing on 05Jan2021, she was hot and turned red like a cherry. She had an episode where she felt really hot like hot flashes or almost like she was flushed. Her face was red as beet and her arm and hands were red, this lasted about an hour and she took ibuprofen (ADVIL) for it. It seemed to be resolved but had come and gone through the night. She was up checking on her puppies so that was how she noticed. She had taken her temperature and it had been 97.6-98.1 which was normal for her, but she was still getting the hot flashes and flushing. She felt feverish and it was not a rash, she just felt flushed. After the vaccine, the patient reported soreness in the arm on 05Jan2021. The patient was experiencing tingling in hands and feet (mostly in feet) on 05Jan2021 and they feel cold. Tingling started about 45 minutes to an hour after the dose. The first time lasted 3-4 hours and then went away. It came back in the middle of the night for a couple hours and then again this morning. This morning it had been going on for 2-3 hours and was still going on right now; it started about 6:30am-7am. They feel cold but her feet were really cold. She had socks and slippers on, but they didn&#39;t seem to get warm. She went on to explain that her hands and feet have profusion. During this she had checked her pulse ox (oximetry) related to her cold hands and it had been 92-95% (on unknown date) which was good. She had also checked her pedal pulses even though they were cold, and a little they were a little on white side, they blanch although might be a little slow but nothing alarming.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears. She woke up about 3:30 with it. The headache now was all over head from front to back and comes and goes. Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches. After the first one, it took 10 hours for the shivering to start. This time it was very similar. The shivering started about 10 hours later, at 9pm on 11Jan2021.

She has had back pain before. The jaw pain started around 05:00 on 12Jan2021. She felt it in her cheek. It was a little bit better. Nausea started at 11:00 pm on 11Jan2021 and got worse at 03:30 when she got up to go to the bathroom around midnight. She felt like she could vomit and felt better, but she couldn&#39;t. Her thighs were burning at 03:30 on 12Jan2020. It was persistent weak and burning. She can barely walk. The areas that have hurt like when you get the flu, she was having now in the same places, so she thought it was from the shot. Calves were sore in back and felt like a DVT (Deep vein thrombosis), started at 03:30 of 12Jan2021 and was still sore. She said she sound like a hypochondriac. It was in back of calf towards knee. She did not think it was a blood clot. It was feeling better. It was still sore but nothing like it was at 03:30. It is just an odd pain.

Nothing concerning, just more curious. With second vaccine, developed chills within one hour and went to bed. Upon awakening, had headache, nausea, chills, kidney area pain, chest discomfort from irregular heart beat. This resolved for about 18 hours, then started again and lasted for 1 week. Chest pain became sharp at times  spreading to arm with mild shortness of breath. Having had a full heart workup last year, did not pursue tests. wanted to see if would pass on it&#39;s own. After one week, only have occasional chest discomfort. Arrhythmia has returned to baseline occasional PVC. No further chills, headache, nausea or other pains.

A 60-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the upper left arm on 12Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient reported that she took it yesterday and an hour into it she started having a burning sensation in her chest. What happen next, around 8pm, she started having allergy like symptoms that lasted throughout the night. She was experiencing nose running, congested and blockage in her nose, and shortness of breath. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. For treatment, she took Mucinex tablets for allergy. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. This was the first dose, her second dose is due on 02Feb2020 and she wants to know if she can skip it.   Before she got it she contacted her primary care due to having allergies before the vaccine and asked if she should take; she was told to hold on but then she went ahead and took it. Within the first 30 minutes she was ok but in an hour is when she had the burning sensation in her chest. The burning sensation lasted about an hour. The dose was administered around 4pm on 12Jan2021.The caller reports that the Mucinex and she has breathing treatment, nebulizer treatments for her lungs, that she did and these things helped. Early this morning she felt she can now close her mouth and breathe normally. It was administered in the upper left arm. She did not require a visit to the doctor or ER. The patient has had no reactions to vaccines in the past nor were any administered on the day of or within the prior 4 weeks. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of allergy like symptoms, congested and blockage in her nose and shortness of breath which included Mucinex. The patient recovered from burning sensation in her chest on 12Jan2021, from allergy like symptoms/allergy and shortness of breath on 13Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Woke up during the night with chills that had my body shivering and a headache.  Did  not get up until morning because I didn&#39;t want to get out of the covers even though I was cold.  Took some ibuprofen which helped with both the chills and headache.  I had no energy and was very tired.  I slept most of the day and woke up to go to the bathroom and take more ibuprofen.  Towards the evening I could tell that I was feeling a bit better.  I was able to take a bath, more ibuprofen and went to bed.  Slept pretty well.  Woke up once and took ibuprofen because of headache and body aches.  Felt much better on Sunday.  Was still tired and slept a good part of the day.  My arm continues to ache, but is not really painful unless I try to lift it.

Thursday night I woke up in the middle of the night to the feeling of not being able to breathe. I laid awake for a while but dosed back off and it happened again a little later.   It felt as if someone was sitting on my chest which prompted me to go to the ER the next day.  Various test were done and I was admitted in the hospital for further observation. After admission I developed a massive headache which lasted from that Friday afternoon until that Sunday.  I was released on that Sat and the symptoms seemed to be getting better and by that Sunday evening all symptoms had subsided.

                                                pain in her whole arm; numbness in right cheek/numbness in arm/hand; Swollen lymph nodes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 12:12 at SINGLE DOSE at right arm for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included SVT this was recognized at least 20 years ago, around the age of 30, she started to deal with high blood pressure, allergic to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took codeine, levothyroxine: allergic to codeine, levothyroxine. The patient also previously took Tylenol with Codeine and that was horrible and she can&#39;t ever take it again, when she was around the age of 40 years old. The patient received the COVID vaccination around Wednesday 30Dec2020 at 12:12 p.m. She was perfectly fine until late Thursday afternoon 31Dec2020, around 3:30-4:00 pm. She started to have swollen lymph nodes. It was only a little bad at first and then she started getting more and more swelling. She spoke with her facility&#39;s RN who suggested she use some cold and warm packs/compresses and also take some Tylenol to deal with it. She has had the swelling for this many days now. It&#39;s not bad swelling but she her lymph nodes are still so swollen. She thought it was a regular reaction, but now it&#39;s been too long. Her lymph nodes are not swollen humongous. There is no redness. Her lymph nodes are not hard, just swollen. The swelling was a little bit better on Friday and Saturday but yesterday, it started bothering her again. She has had pain in her whole arm on an unspecified date. On 03Jan2020, her face also started to feel funny. She clarifies by &#34;feeling funny&#34;, she meant she started to experience numbness in her right cheek, only her cheek, like when one gets a vaccination when they go to a doctor&#39;s office/dentist office and it starts working and one can feel it getting numb. She also experienced numbness in her arm. She clarifies when she puts pressure on her arm (like putting her arm on the desk), she feels numb in her hand. She verifies the numbness in both her cheek and arm started occurring on 03Jan2020 around 7-8pm. She is fine today and then she&#39;ll start to feel the numbness again in her cheek and arm. She clarifies the numbness comes and goes. It comes in the morning and then goes away and then the numbness starts again. She started to feel numb in her face and cheek, like when one gets a Novocain at the dentist office and it starts working- it&#39;s like the same feeling. The outcome of the events Swollen lymph nodes and numbness in right cheek/numbness in arm/hand was not recovered, while unknown for the other event.   Information on the lot/Batch number has been requested.

I fell forward and sustained bruising to my right cheek and temple.  I will be reporting another report regarding the second dose with adverse reaction that is the same but required EMS and Emergency Room visit. Approximately 3 hours after injection I was getting ready for bed (as I work nights). I was talking with my daughter and I stood up and remember waking up on the floor. Bruising to the right cheek and temple. I did not seek medical attention and went to bed. I had no further episode but remained dizzy for several days.

Began to develop difficulty swallowing by the time I reached my car.  Waited a few minutes and it did not abate and continued worsen,. Went to hospital&#39;s ER and was seen by Dr. At that time, my voice had become coarse and gravely. Was given oral steroid and a Benadryl.  Symptoms lessened a bit and were gone after about 2 hours. While at first I thought my breathing wasn&#39;t affected, after symptoms cleared, I realized that my breathing was easier. Symptoms did not reoccur.

At 1208 on 1/20/2021 pt received 2nd dose of COVID Pfizer vaccine. Immediately after vaccination, pt experienced unusual taste in mouth, flushing, and feeling of heat in chest.  At 1232, pt noticed flushing on arms and feelings of heat and pins and needles in both arms, hands, chest, both feet, and back. Sensation was persistent, so at 1301, 50 mg of IM Benadryl administered to RD by NP. By 1320 flushing on arms and chest subsided, feeling of pins and needles persisted but was not as severe as initial reaction. By 1345 flushing on arms returned, pins and needles sensation worsened again in all locations noted prior, spread to scalp, and tingling sensation occurred on lips. Pt communicated with Dr advised to stay under observation, but transfer to ED not medically necessary. At 1415, pt was advised to go home with supervision of partner and monitor symptoms from there.

                                                I had an immediate reaction to the covid vaccine within 30 seconds after the injection.  I felt a warm sensation after the vaccine in my deltoid muscle then felt it go up both my ears, around my head.  I then felt the same warm sensation in my abdomen, followed by buzzing of my entire body with light headedness.  I could breath, I could talk, but I had an urgency for others around me to know that I wasn?t feeling well and something was not right.  I asked my colleagues if someone could take me to the ER for monitoring.  They immediately put me in a recliner and elevated my legs.  This did not relieve my symptoms and asked to go to the ER.  I got to the ER and laid on the stretcher with continued increased buzzing sensation especially in my finger tips and arms.  My vital signs were 148/88 and HR 88 (elevated from my normal of 100-120/60-70, HR 60s).  The buzzing turned into a sensation in my arms that rumbled erratically.  I thought something bad was about to happen and that my blood cells would burst. Then I also felt icy cold in my arms and my gut.  Next what happened were teeth chattering shivers.  All these symptoms occurred in a matter of minutes.  They started an IV, drew blood, gave me Benadryl and ran IV fluids.  My vitals did not reflect what I felt inside, but as symptoms let up, my VS returned to normal.  As quickly as the symptoms started, they eventually calmed down and I was able to leave the ER in 1.5 hours to go home. I was very scared.  The ER doctor thought I had a hyperimmune response to the vaccine.

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported event may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.

The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) for COVID-19 immunization on 29Dec2020 and unspecified flu shot last fall, she thinks in Sep or Oct2020, but she has never had problems with those. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient called and said she had reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 12 hours after her second dose and wanted to report it.

She said the Tylenol, the dose was the extra strength, unknown if it was 500 mg, they were capsules. She says she normally doesn&#39;t keep it around, the in-house nurse suggested it so she went and got a sample thing and took a couple doses, she doesn&#39;t have it with her as she is at work and is not at home. She said that the nausea and vomiting subsided after the first day or second day, she had the on and off fever and slept most of the day both days. She said that she doesn&#39;t have a fever now. She said that she doesn&#39;t have her exact heart rate from when she was having the rapid heart rate, she just felt it in her chest. She added that the only reason she said anything was because she called in sick last week on an unspecified date in Jan2021. She said that the rash started developing after that and it is now probably the size of a 16 oz or 60 oz cup, unable to clarify number with caller, she said that it is definitely big but it doesn&#39;t bother her, though she is concerned it is there. She clarified that it is a couple inches in diameter and kind of looks like the state of (State Name), on her injection arm which was her right arm. She said her arm is not sore now, it was after the shot on an unspecified date in Jan2021, if she pressed where the injection was it is still a little sore. She said that the hospital said to report it. She said she also has a concern if she should she get another shot if they decide this is needed for more than two vaccinations. She said that she knows they are still gathering information at this point, so she thought she should better turn in, hopefully there will be solution later on. The outcome of the events localized rash, dizziness, heart rate increased and sickness was unknown. The outcome of the events fever, nausea and vomiting was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021 while the outcome of the event vaccination site pain is recovering.

By Friday, I went to my PCP and they noticed that my blood pressure was only 90/58 and they were concerned so she told me that she was calling my cardiologist who said to reduce the dose of my Diltiazem from 180 mg daily to 120 mg daily. She also said to take a few days off of taking the Diltiazem. I have also had a serious increase in Tachycardia. That evening I went to the ED because I was so weak and couldn&#39;t breath well. I am also retaining a lot of fluid. The lab work indicated an elevated Pro-B-Natriuretic Peptide level of 227. I am still not well and each doctor I have spoken to said they believe it is due to the vaccine. I do not know if I should take the second dose.

                                                I had a stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable Nurse. A 61-years-old female patient received second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number:EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation in hospital. Medical history included hypothyroid. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine, trazodone, famotidine (PEPCID), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12). The patient previously took codeine and experienced drug hypersensitivity. Historical vaccination included BNT162B2(lot number:EL3248) on 12Jan2021, in left arm, first dose. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination. The patient stated I don&#39;t know if it was a result of the Covid shot. But I don&#39;t have any comorbidities and I had a stroke on to four which was two days after the shot on 04Feb2021 09:30 with outcome of recovering (as reported). AE result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization (2 days), disability or permanent damage. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab, Covid test result: negative.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Despite insufficient clinical information provided, by close temporal relationship and absence of factors which may provide an alternative cause, the company deems there is a reasonable possibility that the reported stroke is related to the suspect drug Comirnaty.

                                                I am retired handicap-MS.  I was doing light housework.  I started getting pain in right lung,  over course of 2  hours  pain became very severe.  Only in right lung.   Felt like blood clot or pulmonary embolism (which I had 15 yrs ago).  Went to hospital, check X-ray no clot/embolisms.   Blood work showed no clotting factor.    Was admitted 4 days.  We treated possibility of MS reaction (solu-methyl) as well as heparin in event of unknown clotting issue.    Here?s why this is strange:   If this was MS flare/relapse, I would have muscle lockup, drop foot, sight issues, sever balance issues  ...(i always have sight issues)..   with this even it was only severe lung pain.     Did not appear to be MS driven issue.  Being educated ?high analytic person,  in reflection,  My ms is very territorial,  it fights anesthesia,  colds/flus/covid when my husband had it.   My MS gets cranky when my immune system is attacked.    I suspect the second covid injection was doing its thing,  dna modification, and I had some lung inflammation and my MS compounded the reaction with crippling issue.  I was in hospital 4 days, IV fluids, heparin, and steriod IV.    Within first 36 hours the extreme lung pain disappeared and I got better.  I do have cats scan, mri, X-rays from stay.  Cat scan clear, X-ray, normal,  mri-classic ms history.  Was this Ms event?  I?m not sold as I didn?t have other normal MS flare symptoms.   Was this injection aggreviated?  Perhaps...  I?m sharing this because I think tracking auto immune disease people is important data gathering.  Feel free to call if more dialogue is necessary

At one point it seemed to settle into my hand. Knuckles swelled arthritis like. When walking up stairs I had significant muscle weakness in my legs and exertional  dyspnea.  Eyes felt &#34;feverish&#34; but had no fever. The next morning while trying to do a routine workout the same thing happened. It was a significant change to my normal condition. The dyspnea was the most concerning. The body aches settled into my lower back. Fatigue was moderate-moderately severe.  As the day went on things waxed and waned.

A 62-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT#: GL3248 (Caller said that the G may be an E.)), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at second single dose for working with cancer patients. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and ongoing hyperthyroidism, both diagnosed about 6 years ago and were under control. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 for working with cancer patients (First dose, lot number: EJ1685, injection in the left arm). On 11Jan2021 the patient had chills, joint pain, and lower GI symptoms. Her lower GI symptoms included diarrhea. Then caller clarified that it was not diarrhea but the urge to go. The stools were solid. She also had lots of flatulence. She was also wiped out of energy, around like 2 PM on 11Jan2021 she went up a flight of stairs and was so exhausted. The patient is a nurse. She was in her office that day and had to literally lay on the floor because she was so wiped out of energy. She left work early and went to bed. Then the next day 12Jan2021, she was unable to get out of bed the whole day. She is so sleepy and has no energy. She went to bed last night at 08:30, but is still so sleepy. Today she is feeling better, but still had lower GI symptoms. She was also feeling cold, which she normally is always hot. She was having to put 5 blankets on her. Outcome of the event chills was recovered on 12Jan2021, of events joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed was recovering, of events flatulence and feeling cold was unknown. The reporter considered the event chills, joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed as serious (disability) and related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported chills, joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, given the plausible temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

                                                heart rate of 160; severe nausea; arm soreness; muscle soreness in left arm; general fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 62-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 62 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EK5730) administered on 30Dec2020 at 01:00PM and the patient said she did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. The patient received no concomitant medications. She stated that she had no other recent vaccinations or new medications. One thing that may be important is that she did do a 7 day detox that ended the Sunday before her second vaccine dose, so her body was pretty much having no impurities in it, and she has been eating clean since then, maybe having something foreign put into her body set it off after detox. The patient experienced arm soreness and general fatigue on 21Jan2021, and on 22Jan2021 at 01:00 she experienced severe nausea and heart rate of 160 (which was reported serious as medically significant). Patient reported that after her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine she had a significant side effect that didn&#39;t happen until 10-12 hours after getting the vaccine. She did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. After the second injection her arm was sore, and she had general fatigue. She had the second dose injected Thursday at around 01:00PM, then at one in the morning her heart rate was 160, and she had severe nausea. She was that way until 08:00AM. Her heart rate was 120 probably by 09:00AM, then came down to 100, she has never had anything like that before. Her arm soreness was a deep muscle soreness to her left arm. The fatigue was a couple hours later after she got the second dose of the vaccine. The nausea started at 01:00AM, and lasted until six to eight, she did no treatment, and it improved and is still gone now. For her heart rate of 160, she had no treatment, though she probably should have gone to the hospital, but it came down. She usually runs a heart rate of 60-70, it went back to normal Friday, probably in the afternoon on the 22nd, about 12 hours after that started. The patient stated that she feels this is medically significant for her heart rate to be that high. She had contacted her primary care physician (PCP), but they didn&#39;t call her back for 4-5 hours, by then she was fine. She doesn&#39;t think that this was treated well by her PCP, and that they should have done an electrocardiogram (EKG) and follow up labs, she is changing her PCP as a result of this. She is concerned about the people who will be getting their second dose, she has been helping with these, they have patients that are over 100, they wouldn&#39;t survive that rapid heartbeat. The outcome of arm soreness/muscle soreness and fatigue was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event of heart rate increased was likely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This consumer (patient) reported that a 62-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 62-years, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hadn&#39;t had her period for 8 years. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historically received first single dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 62-years for COVID-19 immunization. Patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine last Friday 19Feb2021, when she was driving home her eyes was runny, sort of hurting like salt in her eye, it was like that all evening she had to put a patch on her eye to help it. That same evening may arm was hurting where she got the vaccine in the right arm, and the lymph node under her arm got inflamed. The next morning on 20Feb2021 when she woke up she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed, but that went away. The armpit swelling has continued since the day of the vaccine. Now this morning in Feb2021 she had a mucus plug and was bleeding she haven&#39;t had her period for 8 years, every two days she had something new. Patient wanted to know what had been woken up in her body. Consumer added that she read on line that patients should wait for 5months before going to their doctor about the swollen lymph nodes because they might send the person for a test, mammogram and it may say they have cancer, in the clinical trials apparently some patients has issues with their lymph nodes and when they did testing it was found they had cancer, but it was not cancer it was the vaccine. Outcome of the event she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed was recovered/resolved in Feb2021; of the armpit swelling was not recovered/not resolved; while of remain was unknown.

                                                No symptoms after the vaccination on the day of or the day after getting the vaccine.  Two days after the vaccine, while at orthopedist (for a Rotator Cuff Surgery), I began to feel dizzy.  I sat down for a few minutes, drank some water, and then resumed my therapy.  After the first set of my 4th exercises I began to get dizzy, I sat down on the PT table, then laid down and fainted for about 1-2 seconds.  My blood pressure plummeted to 60/?. EMT?s and an ambulance were called.  I was given an IV and taken to hospital.  In the ER, my blood pressure elevated to 205/121. (I think that was it.)  I was given a cat scan, ekg, chest X-ray, blood tests, etc.  All tests were normal except a very slight (by one number)  magnesium level.  I was admitted for observation and more tests where performed.  My blood pressure remained high, but I had no more dizziness or syncope.  I was given many more blood tests, imagining, ultrasound of heart, ultrasound of carotid arteries,  ultrasound ?bubble test,? nuclear heart treadmill stress test.  All tests were normal.  The only change in my health that can be attributed to this episode is the Covid vaccine.

Last night at roughly 3:15 am I woke up because I was having difficulties breathing. I had trouble on the inhale but the worse part was not being able to exhale with the CPAP on.  I could only exhale through the mouth. I had to take the CPAP off so as I could breath. I also got out of bed to get in a sitting position.  At this point my breathing seemed somewhat ok.  About 30 minutes later I took my blood pressure and pulse.  BP was 123 over 70 and my pulse was 70.

She already has known CAD and risk factors for CVD.  It is possible, but by no means certain, that the vaccine was an indirect cause of the event.  Since the vaccine provoked an immune response, as it was supposed to, it is possible that this inflammation may have set up a metabolic predisposition that may have contributed to the event, which was 12 days later.

I was so dizzy I couldn&#39;t open my eyes without getting sick. We called ER and explained that we thought I was having a reaction to the vaccine, and their response was they had never heard of that type of reaction. I was sick all night, called my primary Dr in the am and they told me to go to ER. We had to call ambulance to take me there because I was so sick and couldn&#39;t open my eyes without having to vomit. Room spun in circles. My arrival at ER, they did MRI, EKG, blood work. My blood pressure was very high, so they connected me to a heart monitor. I had low Magnesium due to vomiting so much.  I was treated with Valium and anti-vert medication and fluids. I stayed overnight in hospital- had PT Jan 13th  for DX of Vertigo. Then referred to Outpatient PT for Vertigo.  Dr&#39;s felt it was a &#34;coincident&#34; that I got Vertigo shortly after vaccine, and strongly felt it was not related.  . Today is Jan 17th, and I am still dizzy, but feeling better. I have an appointment with my primary Jan 18th and not sure if I should take the 2nd dose. That is the question.

On 09Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, assessed as medically significant and in Jan2021 she experienced earache (she thought it was an earache, but it was more than that, but it made her ear hurt, and she has no infection), her mouth was drawled a little, further detailed as numbness and &#34;the eye, it is messing with it, when she is trying to see out of it, she can see, but it&#39;s blurry like&#34; and, &#34;where the ear thing is&#34;, on the back of the lymph node was real sore and her face was kind of puffy, which is the reason she went to the doctor. The patient had to go to her doctor, he told her she had a reaction to the shot, he called it Bell&#39;s Palsy, and said to let Pfizer know. Her doctor gave her something to take for mouth drawled/numbness, which is supposed to help, and she has to go back in a week. The event Bell&#39;s palsy outcome was unknown at the time of the report.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 24Dec2020 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, ongoing allergies. She was asthmatic and believed that the virus would have affected her differently if she didn&#39;t get the vaccine. If she was to catch the virus and didn&#39;t have the vaccine she may not have come out of it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient denied getting any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. Received the COVID vaccine at her workplace. The patient got COVID virus on 07Jan2021. It was also reported that the patient lost a lot of weight, but still plump, coughing, tightness in chest, upper chest tightness with post nasal drip, like the flu, body aches, all on an unspecified date. Emergency room visit needed for the events (body aches, runny nose). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid PCR testing: negative on 04Jan2021, positive on 07Jan2021, rapid COVID testing: negative on 01Jan2021. The outcome of the event (got COVID virus) was not recovered, of other remain events was unknown.  Clinical course: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Dec2020, and a couple weeks later she got the COVID virus (07Jan2021). Mentioned she lost a lot of weight, but still plump. Probably be in the hospital now. Still had some coughing, tightness in chest, but it&#39;s not as bad. Upper chest tightness with post nasal drip, like the flu, runny nose in throat that goes down into the lungs and when it goes down she coughs and hacks to get rid of it. Went to the doctor office on the 01Jan2021 and did a rapid test and it was negative. Then on 04Jan2021 she did another PCR Covid test and it was negative. On 07Jan2021 she had symptoms and was insistent on getting another test since having body aches, runny nose. Got the re-test and it came back positive when she went to the emergency room. Got the PCR test. The patient thought that the way they were testing is how it&#39;s spreading. Did the testing on the 04Jan2021 and they used a swab bigger than a cue tip, it was huge and couldn&#39;t get far up enough instead of the tiny ones. On the 07Jan2021 at her job, emergency room, they had the tiny ones and was able to go further up and that&#39;s when she tested positive. Mentioned using salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) nebulizer, over the counter cough syrup, prescription azelastine hydrochloride;fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) nasal spray, and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED). When has the dry cough she uses the ALBUTEROL nebulizer with the machine and vials at home and that slows down the coughing a lot and the other stuff with the lungs. Not taking any steroids. Using SUDAFED to stop the runny nose from post nasal drip from going into lungs.

(Patient stated shortness of breath was another symptom that she had from COVID and is continuing somewhat especially when I was a mask for work -  but had not put it in the first report). Chills on Friday morning in the middle of night; woke up and my temp was 101.3 and I was feeling bad all day; had headache and went back to bed. Still have pain in hip/knee and joints and those pains got really bad after the vaccine - increased. Doctor  vist told me to use Ibuprofen to 3 times a day for that pain.  Shortness of breath continues from Covid symptoms and so does the hip/joint pain - it has decreased.

I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

                                                Patient received her vaccine on Thursday, 1/21/21.  From then until Saturday afternoon she had been experiencing extreme fatigue.  On Sat. around 5:00 PM she was standing at her flat-top stove cooking dinner.   A wave of very extreme fatigue came over her, so she leaned over to turn off the burner.  When she did this, she passed out leaning forward with her hand on the burner and touching the frying pan.  When she came to, she went to the couch and laid down - not realizing for 10 minutes that her hand and right breast were burned.   The resulting injuries lead to her having to see her PCP on Monday, and then a General Surgeon on Weds 1/27/21.   Injuries sustained include a second degree burn on her right breast, On the right arm, laterally above the wrist is a small superficial partially healed burn.  On the dorsal aspect of the right fifth finger there is a longitudinal burn that goes from the MCP joint to almost the tip of the finger.  She has limited range of motion due to discomfort and swelling.  The blister encompasses the entire dorsal lateral aspect of the finger. The fourth right finger has a less extensive blistered area on the PIP joint.   The burn on the fifth finger is  deep second degree.

                                                heart start palpitating and racing; kind of warm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 11:00 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization, and potassium chloride ER, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at 10 mg, daily (every day) for low potassium. Medical history included anxiety and was afraid to take her anxiety medicine; hypertension, and iron deficiency; all from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate (NORVASC) for hypertension, and colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]). It was reported that when the patient got the shot it did not hurt but when she sat down for about a minute (26Jan2021), her heart start palpitating, and racing and then she got kind of warm and then it went away. She didn&#39;t pass out, had no shortness of breath. She just wanted to know if it was one of the side effects and that&#39;s why she need to report this. The patient was looking at the ingredients that Pfizer have like potassium and stuff. The patient takes potassium every day. She added that maybe she should have not taken her potassium at the same day, would make your heart raise that&#39;s why she was wondering. Otherwise the patient felt fine. She just needed to report this. Furthermore, patient stated that maybe because she was nervous, she was scared to take certain anxiety medicines (unspecified medications) she did not know would had it though. The outcome of the events was recovered.

A 63-year-old female patient (mom) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Feb2021 (reported as in the first week of Feb2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Reporter (patient&#39;s son) received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday and wanted to know if this vaccine could cause blood clot. He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet. They did test for blood clots, they did an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Feb2021, it was positive for blood clots (blood clots in the lungs). When she was admitted her oxygen was 85%. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot and batch number has been requested.

A 63-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration in Deltoid Left on 19Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Slightly elevated blood pressure from Feb2021 and ongoing, Elevated cholesterol from Feb2021 and ongoing.  Concomitant medication included pravastatin (PRAVASTATIN) from Feb2021 and ongoing for Elevated cholesterol, lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) from Feb2021 and ongoing for Slightly elevated blood pressure.  The patient experienced testing positive for covid infection following administration for the first vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. COVID: Initially reported onset of symptoms as 29Jan2021, but clarified onset of symptoms night of, or morning of 28Jan2021. She always had allergy symptoms like a drippy nose; she was getting ready to go get allergy testing in a few weeks; but on 28Jan2021 she noticed a real increase of sicker drainage all through the night. She thought she might had had a sinus infection. She felt cold and chills but no fever; she never had a fever; but had chills daily. She also had really bad sore throat that went away the next day; and lots of nasal congestion; chest congestion; productive cough. She still had nasal congestion and a little bit of chest congestion but chest congestion was very light in color. She had had no trouble breathing or shortness of breath; other than from her nose being stopped up. Seriousness criteria: Caller reported no emergency room visit, doctor&#39;s office visit or hospitalization related to this event. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Flu test: unknown results on 03Feb2021, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test: positive on 04Feb2021.  The outcome of event sore throat was recovered 1 day later on unspecified date, lots of nasal congestion was not recovered, while for other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 7 days after the second dose. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 24 hours after I got my injection I began to feel cold. I am by nature always cold  but within 30 minutes I began to shiver. This intensified and I got to the point I was shaking hard and so cold. I had also had a headache all day but that is not unusual for me as I frequently have sinus headaches that can last all day. I took my temperature which was 98.3 but I took Tylenol anyway realizing I was likely having a vaccine reaction. I got into bed under my electric blanket. Ninety minutes later I had finally warmed up. In fact my feet and hands felt like they were on fire. I rechecked my temperature and it was up to 100.9. I peeled off my numerous clothing layers and I actually felt better since the chilling had stopped. I ate some dinner and watched TV and went to be around 11pm. I slept fitfully which is normal for me. As the night wore on I began chilling again. I got up sometime around 5am and took more Tylenol. If I remember my temperature was around 100.1. I slept several hours and woke up feeling ?back to normal?.

A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EC1284), via an unspecified route of administration administered to left arm/deltoid on 29Dec2020 13:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a research medical facility; and received warfarin sodium (COUMADIN, strength 2 mg), oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date in 2017 and ongoing at &#34;3 1/2 tablets once daily in the evening at 5:30pm (total 7mg)&#34; for metal heart valve. The patient&#39;s medical history included had the surgery (for her metal heart valve), about 01Mar in 2017 (about 4 years ago) and so she thought she had been on Coumadin for about 4 years, had been on the 7mg dose for over a year; and has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin for the metal heart valve. Denied illness. Denied family medical history relevant to event. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Shingrix vaccine in past and remenbered she had the usual side effects from it, had mild symptoms. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines the same date of the Pfizer Suspect or 4 weeks prior. On Jan2021, the patient experienced scratched arm and bled through 3 shirts, it kept bleeding. On 04Jan2021, her international normalised ratio (INR) was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2). The events did not lead to emergency room visit, however led to physician office visit. The events were reported as serious medically significant. The nurse got the first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 29Dec2020 because she is a healthcare provider. She wanted information on increasing INR. The nurse has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin. Her INR was typically 1.7 to 2.3. She reported her last INR, before the covid-19 vaccine was given, was &#34;some time ago&#34; but it had not varied much over the years. Normally she got her INR run and it was about 2.  She had to be scheduled for her INR on the 04Jan2021 and it was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2) and they asked about anything that may have changed and the only thing was that she got her first shot. The nurse reported not having any changes in her medications, food, or life style to account for the change, other than receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient stated that it could be a serious problem if she had an accident or fell and started bleeding. A normal person&#39;s lab result is between 1 and 2, but they like to keep people with the metal heart valves between 2 and 3. She had been bleeding. She had barely scratched her arm the other day and went through 3 shirts because she kept bleeding. This is more than unusual for her, it&#39;s kind of unusual.  Getting the vaccine is the only variant she has had since getting her last INR. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included INR (normal range 1 to 2): typically 1.7 to 2.3 on an unspecified date; it&#39;s about 2 on an unspecified date: and 5.8 on 04Jan2021. The action taken in response to the events for warfarin sodium was dose not changed. The outcome of the event INR was 5.8 was not recovered, for the other events was unknown. The nurse (patient) assessed the event &#34;INR was 5.8; it&#39;s normally about 2&#34; as related to the COVID-19 vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of International normalised ratio increased and wound hemorrhage due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284; expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration (vaccination location: left arm) on 06Jan2021 09:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as &#39;none&#39;. It was also reported that patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine, and prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID. The patient has no allergies to medications, food, or other products (no known allergies). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EH9899; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (vaccination location: left arm) on 18Dec2020 18:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that patient received second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 at 09:30 am. One hour after the 2nd dose (10:30 am), patient experienced dull occipital headache. Patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL). At 10:45 am, patient felt flushed. The nurse took patient&#39;s vital signs and noted no fever, normal heart rate and respiratory rate. BP elevated 226/97 (reported at 10:30, no unit provided; normal BP: 130&#39;s/80&#39;s). At 12:45, patient was taken to ED. CT scan and lab work were reported as all normal. BP continues to be elevated. Amlodipine (NORVASC) 10 mg was given at 17:00. BP slowly came down. Twenty-four hours later, BP was normal at 137/72 (no unit provided). No additional medication taken. It was reported that patient continues to have dull headache. No arm soreness or other symptoms. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events &#39;BP elevated 226/97&#39; and &#39;felt flushed&#39; was recovering, outcome of the event &#39;dull occipital headache/dull headache&#39; was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and in absence of strong confounding factors, the Company considers the reported event blood pressure increased is possibly related to vaccination with BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 06Jan2021 13:00 on left arm at single dose (Lot # EL1284) for COVID prevention. Medical history included ongoing arthritis in some form probably since 2011 (reported as ten years ago, as of 07Jan2021), ongoing Osteoporosis had it probably at least since five years ago, maybe longer, ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus had it probably since 2016 (reported as five years ago, as of 07Jan2021) High cholesterol this is managed or lowered with medication, and was diagnosed in 2001 (reported as probably 20 years ago, as  of 07Jan2021) her whole family has it. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM at age of 64-year-old on right arm at single dose (Lot # EL0140) for COVID prevention. She says that the first time she got the injection in her right arm, but the second time her right arm was still hurting, which she has arthritis over there also, this time she got the injection in her left arm. She says that the soreness or sharp pain under her left ear could be or not be related. She experienced soreness to arm injection site. She says that the area below her left ear doesn&#39;t feel swollen, it just feels like not a sore throat, but every so often she has a sharp pain, and it could be that she slept on it wrong. She says she was wondering if that goes away fast or is connected, like a possible side effect. The patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine 06Jan2020 13:00 and reported to have a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear on 07Jan2021, sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes. She read that swollen lymph nodes were a side effect and is asking if that area is a lymph node and would that be considered a side effect and is asking how long it will it take before it goes away. She is wondering since side effects said might have lymph node swelling or something. She says in her arm where her shot was given is sore, and also kind of right below her left ear, which she thinks that is where a lymph node is. She says every so often she has a sharp pain there that goes away, and she wanted to know if this could be a part of it, since she is guessing that is where a lymph node is, or wondering it this is something even related that could be a side effect. Treatment included she took Tylenol Rapid Relief Extra Strength a while ago, dose queried but not provided. EXP: Jul2022, LOT: SJA072, this is not on the bottle, it must have been on an outer box which was discarded. Treatments received for the events pain, pain in ear, vaccination site pain and swollen lymph nodes. Outcome of the events were unknown.

A 64-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Batch/lot number: EL1284, Expiry Apr2021, intramuscularly on 30Dec2020 02:15 (Dose 1), right arm as a single dose (age at vaccination 64 years old) for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included allergy (usually in the fall she has allergy problems).  Her age is considered high risk, works in medical profession (Surgical Tech). Concomitant medication included levocetirizine (Walgreen&#39;s generic) 5mg, tablet, by mouth, at night for allergy. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine last 30Dec(2020) and after 2 days (on 01Jan2021) she developed symptoms: Sore arms, severe sore throats, back ache/ back was sore, temperature was up / low grade temp (never high), coughing, body aches. Her back and her legs were sore. Her whole body was achy. It was &#34;like flu-ish kinda.&#34; She also had a headache. She started getting the sore throat and headache on 01Jan2021, and she felt a little cold on 02Jan2021. On 02Jan(2021), her first temperature was 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She states she had everything except for the GI issues. Around 02Jan(2021) or 03Jan(2021), her symptoms were progressively getting worse. She was told to get COVID tested. There were three exposures since Christmas Eve. So, she went and got a rapid COVID test (04Jan2021) and it came back negative. They also sent out a test that day. She was also tested for Strep (04Jan2021) too because her throat was so sore. It was almost like she had like thrush along with it. She states it was almost like a thrush because she had like a white tongue (onset 03Jan2021). Her throat was so sore, but it was a different kind of sore throat compared to a sore throat she has had before. She explains where the nasopharynx was at the top, it&#39;s almost like it was sore from there. It was sore to swallow, it was &#34;a bizarre sore throat.&#34; She clarified she noticed the &#34;thrushy&#34; part of her throat around 03Jan2021. The strep test ended up being negative but she believes she had thrush because she was given medication and the medication was clearing that up. However, she still had the symptoms. Because her symptoms only started a few days before, they thought she should maybe wait a couple of days and if she is not feeling any better, she should be retested (for COVID). She went back again yesterday (07Jan2021). She had another Rapid COVID test and also a flu swab and both tests came back negative. She mentions they also did another COVID test (the send out type) and she should get that back around 1pm to find out the results of that.  They also did a CBC (07Jan2021) and everything was normal. Her white count was at 7. She was waiting for the 3rd COVID test result today (08Jan2021).  She reported that about three days afterwards, she didn&#39;t notice the soreness in /her arm. Her throat has improved. Her fever was down to 98 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday (07Jan2021). She states she was feeling better today (08Jan2021). She commented &#34;the lethargy, though.&#34; She emptied the dishwasher yesterday (07Jan2021) and had to sit down after emptying it. She states her symptoms have her a little worried. She recovered from the sore arms in Jan2021. The patient was recovering from  the severe sore throat, back ache, low grade temp, coughing, body aches/ whole body was achy, believes she had thrush, white tongue, legs were sore, headache, and felt a little cold. The outcome of the event lethargy was not recovered. She was wondering if this was a reaction to the vaccine.

I woke up around 5pm my BP had elevated to 160 (don&#39;t remember diastolic reading) pulse rate normal limits. I informed my spouse of what was happening called 911. At the hospital checked vitals, EKG, CT Scan, Chest X-ray, Blood work and  Potassium was low took 2 Potassium pills. I went back home on 12/31 returned to work did fine that day. On New Years day everything started back again discomfort went back to ER. I felt like force in my chest the doctor collected my information and I was placed on a low dose BP medication until I return to my PCP, cardiologist(stress test). I followed up with PCP via Telehealth about my BP concerns, my dosage was increased to 25 mg and due to my symptoms I was placed on leave from work 2 wks.

A 64-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EJ1685), via intramuscular on 28Dec2020 07:15 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hepatitis C which cleared in 2016, hysterectomy was done in 2004 or 2005, cyst removed from breast long ago, ongoing arthritis in left knee, urinary tract infection was treated in Nov2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She received the first vaccine on 28Dec2020. She did fine that day. She came home and laid down and rested. Her temperature went up to 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit but was resolved that same day/night. Early in the morning on 29Dec2020, around 3:30 a.m., she woke up and had a racing/pounding feeling in her chest. She took her blood pressure and it was 158/86, heart rate (HR) was 83. She felt really funny. She hadn&#39;t been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, so this was high for her. She took her blood pressure again about an hour later and it was 165/95, HR 73. She took it again about an hour later and her blood pressure read 180/98, HR 77. Her heart rate stayed in the normal range, but the force felt really strong. She did go to the emergency room around 5:00 am on 29Dec2020. She told them what she was experiencing and that she had received the COVID-19 vaccine. About the time she got to the hospital, her blood pressure was starting to come down. An EKG was done and they drew bloodwork. Her potassium came back a little low-they didn&#39;t tell her how low or what her level was. She was given 2 potassium tablets which did help. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the potassium she was given. It was given to her at the hospital. She was also given a sheet to monitor her salt intake, which she already does that. She confirmed she was not admitted into the hospital, she was discharged from the Emergency Room. She felt pretty good. She didn&#39;t go to work that Wednesday, 30Dec2020, but she went to work on Thursday, 31Dec2020. On 01Jan2021, the same thing happened to her again. She had elevated blood pressure, forceful beat. She went back to the ER early in the morning, around 5:00 am, on 01Jan2021. Her pulse stayed within normal range, but she had such a forceful beat. She informed them that she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point. They wanted to make sure she wasn&#39;t have a stroke or heart attack, so they did their normal procedures to rule this out. They did 2 EKG&#39;s, 2 sets of labs, Chest X-ray, CAT scan and everything came back normal. She had a discussion with the physician that saw her about what she was experiencing and the physician was asking her about having anxiety. Caller explains she has never really had problems with anxiety before, but she can&#39;t say she hasn&#39;t had it. Being around COVID patients and getting the shot, sometimes anxiety can be there. The physician wanted her to try a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. She was to only to take a half dose by mouth, if her top number (systolic blood pressure) was between 140-160. Caller clarifies when she means half of a dose, the dose equals 12.5mg. She was instructed to take this 12.5mg dose until she saw her PCP. So, she did this and called her PCP and wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment to speak with a provider until the following Wednesday, 06Jan2021. She did a tele visit with her provider and let her know what had happened and that the half of the pill will only bring her top number (systolic blood pressure) to 130&#39;s-140&#39;s. Caller states she was used to her top number (systolic) being maybe in the 120&#39;s, low 130&#39;s. Her doctor increased her dose to 25mg. She was prescribed to take 25mg, tablet, by mouth, once a day. She confirmed she still checks her blood pressure before she takes the medicine. Caller verifies she has 2 bottles, one being the 12.5mg dose and the second being the 25mg dose. With the 12.5mg bottle, she sees refills and the date 05Jan2022. Caller clarifies both bottles are dispensed in pharmacy vials with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date. About a month prior to all of this and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, clarified as Nov2020, she was treated for a UTI. During that time, her blood pressure went up a little and kind of bounced around a little bit, but came back down. Then, she got the COVID-19 shot. She initially felt fine but later on by the time she got a chance to do the tele visit with her PCP, she was telling her about her previous UTI, and the provider put her on Cipro because it seemed like her UTI symptoms were coming back. Caller verifies she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration for the Cipro. She already took of all of that. She went to the ER for the third time on 08Jan2021 because she again felt the forceful beat feeling in her chest. She explained she felt really wiped out and worn down and she was tired. An EKG was done and they did labs. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any results with her at this time. She was taken off of work for a couple of weeks. She is currently getting in contact with a Cardiologist to make sure everything is alright. The cardiologist wants her to have a stress test. The caller states so this is where she is now. She is taking blood pressure medicine and getting set up to do a stress test. Sore arm outcome: Caller confirms she recovered from the arm soreness within that same day. Her arm didn&#39;t stay sore long at all. Racing/pounding in chest: This had improved. It&#39;s not like it was. She still has it a little bit of it now, but she is going to see her cardiologist and do a stress test. The blood pressure medicine has helped some. Elevated blood pressure: Today her blood pressure top number got to 161 and she had to take medication but her blood pressure has improved. Outcome of elevated blood pressure, racing/ pounding in chest was resolving; outcome of forceful beat feeling in her chest, UTI, potassium was a little low, felt really wiped out and worn down/tired, anxiety was unknown; outcome of arm a little bit sore, 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever was resolved on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered in a hospital. The patient has no medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EKS or 5730) on 18Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization and no events were experienced. The patient experienced lymph nodes swelled on the arm and the area are sore/currently there is still soreness with the lymph nodes on 10Jan2021, red splotches on 12Jan2021. It was explained that patient got the second dose on 09Jan2021. She read that the lymph nodes could swell under the arm on the side, the shot was given and it did plus the area were sore, this was on 10Jan2021. On 12Jan2021, in the morning, is when she noticed that in the lymph area and going to the outer breast there are red splotches. It was not tender or warm to the touch and she can tell it will fade on its own but she thought it was weird. It might have been there the day before; she didn&#39;t really look. Currently there was still soreness with the lymph nodes but she would have to press to feel it, she would say that was over. She has a picture if needed of the red splotches. Patient stated that she is healthy for her age. She has no medical conditions or takes no medications. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of the lymph node pain was not recovered while for the other events was unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 14Jan2021 09:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing does not have a thyroid; allergies/intolerance to gluten and dairy, allergies to molds, dust and some seasonal allergies; all ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine from Feb2013 to unspecified date, from unspecified date and ongoing for &#34;does not have a thyroid&#34;. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergic reaction occurred at 13 years of age with unknown cough syrup with codeine, levaquin and experienced allergic reaction occurred probably while she was in her 20s (age in years). She had fallen asleep on the couch about 9:00 pm on 14Jan2021. She woke up about 9:30 pm on 14Jan2021 and had an elevated pulse with chest tightness. She had to go to the emergency room in response to elevated pulse with chest tightness. In the emergency room they were not able to do anything other than hydrate her and all of that but it took about 12-13 more hours for her elevated pulse to come down (15Jan2021). Her biggest question was that she saw where some reactions are fast heart beat but she was kind of surprised at how long after the dose was administered that she had onset of the elevated pulse. She saw Cardiologist 18Jan2021 related to this event and the Cardiologist was a little baffled by the event. She reported event as improved, although she still has a little bit of tightness in her chest which goes in a little bit of phases. The Cardiologist told her to still take the second dose as scheduled of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She did not see her family doctor, she saw the Cardiologist only as referred after emergency room visit. She was not admitted to the hospital; she was treated and kept under observation in the emergency room for about 5.5 hours. She has a stress test scheduled for next week. She is planning to still get the second dose as scheduled of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine but she is a little scared to get it due to this adverse event. She thought the events were related with the vaccine, she had no problem prior to getting the vaccine. On 14Jan2021, pulse was 146 beats per minute which she checked with a pulse oximeter machine she has at home so she knows it is accurate; Chest x-ray: She reported that result of a little atelectasis in lower left lung was a little weird. On 18Jan2021, the EKG result was Normal sinus rhythm but throwing PVCs. She reported she knows her thyroid lab is normal because it was checked in the emergency room during visit starting 14Jan2021. The outcome of the events elevated pulse with chest tightness was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs.

                                                Severe difficulty breathing; difficulty breathing frightened her; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 64 -year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL9262), intramuscular (on the upper left shoulder) on 27Jan2021 09:20 (at the age of 64-year-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism diagnosed about 14 years ago, breast cancer from Dec2017 and ongoing diagnosed in Dec2017, ongoing asthma she was diagnosed with asthma when she was 39 years old, surgery from an unknown date, she had surgery to correct a deviated septum and her asthma got better, she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL). On 27Jan2021 she had the first injection. It was about 14 to 16 hours after the injection that she had severe difficulty breathing. Reported she has asthma. She was a cancer survivor, and she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. The difficulty breathing woke her out of her sleep. She had to call the doctor since she is concerned about her second dose which is scheduled for 17Feb2021. The difficulty breathing frightened her, and it was not an immediate reaction, she had the shot at 9:30 am (clarifies she received the injection at 09:20 am) and between 1 to 2 am in the night, she woke up not able to breathe. She could not use her inhaler since she could not really breathe in. She was obviously able to get some air in since she did not pass out. She contacted her doctor and he will send her a prescription to get an Epipen, so she has it on hand when she gets her second dose. Her doctor does not want her to not get the second dose. States she is concerned about other asthmatics receiving the vaccine and wanted to call and report this. She expected it to happen onsite where she received the injection but it did not. Her doctor asked her if she thought it was an asthma attack and she told her doctor that she has not felt like this in 24 years. Treatment/Outcome: She stepped out into the cold to shrink her airways and then was able to use her inhaler. Reports it was not a 2 hour episode thank god, and within 15 minutes she was able to force an inhaler dose in. Everything is fine. She is a breast cancer survivor and cannot use her right side so she had the injection on her left side in her upper shoulder, she has to wait 5 years to be considered cancer free. Her doctor suggested to use her albuterol inhaler for 4 days in advance of getting the second dose of the vaccine. She would think that would be abusing her albuterol but she will do that since she was instructed to do so by her doctor. She was terrified. She will have an Epipen on hand when she goes to get her second dose.  She understands the symptoms can be worse with the second dose, she is anticipating everything should be fine. The outcome of the event difficulty of breathing was recovered on Jan2021, for the other event was unknown. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations, states she has had everything. No Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks.

She was taken to the emergency room and was diagnosed with pericardial effusion and admitted for treatment that included draining fluid from the sac around her heart.  She was released and then developed the same symptoms again within a week.  She again had pericardial effusion, and was told she had severe emphysema with no prior diagnosis.  She is still hospitalized and is now suffering heart failure with no clear diagnosis as to why, no acceptable plan of treatment, and a prognosis of wait and see.  She has consistently tested negative for Covid19.

Today, on March 19th I am home and slowly improving but still needing to be mostly resting.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 17:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.

Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received the first dose of Pfizer vaccination on Thursday, 17Dec2020 at 5 PM. I began to have an adverse reaction on Friday, 18Dec2020 at 11 PM and then until the Saturday, 19Dec2020 until after dinner I had (Incomplete sentence). You want me to break it down like what the time and what the affect was? Okay 11 PM on Friday 18th my hands swelled up, they were red and they were itchy. I couldn&#39;t get the itching to stop. Hand cream or cold water they finally subsided with cold water and I was able to get sleep. Then I woke up Saturday, 19Dec2020 at 6 AM then was my hands, my feet swollen, red and itchy. Itching was just like, I did not know what to do about it. Used cold water and that rested for about 4 hours. After that stopped I had a rash on my arms, my leg and my abdomen and it just came out of nowhere. It was red like a bubbly rash like a size of pea. You think I looked at I thought what I was going to do. I went I got a cool shower another 4 hours that subsided not completely but enough where it wasn&#39;t scary anymore, it was bearable. Closer to dinner time I had Lymphadenopathy under both arms, red, swollen then I took another 4 to 5 hours to subside. During this I have sore arm that was slightly swollen. The arm was swollen, the shoulder was swollen and the clavicle area was also swollen and that&#39;s my reaction. I work in healthcare and I was just at a point I went to work, I reported the incident and I filed a VARIS report. I talked to my administrator she said I should call Pfizer, let them know. I spoke to my primary doctor, to let him know. I just wanted to report this to someone.&#34;Registered Nurse stated, &#34;My work place. It was offered in &#39;(Name)&#39; hospital (not clarified).&#34; Treatment: Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I took Tylenol. I took it three times and that would have been a &#39;1000 mg&#39; each time (Not clarified).&#34;When probed for the Causality, Registered Nurse stated, &#34;Yes.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

A contactable nurse (patient) reported that a 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 11:00 in left deltoid at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, bilateral thyroidectomy in 2014. Family Medical History: Father died of lung cancer. Mother died of cardiac arrest in 1972. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for bilateral thyroidectomy. The patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 27Dec2020. The adverse events resulted in emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020, COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test: positive on 28Dec2020. Vaccination facility type was hospital. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Received COVID Vaccine on 17Dec2020. Tested positive for COVID in emergency room on 27Dec2020. Tested positive on a COVID PCR test on 28Dec2020. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Caller received the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. Tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020. Is about to get the second dose of COVID Vaccine and would like to know if she should proceed or wait. Since quarantine, she has had no fever. Is slightly short of breath and has a headache. Works in COVID units in a hospital. Wants to make sure she can receive the second dose. Stated she had no adverse reaction to the COVID Vaccine unless an adverse reaction can occur two weeks after. Is attributing the shortness of breath and headache to testing positive for COVID. Shortness of breath and headache only occurred after testing positive for COVID. Reason she went to the hospital is because she lost her sense of smell. She got tested and was positive for COVID. Lost sense of smell, went to Emergency Room, and notified doctor of positive test the following day, 28Dec2020. Clarified she just went to the emergency department to get tested for COVID and then went home. Was called with positive results in an hour. Caller wanted to know when she should proceed with getting her second dose of Covid vaccine. She is supposed to receive her second dose tomorrow. She thought she was going to take second dose when I completely recovered. Caller asked if she waited until the 13th to receive second dose of Covid vaccine, would it be effective. She would feel more comfortable doing that. The outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported COVID-19 based on the known safety profile. However the short duration of 9 days since the vaccine first dose is given it is unlikely patient would have fully developed immunity.

                                                When I signed up for the vaccine, the website said that i was at high risk for the vaccine and would need to wait 15-30 minutes after the injection.  I checked with doctor re: this warning and she felt the vaccine was still beneficial but to do my research and make a decision. I received the vaccine at the Center.  I sat down as instructed. 5 minutes later, something felt off and I removed my protective visor.  A paramedic came over about a minute later and asked if i was ok.  I said that i didn&#39;t feel well.  He said that he was going to get a chair with wheels for me and at that time i must have passed out.  The next thing that i remember was waking up laying on the floor. My husband said that there were 4 paramedics in attendance.  The primary paramedic was telling me that my BP was 72/60.  An ekg was being run, an iv inserted and run full force.  they checked my blood sugar which was fine. The primary paramedic kept talking to me to check my level of consciousness.   I was there for quite a while. Not sure who the paramedics checked with, but they decided that i needed to go via ambulance to the hospital. The paramedics were very concerned that the ambulance go to the back door to pick me up so others getting the vaccine would not be frightened. I was transported to Medical Center for further evaluation. I was there for a few hours and my labwork was normal. EKG and chest xray were completed as well as cardiac monitoring.  I called doctor&#39;s office the next morning to notify her of the event. It was very scary!!!

Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

                                                Diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome; Deep vein thrombosis; Both of her feet were only slightly swollen; Dull minor headache; Off-label use; Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered; Localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as &#34;localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given&#34;. On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown. Her vascular surgeon said he did not believe these events were vaccine related but cannot rule it out; her Primary Care Physician absolutely believed the events were vaccine related.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 07Mar2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy history to a of number of medication and things (I&#39;m prone to allergies). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 07Mar2021, the patient received the first dose and she went to sit in the observation area for 5 minutes. The patient was not anxious at all about getting it but she started having a rapid heart rate/ bounding rapid heart beat and SOB/shortness of breath that lasted about a minute. The EMT checked her out and asked her to stay longer and she did and after about 5 more minutes the same thing happened again. These episodes lasted about 1 minute and she had dizziness with it. Also she did not have any further episodes and she stayed a long time. Her concern was whether this was indicative of an allergic reaction and should she still get the second dose. The patient was asking for information about 2nd dose being given after 42 days. The patient stated that she has not had any more of those symptoms at all. The patient arm was sore and swollen that was all now. The events heart rate increased, dyspnea, pain in extremity, and peripheral swelling was assessed by the reporter as serious (medically significant). The outcome of the events heart rate increased, dyspnea, and dizziness was recovered and unknown for the remaining events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues.

A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EN6201, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Feb2021 at 04:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medications included tolterodine and adalimumab (HUMIRA). The patient reported that she received the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 at around 4:30. Firstly it was fine, she felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore. What concerned her was the swelling started almost immediately after the shot on 18Feb2021. She knew that was one of the symptoms. This morning and yesterday though (18Feb2021), she noticed some of the symptoms. She got a large knot that was right above the injection site. Yesterday, it was about the size of a half dollar, today it is about the size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot. It feels like an egg under the skin or a clot. Like a knot (a hard spot underneath the skin). The patient was wondering if it was something she should be concerned about because the swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area. It was a rectangle and is about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high and then right above that was where the needle went in. The large circle or knot was right above that and she was thinking possibly when she was given the injection she has never really bleed before. So, she thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm. She got no problem. That happens at times, but she started thinking if this was a clot or it was something that is right above there because it is so pronounced, and it really hurts. The patient stated that she took some Aspirin last night and is going to take an ibuprofen in a little while. She mentioned that she takes this one pill and it has nothing to do with anything.  The patient had lab work done (unknown results) that was about 3 weeks ago (2021). She also stated that she also take Humira which is a shot every 2 weeks and it said in the fact sheet that she should be concerned or be sure that she did not take any medicine that affects the immune system and Humira does weaken the immune system but she was not ask that prior to. The patient wanted to know if is that something she should be concerned about. Outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EM9810, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 01Feb2021 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization at a Physician office. Medical history included asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, pneumonia and borderline high cholesterol. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had her first COVID-19 vaccine on 01Feb2021 and second one is due on 22Feb2021. On 03Feb2021, the patient had a headache, but didn&#39;t think too much because it is a side effect. The headache lasted all through the weekend. Visual disturbances began 04Feb2021.

The patient was admitted to the hospital for an ischemic stroke. By looking at the MRI, the onset of the ischemic stroke would have been five to seven days prior, placing the onset on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, which was also the onset of her headache. There is no definitive cause of her ischemic stroke. The patient currently has an arrhythmia monitor on. MRI/MRA showed her vessels looked good. MRI showed evidence of the ischemic stroke. The patient has neurologists since being admitted to the hospital. It was thought that the headache was just because of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Causality was unknown, it was stated that they haven&#39;t found anything else as a cause. The patient&#39;s doctor stated she was borderline for high cholesterol. She was not hypertensive, but supposedly is now. The patient also had echocardiogram, EKG, manual neuro checks, and blood work but does not have the results. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                The evening after patient received vaccine, she started to develop low grade fever and urticarial rash at the vaccine site. The urticaria improved the following day, as did the fevers. Then 3/5, the fevers started again, several times per day, as high as 102 at home.  In association with the fever she has had some mild nausea, x1 non-bloody emesis last night, as well as rigors/night sweats.  She went to urgent care and eventually was admitted to the hospital for the following 9 days. During this admission, she continued to have fevers intermittently as high as ~103. She also developed more generalized urticarial rash (worst on trunk), and lab abnormalities including low platelets and elevated liver function tests. She had extensive testing, ultimately determined likely vaccine reaction, started on prednisone 40 daily and improved for discharge to home on 3/17 without fevers x48 hours and with improving labs.

The heaviest shaking was of the right arm and hand which was where the vaccine was administered. Made my way to bedroom on my walker to tell hubby I was not feeling well,  Took blood pressure which was elevated and my heart felt like it was beating out my chest, Bllod pressure was elevated and so was pulse. Shaking continued and breathing was shallow, Waited 10 minutes and retook vitals, BP and pulse up more, Called 911, Paramedics came and monitored my vitals several times which after 20 minutes started declining, Could not say conclusively if was vaccine related. Elected due to Covid not to be transported to hospital and signed off on declination, Was told by paramedics to call 911 again if symptoms reoccurred and go to hospital,  In successive days I still continue to have pin-prick feelings and numbness in my right fingers, More difficult to walk than usual,

I realize that the stroke could coincidental but thought I should report it just in case for information in the event others had similar event.

Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

Noteworthy, I had  as a precaution taken prednisone 20mg p.o  about 2 hours before the injection.  I had to take more  later that afternoon because of symptoms. I then seem better but several times since the vaccine I have needed to uses the inhaler  and take prednisone  more than I have except after an infection about 6 years ago that precipitated similar symptoms to now. Today I had a flare significant enough that except for covid I might have gone to the ER or urgent care.

                                                I was hospitalized with a severe reaction to my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine given 2/1/21 @ 9:45.  I was discharged Tuesday evening 2/2/21.  Dr., my internist, agrees that what happened was not a vasovagal syncope (hospital?s diagnosis).   My Experience: Within say 7 minutes of the injection I felt woozy, the wooziness intensified, I got intense pins and needles in my lower legs, fore arms and hands, and less so in my face. My speech became very slowed down, slurred  and I had a lot of difficulty forming words. It was as if I was extremely drunk. After they called the paramedics, I was not able to get myself out of my car or walk.  I lost motor coordination/control in hands and feet.  I was cold, never felt faint, and had slightly evaluated blood pressure for me( normal is 110/64 paramedics got it at 152/94).

The next day (Sat) I was still not feeling well, weakness on my limbs, I went to the hospital to see if I could get checked and they told me to return on Monday because Occupational Health was closed on the weekends. I went home and treated myself with Tylenol and Vitamin C. On Monday I got tested and was positive. By then, I was coughing, limbs weak, had temperature (101F).  I started to get weaker an weaker and Tuesday or Wednesday my work called me and asked me if I would like to come see a doctor. Wednesday I started with shortness of breath. I called my PCP and he prescribed me an albuterol inhaler. It helped me but my cough got worse by Saturday. My doctor then told me to go to the hospital (I live by myself).  At my choice I went to Medical Center and were admitted and was hospitalized for 6 days.  They kept treating me with inhaler and oxygen. They wanted to send me to rehab but I told them I wanted to go home. I came home with oxygen and with albuterol inhaler and the ambulance had to bring me home. I still was feeling very weak, had cough, and had the shortness of breath. And I have been home since then. I have home health and a therapist that come check on me 2X a weekly.

                                                she felt so tired; her breathing was heavy and felt tight; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL9262), at age 67 years, injection into the left upper arm/deltoid, first dose on 27Jan2021 14:00 at single dose, for COVID-19 vaccination. Ongoing medical history included diabetes diagnosed more than 10 years ago and high cholesterol diagnosed around 10 years ago, maybe longer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were unspecified maintenance medications because she is diabetic and has high cholesterol. She said that she has been taking these medications for a long time though already. Patient was a retired registered nurse that was calling about the COVID-19 vaccine and reported that she had the first dose injection on 27Jan2021 at 14:00 and 2 hours after she got home, she felt so tired that she did not feel like moving and her breathing was heavy and felt tight. Patient said that her breathing feeling heavy and tight did not last too long, maybe an hour then went away. Her tiredness, felt so tired lasted through the day and whole night and she was fine and completely recovered after waking up in the morning. For breathing feeling heavy and tight: She clarified that it lasted from like 14:00-17:00 yesterday 27Jan2021. Patient wanted to know with the symptoms she had is it contraindicated to get the second dose? She was reading the information about the injection and seemed like the symptoms are part of it. The outcome of the events was recovered, for felt so tired was on 28Jan2021 and for breathing was heavy and felt tight was on 27Jan2021. Case was reported as serious with other medically important condition as seriousness criteria. The reporter assessed the events she felt so tired and her breathing was heavy and felt tight as related to the suspect drug COVID-19 Vaccine.   No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported events cannot be completely excluded given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 67-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot/batch number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in Left arm on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in hospital; antilymphocyte immunoglobulins (reported as immunoglobulin infusion, concentrate for solution for infusion, lot/batch number and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dosage for an unspecified indication. Medical history included CVID (Immunodeficiency common variable), Addison Dx (diagnosis) and Pituitary Tumor. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. No known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had syncope within 10 minutes of injection on 19Jan2021, episode, BP (blood pressure) 70/40, P (pulse) 40-30, admitted to ICU in Jan2021, determined adverse event maybe 2nd to immunoglobulin infusion received previous day leading to Adrenal Crisis, 2nd to Addison dx / Pituitary tumor which was unknown at time of vaccination. Events were resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Patient had been hospitalized for 6 days in Jan2021. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The action taken in response to the events for antilymphocyte immunoglobulins was unknown. Therapeutic measures were taken as result of the events syncope, BP 70/40, P 40-30 and Adrenal Crisis. The outcome of the events &#34;syncope, BP 70/40, P 40-30, Adrenal Crisis&#34; was recovered in 2021. Patient then received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 08Feb2021.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of antilymphocyte immunoglobulins in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of antilymphocyte immunoglobulins has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT152B2 and antilymphocyte immunoglobulins to the events syncope, low BP and heart rate, adrenal crisis, cannot be excluded. The underlying Addison disease and Pituitary Tumor are major cofounders for the events.

                                                I received the 2nd Covid injection.  I went to the 15-minute waiting area.  The waiting area was full, so my husband and I were standing.  I stand and work every day, so this was not difficult.  I texted my daughter, who is a hospital employee, and told her that we had a super experience with no wait and had already received our 2nd dose.  However, 5 to 7 minutes after the injection, I SUDDENLY felt dizzy and weak and had to sit down.  Within a minute or so, I could not stand or open my eyes.  The weakness made it difficult to breath or talk.  My husband had to lift me up into a wheelchair.  I was taken to the ER.  For the longest time, I could not even open my eyes or talk above a whisper. After 4 hours, I was able to get my eyes open and talk better.  I, gradually, was able to move my hands and feet.  Last of all, I could move my hips and walk.   It was as if my body had been put to sleep.  I could feel everything but my body wouldn?t move.  As it wore off, my face and limbs felt slightly tingly.  I was, basically, fine after 5 hours other than being tired from the experience. The doctors had no explanation for what happened and said it must be an emotional response to getting the shot.  They wrote that I was not exerting enough effort to move my body.  One said that I was hyperventilating when I pulled my mask up to breathe after he told me to hold my leg in the air.  Though I tried, I was too weak to hold my leg up and it fell to the bed. The doctor told me that I should not tell anyone about what had happened or people would not come to get the Covid vaccination.  He obviously knew that SOMETHING had happened that I couldn&#39;t control but he didn&#39;t put that in his report!

Her doctor and her did not know if her blood pressure going up could be from the vaccine. Her doctor told her to take more of her already prescribed blood pressure medication. The next day, she went to see her doctor due to blood pressure still being high and he gave her more blood pressure medications. Her doctor prescribed a different kind of blood pressure medication to take along with her existing blood pressure medication (BYSTOLIC).

                                                Could have died with a blood pressure with these numbers; Blood pressure had spiked up to 235/104; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Feb2021 at 13:00 at 67-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the Pfizer suspect vaccine. Medical history included blood pressure increased (BP raised) in Sep2020 (BP reading was 135/80).  There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced: &#34;could have died with a blood pressure with these numbers&#34; (medically significant, life threatening) on an unspecified date, and blood pressure had spiked up to 235/104 (medically significant, life threatening) on 11Feb2021 at 16:30. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient reported that she was a healthy person; and she had never had blood pressure problems before (as reported). The patient also reported that she was &#34;on no medications whatsoever.&#34; Five months ago (from the time of the report), the patient had a wellness exam. The patient&#39;s &#34;blood pressure was perfect.&#34; It was reported that &#34;everything was perfect&#34; with her health exam five months ago. Five months prior, the patient&#39;s BP reading was 135/80. The patient thought that the COVID vaccine was very dangerous and she was unaware that hypertension could even be a side effect. The patient received the vaccine on 09Feb2021, and she &#34;got a long fine while waiting at the facility.&#34; Two days later, on 11Feb2021, the patient took her blood pressure and she could not believe the reading. The patient then went to a pharmacy and had the pharmacist take it for her because she thought &#34;she was crazy&#34;; and because she thought her machine was not right. The patient&#39;s blood pressure had spiked up to 235/104. When the pharmacist took her blood pressure, they told her she needed to go to the ER immediately. The patient was informed her blood pressure was beyond stroke level; therefore, she was rushed to the ER and was given IV BP medications to try and get her blood pressure down. The patient was released to home. The patient, after she went to the ER the first time, she was told to go see her primary care the following day. Two days later she was back in the ER with spiked blood pressure on 13Feb2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure on 13Feb2021 was 224/84. The patient was again treated and released.   The patient stated that she saw who she believed was a physician assistant (PA). The patient was started on a blood pressure medication as well; and her last and most recent blood pressure reading was 144/85. The patient reported that the she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide. After the patient&#39;s first ER visit, she was prescribed 12.5mg once a day. However, after the second ER visit, she had a blood pressure spike and the dose was increased to 25mg once a day.  The patient received the paper with side effects, and she had none of the side effects listed; &#34;none, whatsoever.&#34; The patient read that the more severe side effects were difficulty breathing, fast heartbeat, rash, dizziness. The patient further stated that &#34;under that, it was list serious and unexpected side effects may occur&#34;; this was where the patient felt like her situation come in. It was serious and unexpected. The patient reported that she was upset; and felt that she could have died with a blood pressure of those numbers. The patient reported that she was a healthy person and she was looking forward to getting the vaccine. The patient stated she would not be getting the second vaccine. The patient wished she just had the normal listed side effects such as arm soreness, joint pain, fever, headache; however, she did not experience any of those events. The patient felt that if she did not check her blood pressure at home on her own, she would not have known her blood pressure was that high. The patient then added she had spoken to a couple of doctors and they had a total of five cases that were very similar to hers and had to be treated. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: spike on an unspecified date, blood pressure: 135/80 in Sep2020, blood pressure: 235/104 on 11Feb2021, blood pressure: 224/84 on 13Feb2021, blood pressure: 144/85 in Feb2021, health exam: everything was perfect on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown. Adverse events following prior vaccinations: None. The patient did not remember getting any other vaccinations.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

A 67-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: unknown) at 67-year-old vaccination age at a single dose in the left arm for covid-19 immunization and sucrose at unknown dosing regimen for an unspecified indication, both via an unspecified route of administration on 30Jan2021. Medical history included diabetes. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) and insulin for diabetes. The patient reported that she received her first dose on 30Jan2021 with no problem at all but this past week her blood sugar levels have been climbing. She normally was 120-150 [unknown unit] then all of a sudden, it&#39;s 200 [unknown unit] something or 300 [unknown unit] something and then the last couple days (2021), she was battling 500 [unknown unit] and something. She was just wondered because she looked at the ingredients in the shot and it has sucrose, so she just wondered if that is why her sugar levels are rising. The patient has tried getting hold of her doctor to ask the same question, but her office is closed since last three days, so they didn&#39;t have their phones connected. She reported that she did not have issues with the shot, its fine didn&#39;t get sick or anything. She&#39;s just worrying if that&#39;s the reason her blood sugar levels are rising. The outcome of the events unknown.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

                                                I am writing this on behalf of my mother. She received the first round of the vaccine (Pfizer/EL9269) on 2/18/21. That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

A 68-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot /batch and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she got the vaccine yesterday (07Jan2021) and that a couple of hours later she began to experience neck stiffness, coughing with production of white mucous and felt like she couldn&#39;t breath with tightness for about a half hour. The patient was asking if this was normal. Outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Seemed to subside in about 30 minutes.  Took a benedryl at bedtime.  In morning, seemed ok, though took another benedryl.  Seemed OK on this next day, but before bed, face was puffy, then woke up at 3:50 a.m. Saturday, and throat glands swollen and was having difficulty swallowing.

Vital signs were taken.  Blood pressure up slightly, heart rate slightly elevated Sent home without treatment but recommended I should take antihistamine at home. I took a 12-hour allegra about 12pm and a single 25 mg benadryl tablet at bedtime. The symptoms lasted about 3-4 hours before resolving.  They did not get worse from the immediate reaction. Recommended contacting my family physician for advice of what to do before 2nd shot which is scheduled for Feb. 15, 2021

                                                Patient presented to the ED on 1/21/21 for evaluation of SOB stating her husband tested positive for COVID earlier that week and she has been around him. The patient states her symptoms started 3-4 days prior to presentation. She admits to cough, nausea, and an episode of vomiting the day of presentation. She had been intermittently using her husband&#39;s oxygen prior to presentation which she says has helped with her symptoms, but does not use oxygen at baseline. Upon presentation the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation rate on room air is 89%. Patient was placed on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula and then was saturating in the mid 90s. CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates in the ED which the ED physician felt to be consistent with COVID infection. The patient&#39;s rapid COVID test resulted as positive. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management of hypoxia related to COVID infection. The patient remains hospitalized on the day of report submission (1/28/21)

A 68-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 06Jan2021 at single dose on right deltoid for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure high and seasonal allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EJ1685) on 16Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced community acquired pneumonia, shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness, fatigue, COPD, muscle aches and pains, she became ill, all on12Jan2021; arm soreness on an unspecified date. Events required Emergency Room visit. Clinical course reported as: she got the second dose of the pfizer covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 and on 12Jan2021 she experienced shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness and fatigue. Nurse stated ER doctor thought she had COPD or community acquired pneumonia. Nurse further stated she had the second COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021. A week later on 12Jan2021, she became ill. She had all the symptoms of COVID. She was short of breath, very fatigued. She couldn&#39;t get any air, she was at work. She had muscle aches and pains. The shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness lasted several days. She also had severe chest congestion. She confirmed she got better. It actually took 4 or 5 days. By that Sunday (17Jan2021) she was better. She wanted it noted she had no reaction right after the shot. She stated she only had arm soreness, it was just a little sore, not even worth mentioning. It was only when she moved her arm a certain way. This was with either vaccine (first or second vaccine). She went to the doctor and somebody thought it might be a reaction, but the nurse thought it was too late for a reaction. The ER doctor thought it was COPD and community acquired pneumonia. Her primary doctor thought it was COPD. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test: negative on 12Jan2021. Outcome of arm soreness was unknown, others was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the drug-event time interval and the vaccine&#39;s safety profile, the  community acquired pneumonia is possibly intercurrent condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162B2 administration, which is not the disease that the vaccine BNT162B2 can prevent from. While the COPD is more likely underlying condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162 injection.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli; pulmonary hypertension; short of breath; right heart strain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 68-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE, lot number=EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration at right arm on 22Dec2020 08:00 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included uveitis, arthritis and known allergies: pine nuts. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone (eye gtt), naproxen as needed (PRN) less than weekly.  The patient previously took theophylline and experienced allergies. The day after getting the first dose of vaccine the patient worked all day in another (clinic withheld). She felt well all day, but at 6 pm when she left to go to her car she was so short of breath she had to stop twice to get there. Subsequent work up has shown that she had multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. Adverse event start date was 23Dec2020. Adverse event start time was 06:00 PM. The adverse events resulted in: [Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization for 1 day, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event)]. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Lovenox and Eliquis. The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile the reported events are unlikely related to bnt162b2 .  These are probably intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 24Jan2021 09:22 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included degenerative disc disease (first disc came out) from 2007, chronic fibromyalgia from 2005, rheumatoid arthritis from 2000 (went into remission for a few years; while in remission, she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia), vertigo (diagnosed when she was 24 years old; bout of vertigo about twice a year; last year, 2020, was the worst bout of vertigo she ever had), allergy to shellfish (hives, itching, welts), sulfa (anaphylactic reaction), and mostly pain related issues. There were no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the COVID vaccine knowing that she had a reaction to the first dose. She had a reaction which she believed was from the vaccine she received. She felt something immediately but did not concern herself with it, was kept for 30 minutes for observation. Her heart rate went up (from 89 to 99) and then her heart rate came back down. She said after the 30 minutes had gone by, she felt better. On 25Jan2021 and 26Jan2021, she felt extreme pressure when she breathed, like an elephant sitting on her chest which lasted all day. Patient woke up the next morning and pains were still there. It was also reported that the patient had extreme chest pain on 25Jan2021. She said that the chest pain was not like a heart attack, but she felt a lot of pressure and weight when she was breathing in. By the time she went to bed in the night of 25Jan2021 night, she felt fine. When she got up the next day, Tuesday, 26Jan2021, and started moving around, the chest pain came back. When she woke up on Wednesday, 27Jan2021, everything was all gone. Patient is scheduled for her second COVID-19 vaccine shot on 14Feb2021. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The patient recovered from the chest pain on 26Jan2021, from heart rate went up on 24Jan2021, and from the other events in Jan2021.

Then, a week after the 1st dose on 27Jan2021, her blood pressure went up to 210/101. She went to the hospital, they controlled her pressure and put on a pressure pill 1 a day (amlodipine). She mentioned she had felt a weird sensation on an unspecified date and as she noticed some spikes in her blood pressure, her MD told her to take another 2.5 mg amlodipine if needed (once or twice a day as needed). She confirmed she had no heart rate problems but she actually experienced high blood pressure instead. She never had numbness, instead she had a tingling sensation still present.

Admitted to hospital for hospital for 1 day.  Was given anti-vomiting/dizziness drugs, CT scan, IV for dehydration, pain and anxiety medicine. Diagnosis was vertigo. Upon release from hospital, consult with internist further diagnosed condition as labarynthitis. Headache and slight dizziness continued for a couple of weeks . After second dose dizziness, light-headedness and headache are significant enough to  take Tylenol regularly. These effects are still in place 12 days after 2nd dose. Will see internist if symptoms continue after 2 weeks.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

Uncomfortable tightness in chest and a lot of pressure on face feeling like it was hot. I felt a little better after 15 minutes while waiting but never told anyone about symptoms. I walked out and drove home but monitored my symptoms.  The symptoms gradually became less and were gone after 1 hour and 45 minutes. I took a dose of benadryl at that time.  I slept well that night and woke up with no symptoms and none since.

                                                I felt quite sick, like I had the flu; became very lightheaded and dizzy; passed out; felt quite sick; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 69-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included R.A.D., osteopenia, migraine with aura, the patient had previously suffered episodes of vasal vagal syncopy when she got the flu or other severe illnesses, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included atenolol, atorvastatin, azelastine, and fluticasone. The patient previously took gramicidin, neomycin sulfate, polymyxin b sulfate (NEOSPORIN) and experienced allergies. The morning after receiving the vaccine, she felt quite sick, like she had the flu. When she got up from bed and went to the bathroom to urinate, she became very lightheaded and dizzy. She attempted to return to bed, but passed out on the bedroom floor before she could get to the bed, and seized while she was unconscious. Once she came to, she was helped to bed and, after about 90 minutes, felt much better, and got up, and ate food and had coffee. All events occurred at 07:30 AM on 09Jan2021. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I became weak and thought I was going to faint. I called the medical professional over and they brought me into a staged area for triage. My blood pressure was 171/ 104 or 114. I had chest pain. The EMT did and EKG, listened to my heart, and started an IV. The ambulance was called and I was transported by ambulance to the hospital. At the hospital another EKG was taken, blood pressure and blood work. Repeated blood work was taken. I was admitted to the hospital due to elevation of tyoponin level and chest pain. The following day 1/22/21 I saw my PCP and he thought it was related to the vaccine and recommended a cardiologist for the increased levels of tyoponin and chest pain.  The cardiologist performed another EKG&lt; more blood work and performed a cardiac catheterization and a ECO. Both were normal. Prior to that I was given a nitro pill as my chest pain was between a 7 and a 8; a few minutes later the nurse asked about my pain level and it was a 3-4. I was given another nitro pill and shortly after I felt extremely faint and my blood pressure was 56/32. I was immediately given a bolus of saline IV . The chest pain continued through the day. The following day, I had no further chest pain, my tyoponin levels returned to normal and I was released from the hospital.

So then i left it alone because I didn&#39;t now if that was part of a reaction. When i got home i still had the odor in my mouth. i drank cold water and it went away. I waited. I felt sore on my arm but it wasn&#39;t that bad but as the hours went on it started getting more sore and painful. My arm was sore up to my shoulder and the back. After that the pain started traveling towards to my chest and i started getting pain in my chest. i took Tylenol (1 500 mg extra strength at 11:15 PM). So i waited 15 minutes to go to sleep. i got up the next day and everything was the same, i started putting ice on it and gave it time. I took another Tylenol but the pain was in my chest again a little bit. The third day the pain didn&#39;t come back in my chest and from then i was alright. I also started getting an itch.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 14Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included left hip replaced on 16Nov2020 and had her right hip replaced on 29Dec2020. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported that she got the shot at 1:30 pm and on the way home she started getting tired and exhausted on 14Jan2021. She got home and went right to bed. She felt like she couldn&#39;t stay awake, fell asleep and woke up about 6 pm then with a temperature of 105.5 and stated it would fluctuate between 104-105. She was just feeling horrible. At 7:30 pm, patient had a temperature of 103.5 and at 7:45 pm, her temperature was 104. On 14Jan2021, patient stated that she couldn&#39;t see straight, had blurred vision, having trouble walking, her balance was off and falling into walls. Her body was jerking and the arm that she got the injection in was dropping. Patient called her cardiology office, and was advised to take Tylenol 3-4 times per day and alternate it with Motrin. She was also taking coated 325 mg aspirin. She can hold her head up and was not jerking as much as she was. She was doing noticeably better. Patient had put ice bags on her groin, stomach and throat to try to cool down through the night. This brought temperature down to 103. She woke up at 12 am she was 102. Her temperature at the time of report was around 101-102. She took her blood pressure it was going crazy, first it was up around 163/71 and then over time it was really low 118/58 and heart rate was 130 for a while and went to 103. The back of her neck still felt so weak and she still feels extremely weak and exhausted. She went on to report that her HR was high and B/P was up but since then it has come down. The night of 14Jan2021, her b/p was low.On 14Jan2021, patient was also real thirsty and her urine was darker and was probably dehydrated and thought that she was real jerky muscle-wise, like she is not in control of anything last night. That she has not taken BP or heart rate on 15Jan2021, but it was not pounding today though. She was doing better today at the time of report. Patient was recovering from the events of fever, blurred vision, and balance was off; not recovered from tired, jerking, and dehydration. Outcome of remaining events was unknown.

                                                I give the girl in front of me the Covid vaccine way high on her arm. I told MA do not give my shot that high up. She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis, ongoing high cholesterol,  ongoing high blood pressure, celiac disease from 2005 (this has been tested too many times to count and it has been negative since after initial diagnosis 2005), arthritis (all her life) ongoing, hip replacement surgeries first done in 2005; repair of same hip in 2015; other hip in 2017. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Historical vaccines include Pneumonia Vaccine, Shingles Vaccine and Flu vaccines; all on an unspecified date for immunization. She never had adverse events with those. Ongoing concomitant medications included rosuvastatin (5 mg tablet) for high cholesterol, mesalamine (400 mg capsule) for ulcerative colitis and lisinopril from 2018 for high blood pressure. According to the patient, she knows that mesalamine is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory to keep inflammation in the colon down. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021 14:30 with immunosuppressant mesalamine. The night of 14Jan2021 patient had headache, chills, body aches, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and dizziness like Covid 19 symptoms. She went to the ER during the past 11 days for IV fluids due to deyhydration from the diarrhea. Today, 25Jan2021 is the first day she has been out of the house, except to go to the ER, since she received her 1st vaccine dose. On Jan2021 muscle pain, neck ache, backache, problems with balance and problems with walking. Events probably started with intense diarrhea starting 14Jan2021; then Fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit and chills 14Jan2021; Specific onset dates and onset times unknown otherwise other than between 14Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 onset dates. It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3248, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 24Jan2021 07:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetic. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient&#39;s granddaughter had COVID virus and passed to the patient. The 2nd dose appointment scheduled for 14Feb2021. Patient stated she had the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 24Jan2021 at 0715AM in the right arm. After that, she found out she got infected with COVID 19. On 01Feb2021, she tested positive for COVID 19. On 28Jan2021 (also reported as on 28Jan20201 or 29Jan2021), she was feeling bad. Her little granddaughter had COVID virus (was infected at the school) and passed it on to her. Now she has been going to different places checking it out and she went to urgent care because her heart was beating fast on 02Feb2021. She had an electrocardiogram and her lungs were okay on an unspecified date. They told her was eligible to get an infusion but she doesn&#39;t know what it is. The urgent care clinic told her she could get the infusion but then she can&#39;t get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She wants to ask if this is true. She was being offered a monoclonal antibody infusion. When ask if this is the first time to call, she stated she called once before right after she found out that she had the COVID 19 infection to ask if she could still get the second shot. She did report at that time that she had gotten the first dose and then tested positive for COVID 19 and she previously provided product information including the lot number from her vaccine card. She added that her heart has been going very fast and has been having fever on 02Feb2021 for two or three days. It is not as high today as it was before. She does want to get the second dose. The first dose helped her so much. On 04Feb2021 (reported as yesterday), she was checked at urgent care because of heart concern and a bit of pressure in chest. Patient stated she only had a little cough, sore throat and runny nose, but she hasn&#39;t experienced any other symptoms on an unspecified date. The patient&#39;s weight was 54.43 kg on 01Feb2021. The outcome of the events &#34;fever&#34; and &#34;her heart was beating fast&#34; was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was unknown. Patient was scheduled to receive her second dose on 14Feb2021.

She said that there is nothing wrong with her and she does not feel sick, she just hurts. She said that she was tired because she is not sleeping well due to the pain. Patient wants to know what pain medication she could use that will not counteract the vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EM5318), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper arm on 09Feb2021 at 11:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included premature ventricular contractions (PVC) from an unknown date wherein her pulse goes up into the 120s and had to go to the ER. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Pneumovax 23 on 14Jan2021. The patient called about the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The patient had the shot on 09Feb2021 and the 10th she was fine then on 11Feb2021, she started having side effects. She is calling it side effects but what she is describing, she has these episodes periodically but she has not had one in 2 years but it was bad one and it happened 2 days after her vaccine, she is not sure if it was side effect but she doesn&#39;t want to mess with it so she wants to tell someone. On 11Feb2021, the reaction started around 1:30 PM. She started feeling real jittery, she was hot flush feeling like an adrenaline rush in her upper chest and arms down to her elbows. She could feel her heart pounding and she had these before but no one seems to know what causes it. She worked with it she was busy doing other things then around 4PM that day it started getting worse. She could tell her blood pressure was getting involved. She started taking her blood pressure, from 4:30 on until 12:30AM she had crazy blood pressure fluctuations the highest was 188/89 and the highest pulse was 106 but it goes up to 188 and then it would be 158, 179, 155, 119, 166 and those are the top number of the blood pressure. Her pulse pretty much stayed high 80s 90s except for the time it was 106. After midnight, her BP was around 159 or 150 then it came down to 136/71 and her pulse was 78 and she slept much better, she slept for 4 hours she woke up feeling like heart pounding but her blood pressure was 125/69 and her pulse was 74. She also has PVC and sometimes they say when she feels her heart pounding and her blood pressure and pulse are fine, they said that is probably PVC. When her blood pressure and pulse goes way up she is miserable. She had it so that her pulse goes up into the 120s with this and she has had to go to ER before. She clarifies her pulse being in the 120s and having to go the ER was in the past, prior to the vaccine. She says no one can figure out what it is. Some said it was anxiety, she sat through a whole program on anxiety and they decided not that is not what it is. But the fact that she hadn&#39;t had one of these episodes in 2 years and she had a good sized one 2 days after the vaccine, she had a really hard one that is why she thought she better report it. It has definitely gotten better she still feels jittery and heat flush every once in a while, but her blood pressure is fine. It is 139/74 and pulse 74. She can tell its still there but improved and certainly not uncomfortable. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or the physician&#39;s office but she contacted her doctor&#39;s office and she has an online thing with them in a half an hour from the time of the report. The outcome of the event crazy blood pressure fluctuations the highest was 188/89/bp was around 159 or 150 then it came down to 136/71 and heart pounding/highest pulse was 106 was recovering while the outcome of the events feeling real jittery and hot flush feeling like an adrenaline rush in her upper chest and arms was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event  blood pressure fluctuation cannot be excluded. The cardiovascular medical history is likewise a risk factor.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 26Feb2021 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) and vitamin. The patient previously took BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (first dose on the left arm at 01:30 PM, lot number: EL 1283); and SHINGRIX vaccine in 2019, codeine and cipro and experienced allergies. On 27Feb2021 03:30 PM, the patient experienced chills, fatigue &amp; then sudden nausea &amp; lightheadedness that resulted in passing out. Unfortunately, the patient fell on a tile floor &amp; hit her head resulting in a 1.5 inch gash in the back of her head. When she went to the ER, it was determined that she now had vertigo (which she never had before) but obviously hard to tell if it was a side effect of the vaccine or from the fall. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the events which included CT scan, ekg, chest X-ray, bloodwk (unknown results) and Epley maneuver. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

                                                Low platelets; Rash on her body; Bruising; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus since 2011 (reported diagnosed 10 years from this report, ongoing congenital heart defect which patient was born with but did not find out until she was in her 50s; does not bother her too  much; one of the major arteries has a 90 degree angle vs. an S curve, mild multiple sclerosis; no longer has this as she has not had another relapse; she was diagnosed almost 30 years ago; she has never had another attack since she had 2 of them and was on medication that did damage to her liver, breast cancer; patient is a breast cancer survivor and issues with magnesium levels. There were no concomitant medications. On 28Jan2021 the patient had blood work done for her kidney doctor. They withdrew blood from her arm. They had a hard time stopping the bleeding afterwards. They finally got it to stop and put regular cotton balls and a band aid on it. By the time she was walking out she was bleeding out of her arm she felt in her coat. They were able to stop the bleeding again. This was at about 10 AM. Patient went home and afterwards was called back and instructed to go to the ER for critical care. Her platelets were low at 10,000 at that time. They got to the ER and they checked her platelets and they were down to 8,000. They administered some steroids; Prednisone. They decided to admit her after giving the treatment in the ER. After that her platelets came back to 11,000. The next morning on 29Jan2021 her platelet count was 7,000. They started administering the same drug through an IV. He thinks it was still a steroid. They did it in smaller amounts and overnight the next day her platelets were up to 26,000 on 30Jan2021. They continued the treatment during the night again and on Sunday they were 36,000 and they released her that day late on Sunday. They went back and did blood work yesterday on 01Feb2021. The local doctor said her platelets are up to 61,000. The patient was getting blood work every Monday and Thursday for 3 weeks. Th patient had blood work and platelets checked before the vaccine and they were normal. The patient was hospitalized from 28Jan2021 to 31Jan2021 due to the event. The patient also noticed rash on her body and bruising maybe on 21Jan2021 or 22Jan2021. The bruising was really bad on her left hand by her wrist. It was really dark. She was also bruised everywhere they poked her with an IV and bruises where they put the heart monitor on her and pressed down to stick it to her. The bruising is still all over her body. It has stayed about the same. The one on her hand is still severe. The other from where she has been poked are starting to clear up. Overall it was about the same. The outcome of event bruising was not recovered, low platelets was unknown while rash on her body recovered on unspecified date.

Family history was reported as none. Concomitantly, she was just taking daily medications that were not relevant. There was no prescriber for the vaccine.  It was through a hospital. It was reported that vaccination was given at 08:15 to 08:30. Patient had no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). No additional vaccines administered the same date of the Pfizer suspect.  Patient had not had prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Patient received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. She stated, on Tuesday 26Jan2021, patient was hurting on the waist around the back.

Her blood pressure went up to 211/92 and they were giving her morphine for the pain (Jan2021).  She was questioning if she should get the second dose. She has two autoimmune diseases and it was an overactive immune disease.  She took the one vaccine and her doctor said to contact Pfizer being as it is kind of new and especially since she has the autoimmune issues.  She would like to know if it is safe for her to have the second vaccine.  She does not know if she will be over this.  She does not feel well (Jan2021).  She was afraid of taking it if it will be any worse (Jan2021). Patient felt all right until she had the vaccine, on Tuesday the problem started (26Jan2021). They were giving her medication for the shingles and for the pain. Patient stated that &#34;it set something off&#34;. Patient was still sick (2021), still taking pain pills. Patient didn&#39;t know how many days she has. Her second vaccine is on 13Feb2021. As sick as she has been, and her overactive immune system and if she still has the shingles those can last a long time, she doesn&#39;t want to go through what she went through. This was a lot of pain and with shingles they can last, 6 months or a year. The nurse called her back and told her to report to Pfizer. Patient was taking the medicine for the shingles right now. She doesn&#39;t know what will happen. She doesn&#39;t want to be sick. Patient asked for the efficacy after 1 dose and how much protection it has. She did fill out something because she talked with someone else.  She confirmed it was through VAERS and not with Pfizer. She said the pain around her waist was a little better because they gave her the medicine for shingles and she has pain pills. She said one was Valacyclovir and she could not remember the name of the other. Patient had required two trips to ER.  First one was on 27Jan2021 and went to internal medicine doctor and that night went to the ER.  They did CT scan and it was not bladder or anything. Second visit on 29Jan2021 and did CT with contrast and the doctor thought it was shingles since she had shingles three times before.  She has had them internally.  The doctor said it would not necessarily need to be externally break outs.  The next two times she did not break out.  She did not have anything around her waist. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events hurting on my waist around the back, kidney infection, diverticulitis, shingles, and sick. The outcome of the event hurting on my waist around the back was recovering. The outcome of the event kidney infection, diverticulitis, shingles, sick, blood pressure went up to 211/92, does not feel well, and &#34;afraid of taking it if it will be any worse&#34; was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient (who was not pregnant at the time of vaccine) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number; el3249) via an unspecified route of administration, at right arm on 14Jan2021 14:00, at hospital for COVID-19 Immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), GERD (Gastrooesophageal reflux disease), oral cancer 2020 with surgery only, arthritis, hypothryroid and allergies to nickel. Concomitant medications included, irbesartan (AVAPRO), levothyroxine, liothyronine (NP THYROID), lansoprazole (PREVACID), ibuprofen (MOTRIN) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took metoclopramide (REGLAN) and prochlorperazine edisylate (COMPAZINE); patient had allergies to both drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. List of medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination, included: avapro, np thyroid, prevacid, motrin, Tylenol. On 14Jan2021 at 14:15 (after 15 minutes of dose), the patient experienced feeling very hot, lips numb and tingly, headache, dizzy, heart beating hard in chest, anxiety, waited another 15 minutes, taken to ER (Emergency Room) on site; elevated blood pressure, nausea with dry heaves. Patient was taken into Emergency room/department for urgent care and received treatment IV solumedrol, ativan and zofran, oral Benadryl. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date in 2021; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events headache and nausea were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other reported serious events with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

There was a sense of nausea initially but it went away. There was pronounced feeling of heat located subcutaneously on my right outer thigh. It came and went about every minute or so. (I counted the seconds in between each incident). I am still experiencing flu like symptoms (bodily aches, slight headache, mild chest pain, and general ill-feeling.) I will contact my primary care physician today about my concerns but felt it necessary to document these mild but disturbing side effects.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number EN6205) via unspecified route of administration on unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was not provided. Upon 15 minutes after injection, she noted nausea with belching and had some SOB. Symptoms worsened as she ambulated over to the medical bay along with her chest pressure. She denied rash, hives, welts, hoarseness, stridor, itching, lightheadedness, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. Patient reported recently admitted for unstable angina and CAD with tachycardia. Patient had elevated d-dimer and blood clot was ruled out. Patient discontinued on new medication, beta blocker. Since discharge this Sunday 21Feb2021, she reported chest heaviness as if she has &#34;cardboard on chest.&#34; Can slightly increase with going up and down stairs or increased activity. She states she had reached out to her cardiologist via an online site but has not heard back. Patient stated her pain is about the same today. Patient complains of chest tightness and shortness of breath. The outcome of events was unknown.   No Follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of events unstable angina and tachycardia cannot be excluded. The patient&#39;s age and suspected cardiac condition are risk factors. The event CAD, given its progressive nature, is most likely an underlying condition, thus unrelated to the suspect drug.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

                                                I thought I was going to die; Sick; over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high; I had such bad chills; nausea; I would throw it up; arm was so bad, it had it&#39;s own pulse, a pulse of it&#39;s own, I couldn&#39;t lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain; checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90; my chest was shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via a Pfizer Sponsored program. A 70-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 70-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included viruses, flus (I have had viruses, flus my whole life), five surgeries, gallbladder removed, and asthma, all from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) on an unspecified date, at the age of 70-years-old and experienced a very sore arm. On an unspecified date in Feb2021 the patient experienced, &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34;. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;I wanted to call today because I got the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 3 weeks ago, 03Feb2021 it was. After the first dose I had a very sore arm and that was it. It was more sore than normal vaccine, but it was that was all I had. After the second dose I was not aware that I would get sick to the extreme that I did. I found out afterwards that other people have said this, I did not know at the time. I thought I was going to die. I am a 70-year-old woman, I am not young, and I have had viruses, flus my whole life and I got so sick. First, I had over a 103 temperature, it came on suddenly, 12 hours to the minute after I got the vaccine. On top of that I had such bad chills I never saw anything like that in my life, 5 blankets on top of me, sweaters, sweatshirts and the fever was so high. I could not keep the Tylenol down because I had nausea and I would throw it up. So, I could not even get rid of it. Then on top of that my arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all, plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain, it was excruciating. I have had 5 surgeries, my arm hurt worse than all 5 surgeries put together. And I had my gall bladder removed and everything, nothing hurt to this extent. Now also I have asthma, nothing severe but I do have asthma, so I have one of those little oximeters and you put it on your finger and it checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91, all night it was 91, my chest was shortness of breath. I was ready to go to the hospital. And I did not know it was going to be that bad.&#34; When clarified about the treatment the patient stated that &#34;yes, the Tylenol helped once I could hold it down. The doctor gave me something to stop the vomiting and the nausea. And then I could take the Tylenol and then the Tylenol worked great. But at first, I was so sick I could not hold the Tylenol down in my stomach I would throw it up, that was the problem.&#34; When asked about lab work the patient stated that she had not had lab work done since the first vaccine. She stated that she had stayed in the house because she had other health issues and was afraid to come out for 11 months. So she had not gone out to get anything done. The patient stated that she called because if a third dose was needed, she suggested that a smaller dose be given to small people. She stated that she took childrens medicine most of the time because she was tiny. She wanted to know if Pfizer in the future would be making doses for small people and doses for bigger people. Her suggestion was to have a separate booster to go by weight or by gender, men usually did not experience the same. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34; were all recovered/resolved on unspecified dates.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E18982), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:00 by injection once to left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) as blood thinner. Patient was calling about COVID 19 vaccine. She had the first shot 21Jan2021, and had had flu symptoms ever since on 21Jan2021 and when they gave the shot they didn&#39;t ask for her allergies or anything, and she read on a letter given after, she was taking blood thinners, she was not sure what they do to the vaccine, that wasn&#39;t asked of her either, before she decided whether to take second or not, she needed some answers, she hadn&#39;t had the flu for 40 years. Her shot was at 1PM, and about 6 or 7PM that night, she got hot and thought she would pass out and it went downhill from there. Patient did not have some medical problems that she checked off when she registered, none of that came through either. Patient was thinking about not taking the second shot if she didn&#39;t get some medical information. The outcome of event flu symptoms was resolving, outcome of other events were unknown.

                                                Immediately upon injection I felt totally dizzy as though I was drunk, slight pain at base of tongue left side. The dizziness somewhat passed within 40 minutes but not totally, same with slight pain at base of tongue left side. Went to bed as normal but awoke to having great difficulty breathing as soft tissue around entire neck was swollen as were lymph glands around neck area, that was pressing against my airway making it seem like I was suffocating slowly, being strangled by all the swelling. Hospital injected me with mega dose cocktail of large amount of steroids, Benadryl.  Symptoms subsided quite a bit at hospital only to keep continuing for nearly 2 weeks after. Because of this on Tues March 2, 2021 I had an appointment with my family doctor because the swelling was still quite intense. She put me on a 3-5 day dose of Prednisone.  I still have some swelling going on in my neck area from it today 3/20/21.  On item 21 I clicked Permanent damage as I&#39;m unsure if this swelling will be permanent and continue to come and go at this time or totally subside eventually. It&#39;s unknown at this time.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall.

Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal.

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.  After approximately 25 minutes, 911 was called and she was transported by ambulance to the emergency room in stable condition.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), lot no. EL9269, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The physician asked if there were any reports of paresthesia around the gums and/or tingling in the hands and fingers. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. About 1 week after receiving the vaccine (20Feb2021), she experienced symptom complex, consistent with a mild peripheral neuropathy/sensory peripheral neuropathy around her gums and lips on her left side, as well as tingling on 4 of the 5 fingers of her left hand, She was admitted and a full workup for central disorders and vascular disorders was negative (Feb2021). But her symptoms were continuing intermittently. She had numbness of the gums. A portion of the trigeminal nerve on the left side seemed to have been impacted. Also, peri-orally on the left side.  The physician asked if this symptom complex has been reported and if there were reports of these mild sensory peripheral neuropathies coming from the vaccine. The physician stated that any info on dental paresthesia or any reports of other incidents of sensory paresthesia would be very helpful. The patient also called about the COVID 19 vaccine. On 13Feb, she got the vaccine in and then one week later on the following Saturday, the date would have been 20Feb, she started having a sensation of tingling and paralysis in her lips and gums all the way down to her finger tips on the side of the injection which was the left side and that has continued. She went to see the doctor the following Monday 22Feb and not knowing what it was, she sent her to the ER she was kept overnight, she was discharged 23Feb but her symptoms persisted even through today. These sensations were happening on average 3 times per day, sometimes many more anywhere from 3 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes then it goes away. She did not go to her primary care. She confirmed her first dose was given 13Feb and the tingling and paralysis started the 20Feb it was still ongoing at this time. It has persisted but she can&#39;t tell whether it was getting better or not because sometimes it will last 3 minutes sometimes it will last 1 hour and 45 minutes. It started to effect other parts of her so she thinks it might be getting a little bit worse. It was starting to effect other parts of her body the progression goes, it started at the tip of her tongue and gums and then shortly within 30 seconds or less than a minute it spread to her upper and lower lip only on the left side and that was how it was on her gums as well it was only on the left side then she had the tingling in her finger tips on the left hand. She specified that she experienced these sensations on the tip of her tongue, left gums, lower left lip, and into the fingers on the left hand. She would like to know if these symptoms have been reported in association with the vaccine and if so, how long she can expect them to last. She stated that yesterday, a physician called in on her behalf for more information and said he received literature from 29Jan regarding reports that included information about dental paresthesia after the vaccine. She was planning not to get the second vaccine. She was not taking medications, she was in good health she did go and was admitted in the ER, they did a work up. Her blood pressure had sky rocketed on Feb2021 and since she mentioned sensation they ruled out a stroke. On Feb2021, they did blood work, MRI and CT scan and everything was they did not find anything linking to a stroke. She spent the night in observation. She was in the ER, they did put her in the main hospital but it was for observation from the emergency room. She went in on the 22Feb and was discharged home on 23Feb. She asked where this goes from here, these symptoms were concerning to her. She did not find any incidences at least in general of reporting this, asked if there were these kinds of things being reported, she didn&#39;t know how long it was going to last or if it will get worse. The outcome of blood pressure had sky rocketed was unknown while outcome of other events was not recovered.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at left arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included low sodium, Covid-19 in Nov2020 (She had felt sick for a week and on 13Nov2020 she went to the ER and they did blood tests and she could not eat or drink for 3 days. She stated that she had 4 different IV fluids going and one of them was sodium and the other was for nausea), blood did not clot properly, broke her back. There were no concomitant medications.The patient had a unique reaction after receiving the Covid-19mRNA Vaccine. She clarified that she never had a reaction to a shot before. She received the vaccine on 31Dec2020 and was fine for the first 20 hours. She said that the next morning on 01Jan2021 at 0600 she woke up cold  and could not get warm. She said that she spent the next 24 hours to where she kept adding clothes and blankets to keep warm. She stated that she was freezing and the she felt like the interior of her body was freezing even down to her toes felt cold. She also had injection site pain and the arm felt heavy and stated that the pain extended from her shoulder down to her elbow. She stated that the injection site pain was kind of delayed. She had aches and pains. She said that some of the pain went from the injection shoulder and spread to the middle of her spine. She had nausea and total loss of appetite and could not even eat. Her aches and pains after the vaccine were similar aches like she had with the Covid. She said that she had a terrible headache when she had Covid though. She stated that after the 24 hours of receiving the vaccine she had a little headache, but she took a migraine pill for it. She said that she was able to shed clothes, but she could not take a shower, but within 24-36 hours she was back to normal like it all never happened. She said that was when she figured out it was like her hemorrhaging with one of her childbirths. She explained that she had 3 children and hemorrhaged with each of her child births and was going into shock with one of them and felt this freezing sensation due to blood loss. She thought that her reaction to the vaccine was so bad that she was either not making blood or there was an interference. There was some kind of weird interruption. She said that her blood clots break down from minutes to hours after her child birth or with dental procedures. She had a PAI-1 deficiency or Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 deficiency. She said that there was also something deeper that her doctors had not figured out yet too. She said that her blood did not clot properly. She said that she did not bruise or anything, but she was not allowed to have internal surgery without a transfusion. She said that her doctor&#39;s started to figure this all out after she broke her back before. She went to a hematologist and had her counts checked regularly. She said that she was being studied by 127 different clinics. She gained 10lbs, but she was very physically active. This was her first dose of teh vaccine. She said that her doctors told her that she needs to be under 48 hours of observation if she gets the second vaccine. Her primary care physician recommended that she did not take another mRNA vaccine. She said that she was taking their advice and canceled her second dose appointment. She said that when she had Covid-19 they did a Chest x-ray on 13Nov2020 and she had low sodium. She said that they gave her tramadol at the hospital for her headache, but she had already taken 3 migraine pills that day. She had already had her flu shot and read somewhere on a website, that mRNA vaccines might cause unstable anticoagulation. She wondered if it could be possible that Covid-19 antibodies interfered with her injection? The outcome of events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 at a single dose in the hospital for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety, seizures, and high cholesterol. She passed out last summer and they put her in the hospital from 31Aug2020 and ran all kinds of tests. In the end, they said she only had a few PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and she doesn&#39;t need to see the doctor for a year. Mentioned she also has chronic bronchitis and this is related to having low platelet count and low immunity. All of these events predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin for high cholesterol, clonazepam for seizures, escitalopram for anxiety, levothyroxine sodium for thyroid, and mirtazapine for sleep; all were ongoing. Stated that she had something weird happen after her injection about four hours after the shot. She received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 in the right arm. About three or four hours later on 13Jan2021, she was getting ready for bed and when she sat down and leaned over she had a god awful burning in her chest and nausea. She was going to take baking soda but when she sat up she had horrible pressure and pain in her chest and felt woozy so she sat on the floor and then the pain started to radiate through her arm and into her neck. The horrible pain and pressure in her chest felt like something was sitting on her chest and the bad pain in her chest was going into her arm and a little into her neck. She laid real still on the floor, and did a lot of praying, and then 20 minutes later it totally stopped. She got up slowly and finished getting ready for bed and was fine. She was just hoping they will still let her get the second shot. The whole event only lasted 20 minutes and when it was over it was completely gone. She did tell her husband when he came home. She was alone when this happened. The patient wanted to know if she can receive second dose of vaccine. She stated it almost felt like a heart attack. She was planning to get the second dose on 03Feb2021. Wanted to know if her effect will preclude her from getting the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 14-JAN-2021 at the 72 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included COPD so sometimes she would cough, kidney stent, rheumatoid (&#34;two&#34; Tylenol and 20 mg prednisone for &#34;her rheumatoid&#34;). The concomitant medication was clarithromycin (MACROBID) from an unspecified date to 12Jan2021. The patient got it on the 14Jan2021. She says she had been doing fine she didn&#39;t know now. She was a retired paramedic so she usually felt things out, she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching on 14Jan2021 but she did not think anything of it. Friday evening she had a good time eating some walnuts and she woke up about 2:30 itching that was Saturday morning before day, she took Benadryl and went back to sleep later then later on she was itching a little again in the palm of her hands and she just took a Benadryl and it went away. Then Sunday night, last night, she was okay so she decided to go to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl, they had no Benadryl and she only had old Benadry. Then about 12:30 she started itching on her bottom, itching on her arms and she was scratching. She noticed she was having some face soreness in Jan2021 but she was using some expired facial cream so she thought that was why her face was sore so she put some hydrocortisone cream on it. Since she was itching she decided to take a little of her nieces Benadryl, it is pediatric Benadryl. She was itching so she called her doctor and she heard him in the ER say they had too many people in there to tell her to go to the ER so she said okay. She hung up and called the pharmacy and they said it sounds like having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she told him she had the COVID vaccine but she doesn&#39;t think she was short of breath and she gave them her vitals her BP was 152/85(BP 157/85) that was high for her in Jan2021, but it came down, she took some Tylenol then it was 146/77, her pulse rate was 77 and her respirations were good she did not have shortness of breath or cough well she has COPD so sometimes she would cough. Then she got up and said let me go one over and get some Benadryl so she went by there got some good Benadryl and she thought she would call and see what they think about all this. She took the Benadryl at 10:25 and she is doing okay right now but she had whelps, she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching in Jan2021, it is on the left side of her hip, the cellulitis part of her skin that is mostly where she is itching in Jan2021. She remembers when she worked at the health department they would give Benadryl and Prednisone. She thought if the Benadryl does not help then she would call, then she decided she would go ahead and call to see what information they have. She says Pfizer is giving her alerts that she has been answering but she did not have the itching at that time. She retired from being a paramedic in 2009. She says she is 72 now but she woke up in 1985 and her lip was swollen like not totally swollen but her top lip was swollen more than the bottom in Jan2021. They gave her an Epinephrine shot and Benadryl and she is just wondering if this itching is related to the vaccine or if it is just an allergy that she may have come up on or something like to the walnuts or something. She says they went there and they gave the shot and they gave Benadryl but they are not sure. She said the doctor never figured our what it was that cause it and it never happened again until she did notice a little puffiness on her lip again this morning. She said the itching first started around 2:34 AM in the morning before light. It had improved since taking up to date Benadryl. She was supposed to get her second dose 04Feb2021. She didn&#39;t want COVID 19. She knew she just came off, she had a kidney stent and she had stopped taking 2 days before, she was taking Macrobid. She was not taking that right now. She took a lot of other medications but the Macrobid she was just on and it was stopped on Tuesday 12Jan2021, 2 days before the vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if the Macrobid would interfere with getting vaccine. The outcome of the event itching was recovering, the other events was unknown.

This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: 2021040024) on 18Jan2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 19Jan2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (Hashimotos&#39; Disease), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease) and HAEMORRHAGE (she has a bleeding disorder/ a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding) in 72-year-old female patient who received apixaban (ELIQUIS) for an unknown indication. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included COVID-19 VACCINE for an unknown indication. On an unknown date, the patient started ELIQUIS (unknown route) and COVID-19 VACCINE (Intramuscular). On an unknown date, the patient experienced AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (seriousness criterion medically significant), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (seriousness criterion medically significant), HAEMORRHAGE (seriousness criterion medically significant), CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY (allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes) and DERMATITIS CONTACT (allergies to adhesive, and polymers). The action taken with ELIQUIS (Unknown) was unknown. At the time of the report, AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS, MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, HAEMORRHAGE, CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY and DERMATITIS CONTACT outcome was unknown. Consumer reported that she had read the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and have some questions to the &#34;What should you mention to your vaccination provider&#34;. Caller mentioned that she has allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes, adhesive, and polymers such as the angio-seal that was used on her for a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding. She has irritation from the polymer and described it as a sponge that was meant to be absorbed for a month. Her first question was does the COVID-19 vaccine contain latex, mold (polymers) and adhesive? Response: For latex. For mold (polymer) and adhesive: &#34;A review of the ingredients list on the product label show that mold (polymer) and adhesive are not part of the formulation, however, Pfizer does not specifically manufacture the vaccine to be free of mold (polymer) and adhesive, therefore, we cannot assure that it was &#34;mold (polymer)-free and adhesive free&#34;. We cannot guarantee that minute amounts of substances are not contained in raw materials obtained from our suppliers. She had the PPSD23/Pneumonia 23 vaccine last 05Jan2021 and was told not to get the COVID-19 vaccine for 14 days. Is it because of the injection site or is it for systemic reasons? Consumer mentioned that she was on ELIQUIS. She has Hashimoto&#39;s Disease and Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease. She said that she was not immunocompromised. She mentioned that she has a bleeding disorder. The Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine can only be administered as an intramuscular injection For ELIQUIS (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Reporter&#39;s causality assessment was not provided.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Causality assessment for ELIQUIS: Events: Hashimoto&#39;s disease, Contrast media allergy, Topical adhesive allergy, Mixed connective tissue disease were considered unrelated while bleeding was considered related.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: BMS Medical Evaluation Comment: This patient had autoimmune thyroiditis, mixed connective tissue disease and hemorrhage after receiving apixaban therapy. This patient also had COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the anticoagulant action of apixaban, its role in the event hemorrhage is considered as possible. Based on the etiology of the reported events, auto immune thyroiditis and mixed connective tissue disorder are considered not related to apixaban.

A 72-year-old female received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 28Jan2021, 11:00 AM (lot number:EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient medical condition included right Bundle Branch Block, cardiac from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no known allergies. The patient concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and Upgraid. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in the left arm on 06Jan2021, 02:00PM (lot number: EL3249) at the age of 72 years for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested after the vaccination for covid-19. Twenty-four hours after vaccine received, on 29Jan2021 at 03:00 PM, the patient suddenly lost ability to speak intelligibly. The patient stated &#34;I was completely aware though a little &#34;foggy&#34;. Blood pressure 170/84. Friend present thought I was having a TIA and called 911. Ambulance came.  Within 25 minutes, my ability to speak returned slowly. By the time I got to the ER, (45 minutes after onset), my ability to speak had mostly returned.&#34; Many blood labs were drawn, CT of head done, MRI of head done. EKG done. No cause of incident or evidence of TIA seen. After 5 hours, the patient was discharged with orders to come back if symptoms reoccurred. The patient had a headache, scratchy throat, fatigue and body aches in 2021. Since then the patient had a variety of tests, labs and Dr. visits. Blood pressure has been higher than her normal of 120/80, at intervals during the day in 2021. Since no evidence of TIA has been found, the patient was wondering if there have been any other reports of this loss of speaking ability (aphasia) occurring with any other vaccine recipients. The patient received treatment for the events. The consumer considered the events as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On 2/2/21 I developed chest pressure and irregular heart beat at 4:00 pm.  Went to ER and it spontaneously resolved while staff was telling me how they would treat it.  Gave me Metoprolol 5 mg IV with 500 IV fluids and discharged.  Then on 2/6/21 I slept poorly and felt very jittery and had more chest pressure but pulse was regular.  then on 2/8/21 at 6:00 am I awoke and felt terrible with chest pressure.  Took my blood pressure at home and it was  193/103, and I was very shaky.  Went to  ER where they did blood work, X-ray, and monitored my heart and blood pressure for 4 hrs.  Gradually my blood pressure came down, and my blood work and X-ray probed to be WNL.  I was discharged without medication change but had echocardiogram scheduled and follow-up  appt. with Cardiologist, on  zoom.  He started me on Flecainide 100 mg bid, and stress test on  2/24/21 and follow-up appt. with him on 3/3/21.  I also had a follow-up appt. with my GP the day after the first ER visit and she ordered more labs, and the echocardiogram.  I have continued to have feelings of fluttering and pressure in my chest off and on and they continued after my second vaccine.  But my heart has remained regular since starting the Flecainide.  But my blood pressure went up to 150/85 on 2/9/21 and again to 142/81 on 2/10/21 both times with feelings of jitteriness and pressure in my chest.

                                                chest pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 72-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9262) on her left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Open heart surgery in 2006. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient had the COVID shot on the 25Jan2021, she and her husband, and she sat for 20 minutes, everything was fine, she got in the car, and was going down the road, she had chest pains, then it eased up and it stopped then probably another 25 to 30 minutes later is started again. The chest pains started probably a half hour after the shot. They went away, then she had it three times that day, and once today, and once yesterday, so they are ongoing. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9262, expiration date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at left upper arm around 19:00 or a little later at single dose (at the age of 72-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included bad knees and got injections for this and recurrent cellulitis of legs (cellulitis was not active at time of vaccine; but anytime her leg swells with bad knees she had a little episode with the cellulitis down around her ankles on both legs but left leg was more predominant. She had been keeping it at bay), mineral supplementation, bad knee pain, blood pressure medication (abnormal), urine output control (abnormal), dehydrated and dizzy. Concomitant medication included lisinopril as blood pressure medication, potassium for Mineral supplement, solifenacin succinate for urine output control, paracetamol (TYLENOL 4) for bad knee pain. She had taken potassium before and it calmed it down: she was little dehydrated, little dizzy, so was drinking some Pedialyte, water, and taking potassium. The patient had it once before but it kind of snuck up on her again. The patient called to ask if anyone had reported any type of blood clot on the same side of the body that the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. She questioned if she might have a blood clot in her left leg after having been administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She had recurrent cellulitis in both legs prior to Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The doctor thought the cellulitis in left leg may be acting up and that she might have an infection in that area of cellulitis. She reported pain in the left leg when she rested her leg on a pillow; but did not feel any pain when she was standing and walking. The pain became a little too hard for her to bear so the doctor prescribed her Cephalexin 500m capsule every 12 hours-she was on the 3rd capsule now. Onset date for the events was approximately 03Feb2021 or 04Feb2021. The events were better since started Cephalexin. Second dose date scheduled for 22Feb2021 but did not give her time. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Follow-up (23Feb2021): New information received from the product quality complaint group includes confirmation of lot number (EL9262) and new expiry date.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 73-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 10Jan2021 and didn&#39;t have a reaction, but had a slight pain in her arm on 10Jan2021. Her sore arm started on 11Jan2021. There was a sore spot and when she would pick up her arm it was sore and achy. No pain, but sore and achy. It lasted for a day or two. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms until Saturday the 16Jan2021, this past Saturday she thought she was dying. She had chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and had a headache. She thought she was losing her mind. The headache just stopped today. She had the chills that would not stop and she thinks she broke the sweat on Sunday (17Jan2021). She had a little nausea and couldn&#39;t eat anything on 16Jan2021. She had a terrible headache, which just stopped about 2 hours ago. She stated she must have to take 10 Tylenol over the course of time, every 4 hours. On Saturday 16Jan2021 she was just laying on the floor in pain. She was not even eating, just drinking water. All of her symptoms stopped this morning around 5 AM (18Jan2021). She had a big sweat. She is unsure if she had a fever because she does not have a thermometer. She is unsure if she has recovered completely from these symptoms. She feels weak, and is still weak (on Jan2021). She cannot go out or get dressed or shower. She is not strong enough. She is just sitting up now, no longer laying in bed. She couldn&#39;t walk (on Jan2021) and was afraid she was going to faint on 16Jan2021. She can walk a little bit now and feels a little bit better. She has been out of it for three days, She hasn&#39;t felt good. She asked if side effects can appear 6 days later? Is this normal to have a reaction 1 week after getting it? She asked are the side effects worse after the second dose? She asked is this Covid or side effects, what are the COVID symptoms? She asked should she take the second one if she had these side effects? Caller clarifies this is the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Whoever vaccinated her did not give her the paper about it afterwards. Her neighbor brought it to her cause they went together. She did not realize she could experience these things. She did not expect them a week after getting the vaccine. She thought she had COVID. She asks, &#34;do you think I have COVID?&#34; She is just now getting better and it has been 3 days of experiencing these symptoms. Should she get the second vaccine? She is trying to do the right thing. Event outcome of chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and headache was recovered on 18Jan2021, for was going to faint and couldn&#39;t walk was recovering, for weak was not recovered, while for others was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed 15 years ago, maybe; High cholesterol diagnosed 20 years ago, she doesn&#39;t know, reflux diagnosed 20 years ago, maybe more, prediabetes and allergy induced asthma which she carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year. Patient reported that she was tested and they don&#39;t know for sure, but she reported that she may have allergy induced asthma as she has to take, carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year, in the fall when leaves are falling down, the leaves get moldy, and she was driving in her car, or walking in a wooded area, she gets tightness, takes her inhaler and was fine, that&#39;s the extent, no other circumstances; fall or she had where a plant was blooming outdoors, she gets tightness, and she took her inhaler, and was good for the next year, so sitting in the environment and nothing further materializes, if she takes the inhaler three or two times a year, considering what other people have, she thought this was insignificant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she got vaccinated this Friday and had nothing but a sore arm afterwards, on 16Jan2021 and was fine all day, evening, all day Saturday. She just had soreness at the site, she had no redness at the site of injection, but the weird part: she doesn&#39;t think anyone would believe, 33 hours later, at midnight, she was still up, on her way to bed, and all of a sudden she experienced extremely excruciating stabbing pains in her arm with the shot, it was stabbing, excruciating, and immediately at the same time, she had shivers/shivered and had a splitting headache, was freezing and had to put socks on, and had noticed very slight difficulty breathing, and since it was midnight, she didn&#39;t want to wake up her husband, she dozed off, and was up at 0530. She had body aches, slight, it was the least, but the stabbing stopped in her arm. She slept from 12:30 to 05:30, and the shivering and aches stopped, but the headache was still on, so she took a pill for the headache. She took the thermometer that marked 100F orally; she stated that the fever was higher in the night and she assumed with the shivering, she had a greater fever than 100. Also, the oximeter indicated 133 pulse and 86 of oxygen saturation. By 10:00, it all had resolved. She has an oximeter, and since she still had the feeling of difficulty breathing, she put it on, but her pulse was 133, that was when she was feeling better. It was reported that all symptoms were gone except for rapid pulse, it was 133 and the slight breathing, and her 02 saturation was anywhere between 86-88, it varied, and by 10:00, all issues resolved, her heartbeat was down to normal, her breathing was above 94, or whatever, everything was fine, and has been fine since then. Maybe she had fatigue on Saturday and Sunday, on Sunday was like after the flu, after you finish, you have fatigue and was a little out of it, this was on Sunday. On an unspecified date, the patient stated that she was shrinking and weight varies. Patient stated that the only thing she does have, says she has a cough, but because she needs a drink, she was not sick and she gets to drink water. She felt like the reaction she had was in the limit of a severe allergic reaction due to the rapid heartbeat and her difficulty breathing. She would like to know if there was information about these side effects reported so she can determine if she was going to have the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of events states she was shrinking, weight varies and cough was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was recovered on an unspecified date.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) for 5 years at a very severe level 4 years ago to the point she was hospitalized for 10 days and her platelets were almost count zero. Concomitant medication included amlodipine. It was reported that despite patient&#39;s condition, she has received multiple vaccines, mostly flu in the last 4 years, and had no problems. 11 days after the 1st dose, patient&#39;s platelets dropped from 244,000 to 94,000 on 18Jan2021. Patient consulted the hematologist and was prescribed with 20 mg of Prednisone. Then, after 14 days, his wife&#39;s platelets rose back up to 248,000 on 20Jan2021. Patient was scheduled to receive the 2nd dose of the vaccine a week from the time of report. Reporter to know if patient should still get the 2nd dose, and if there have been studies for people with ITP and the use of the vaccine. Patient had a rapid Covid test on Monday (18Jan2021) that came back negative and antibodies test on Monday afternoon. Outcome of the event was recovered.

On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

                                                irregular heart beat; congestion in the chest; dizzy/the dizziness she was having and feeling now after getting the vaccine was definitely more noticeable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient). A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid/ left upper arm in the shoulder on 26Jan2021 around 14:00 (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: stroke about 4-5 years ago in June, dizziness, blood pressure. The patient also had difficulty writing stuff down; besides having a number issue, she had issues writing numbers down. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from an unspecified date and ongoing as a blood thinner. The patient stated she was on ten different medications. These medications were added after the stroke. Before the stroke she was not on any medication. The patient did not have any vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient got the pneumonia vaccine (unspecified), but thinks it was longer than 4 weeks before. She did not remember, but she believed it had been a month and a half to 2 months (at the age of 73-years-old) since getting the pneumonia vaccine for immunization. The patient had the COVID shot on Tuesday of this week (26Jan2021), and she didn&#39;t seem to have much of a reaction other than what they expected except at 21:00 that night, she got pretty dizzy. She was still dizzy now. It was enough for her to have to walk with a cane in order to try and keep herself leveled. She could not move quickly. She did not know why she had this reaction. She called her doctor the next day, and he did not understand why. She mentioned she was reading material and saw this could be a severe side effect/situation. The doctor mentioned they were trying to find out if it was related to the blood pressure. She wanted to know if this is part of the side effect, dizziness? When the patient was attempting to provide the zip code, she stated her mind was going blank and could not remember the zip code. She later found something with it written on it and provided those details.  She explained she had a stroke when trying to provide her current age. She stated numbers are hard for her. She stated she would be 74 in March, and questioned how old that would make her now, she later confirmed as 73. She read information today about the COVID vaccine, and she saw that one should be cautious about the vaccine if have a bleeding disorder, and she commented she was on a blood thinner. She went to the doctor last week and mentioned she was having dizziness. She clarified she had dizziness before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. When she went to the doctor, they thought it was due to blood pressure as the problem. They changed her blood pressure medication by placing on a higher dose. Then she started having more dizziness, and the dose was taken back down to the dose she was on before. She also added, she has an irregular heartbeat (unspecified date). She went to the doctor because of congestion in the chest (unspecified date); that was why she went to the doctor. The doctor asked about dizziness and she said she was having a little. However, the dizziness she was having and feeling now after getting the vaccine was definitely more noticeable. The clinical outcome of dizzy was recovering (as reported). The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

This other HCP reported for a 73-Years-Old (same age at vaccination) female patient that she received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot number EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medication was none. She had not been back to her pcp for &#34;several years&#34;. No known history of HTN. She did have a blood pressure cuff at home. During her 15-minute waiting period after the injection on an unspecified date, the patient began to experience L arm/hand numbness. Monitored patient for severe reaction symptoms, including but not limited to blood pressure abnormality, chest pain, rapid progression of symptoms and respiratory distress. Treatment included: no therapy. Follow up response was excellent. Patient discharge: stable to go home and follow up with PCP. Outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccine (because she&#39;s 74 and high risk). Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included irbesartan oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date (maybe 3 years ago) and ongoing at 300 mg once daily (150mg, 2 tablets once a day in the morning) for hypertension as blood pressure medication. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on Monday (11Jan2021) morning (AM) at 10 at the county (public) health department. She had no problem at all until yesterday Tuesday, she experienced mild swelling; the swelling happened in the upper left arm (swelling of left arm) which started on 12Jan2021, this was also the same side that she got her vaccine on, the left arm. On 13Jan2021 she woke up at 4AM [also reported as thirty (30) hours after the shot] in which she started to have severe chills (horrendous chills), could not get warm under the blanket for an hour and a half. It lasted a long time. Her severe chills did stop, she used an electric (heated) blanket. This morning on 13Jan2021 at 8:30, she woke up with the fever, which she was able to reduce with acetaminophen (did take two acetaminophen). Her fever was also gone. She was a little concerned because she thought her breathing was deep too on 13Jan2021. She did some relaxing breathing which helped. It lasted a long time. The patient also experienced a drop in blood pressure on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running the past few days at 133/80 on 11Jan2021. Today (13Jan2021), she took her blood pressure and it was at 93/50. It went to 87/56 after drinking some salty soup on 13Jan2021 (the bottom number in the blood pressure was going up a little, and the top number was going down a little). Her blood pressure has been normal 133/70 on Jan2021, but this morning it was 90/50 on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running normal the last couple of days like 133/90 on Jan2021. She was shocked it was lower. She knew they talk about dizziness and weakness, but she didn&#39;t experience that. She was concerned about that sudden drop in blood pressure. She did some research and started eating some salty soup and stuff (has been drinking salty soup). Her bottom number went up to 53 on Jan2021. She was concerned about that drop there. She was wondering if that was a side effect of the vaccine (result of the vaccine). She asked if drop in blood pressure was a concern. She had no positive test for Covid before the vaccine. She never had any tested, she&#39;s been pretty isolated. She had no antibody test. She has had no issues with vaccine in the past. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe chills/could not get warm, fever, her breathing was deep, and drop in blood pressure. The outcome of swelling of left arm/mild swelling and drop in blood pressure was not recovered; of severe chills/could not get warm was recovered on 13Jan2021 05:30 and fever was recovered on 13Jan2021; and of her breathing was deep was recovering.

                                                My mom only had site soreness after her covid vaccine on 1/21 which resolved within a couple days. However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

Evening of day 2, rash to legs progressed to purpura, temp of 102.7, chills and extreme pain to bilateral hips which prompted taking to ED and being admitted to progressive care unit.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID-19 virus in the past year (2020) from which her husband died last year (2020), receiving occupation therapy (OT) at home, and stroke (in the past). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine dose on 16Jan2021 and is scheduled to receive her next COVID-19 vaccine booster on 06Feb2021. The last time the patient had her COVID-19 virus antibody blood work was on 11Jan2021, and her COVID-19 virus antibodies were down to 1.9 from 8 (on an unspecified date). The patient&#39;s COVID-19 virus antibodies have been progressively going down since she was first being tested for them. The patient received a call today that her occupational therapist tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Both her occupational therapist and she were wearing masks when working together. The patient received the call today because she was exposed to the occupational therapist. The patient asked if she can still take the COVID-19 vaccine booster that she is scheduled for on Saturday (06Feb2021). The patient really wanted to get the COVID-19 vaccine booster on 06Feb2021. The patient was going to be speaking with a trained healthcare professional when she is transferred to Pfizer medical information. Anyone the patient has spoken to about getting her second COVID-19 vaccine has not been willing to answer her questions. The patient&#39;s blood pressure feels really high now (02Feb2021), and she has had a stroke in the past. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 74-year-old female patient receive the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), intramuscularly at site of right arm on 28Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included (synthroid: Taking for years), prevent urinary tract infection (UTI) (methenamine: started a year and a half ago), vitamin supplementation (Preservision Areds 2 eye vitamins more than a year ago; Vitamin C with Zinc 8-9 months ago), dry eyes (Thera tears: dry eye therapy. she has not been consistent with taking), cholesterol (simvastatin: taking 20 years or more), allergic to Sulfa Drugs and Tetracycline, obesity (had been fighting it for 30 years), removed polyps (had a flat polyp that was a little more dangerous the first time and it was removed; non-cancerous), got the flu (08Jun months later, got the flu, went to the hospital and developed PNA) and eczema (took calcium 1200mg). Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid; methenamine for prevent UTI; ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2) for vitamin supplementation; ascorbic acid, zinc (VITAMIN C WITH ZINC) for vitamin supplementation; carmellose sodium (THERA TEARS) for dry eyes; simvastatin for cholesterol; calcium for eczema. The patient previously took Flu vaccine (Injection site was left arm, intramuscularly) in Oct2018 and experienced pain in injection site and redness in arm; took the first dose of BNT162B2 with lot number: EL3246, intramuscularly in left arm site at 09:00 on 08Jan2021. Clinical course: After the second dose of vaccination, patient noticed tenderness at vaccinate site at 13:00 and had pain in arm on 28Jan2021, but on 29Jan2021, the pain was worse, and she had difficulty lifting her right arm at 16:00. On 30Jan2021, she started noticing more pain when she lifted her arm, her arm pits, it was hurting under arm when she was lifting. She thought maybe there were swollen glands but did not feel it. her temperate was 100.8, and she took some paracetamol (TYLENOL), by the evening, her temperature was at 98.6 normal. On 31Jan2021, she noticed a lot of pain, itching and redness, redness moved from actual site down her arm about 6 to 7 inches at 14:00. The pain in her right arm was not as bad as it was, but the redness in the area and itching was there, it was hot to touch area on right arm, and she tried cold compresses and took paracetamol. Also, it was hurting under her arm when she was lifting. She experienced something like that before with a Flu vaccine. She noticed when she looked it up, the information states, yes. And it was still going on today, not so much pain, just swelling and redness, looked like what Moderna calls a covid arm. She had no temperature, a little headache on 31Jan2021 at the back of the head and tired, very tired, she was tired from 29Jan2021, and was better from 01Feb2021. She took paracetamol last night, and cold compress. she used to take baby aspirin; she didn&#39;t know if it would be a problem. She read not to take paracetamol or ibuprofen before vaccination. She felt tugging and redness when she raised her arm, it was not red its blotchy. She didn&#39; t feel any swelling. The last 7 to 8 months, she was running high blood counts, 12.3 (high) and she had no infection, her doctor was a little nervous, the last one on 15Jan2021, it was down to 10.2 within normal range. Her immune system was very active. She had a flu shot in Oct2018 at age of 72 y/o and by 08Jun months later, she got the flu. She went to the hospital and developed PNA. In 2019 and again this past Aug2020, she had a Colonoscopy where they removed polyps. She had a flat polyp that was a little more dangerous the first time and it was removed. It was non-cancerous. The doctor was just watching it. Last blood results were 2 weeks prior to having first shot on 15Jan2021. The only thing that showed was her Liver enzymes were a little elevated. She was told that if she hadn&#39;t gotten the vaccine, it would have been worse, her doctor gave me the zpack. They were calling it a subcutaneous sensitivity, she had eczema, she forgot to mention that. She was taking calcium 1200mg, she forgot to tell her that also. The outcome of events pain in arm, redness and feeling hot was not recovered; of events tiredness, body temperature increased, itching and headache was recovering; of rest events was unknown.

                                                heart palpitations/ palpitations; patient decided on her own to take Levoxyl sublingually / started taking a little more/ started increasing the thyroid medication; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) received via the Medical Information Team and the Pfizer-sponsored Program.   A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot/ batch number: EL1283 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 (at 74 years old) at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization, &#34;for fun, for fear&#34;;  and levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL Tablet), orally from 12Nov2020 to an unspecified date and sublingually at the beginning of Jan2021 (also reported as 20Jan2021) to an unspecified date at 0.25 mg, daily (she would take half of the tablet in the morning and half at night) for hypothyroidism. The patient&#39;s medical history included hypothryroidism from an unknown date. Patient&#39;s height used to be five foot three with weight: between 140 to 150 pounds, usually around 145 pounds. Concomitant medications included Magnesium Malate at 1000mg and at 200mg (lot number: X002OISTE1 and expiration date: Aug2023). She got Magnesium the heart doctor told her to get. She stopped taking it on 22Jan2021, two days after the first episode on the 20Jan2021. Patient previously had problems with another thyroid drug, it was a natural thyroid medication called NP THYROID and she had palpitations on that one. The drug was not as standardized because it is natural thyroid. She started it in 2019 and took for a year and half. She was on a higher dose, 30mg originally and dropped down to 15mg or .25gram because it was &#34;too much.&#34; The pharmacy sent a notice out that a dosage was too high in May or Jun. Then in Sep the dosage was too low. She asked pharmacy about the lot number and they said they didn&#39;t put it on there. She got it from (Pharmacy name withheld). RX number: 1677890-07298. Manufacturer: (Company name withheld). The dose amount had dropped, and she wasn&#39;t getting enough of the drug and her TSH had gone very high. That was causing the palpitations. Then she was switched to levothyroxine sodium.  On 20Jan2021, patient experienced heart palpitations. It was reported that at the beginning of Jan2021 (also reported as 20Jan2021), patient decided on her own to take levothyroxine sodium sublingually and she experienced heart palpitations. Patient confirmed that this was not prescribed to be taken sublingually. Patient asked if taking levothyroxine sodium sublingually increase its potency. Also, on 20Jan2021, she received the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine. Her thyroid levels taken this past Friday (29Jan2021) were normal. Patient asked if taking the Covid vaccine with levothyroxine sodium cause palpitations. She wanted to know if there is data on taking levothyroxine sodium sublingually. She wanted to know if it has more of an effect and wondered if taking levothyroxine sodium sublingually might have effected it. She doubts if Pfizer has studied it sublingually, but would that have increased the potency of the levothyroxine sodium? Maybe she got more than she was getting before. On 20Jan2021 she received Pfizer&#39;s COVID19 Vaccine. She started having palpitations that night and she was not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with it. The palpitations are ongoing. Some days they get worse and other days they are ok. She thought she was low on levothyroxine sodium, so she started taking a little more. She knew she was supposed to call the doctor.  The day after she got palpitations, she started increasing the thyroid medication and it didn&#39;t seem to help. Over- the- counter Zinc, Magnesium, and Potassium helped. Zinc seemed to have most effect at trying to reduce them. It was reported that patient took Zinc 30 Orotate (lot number: 210606, expiration date: Nov2020). She took it on three occasions when she had it bad. Within a few hours after she took it the palpitations calmed down. Patient also took Potassium (lot number: 8BO3217 and expiration: Mar2003). She has only taken it twice since the palpitations.  She doesn&#39;t take those normally except for the Magnesium. She went to the doctor yesterday, but she didn&#39;t see the doctor and only saw the nurse. She underwent thyroid test on Friday, 29Jan2021 and it was within range. The TSH was not high, meaning she was getting the correct amount. She doesn&#39;t know how quickly taking the half thyroid pill would have effected it at that point. Supposedly she is within range, but still was having palpitations. Some days are really bad and other days not so bad. The levothyroxine sodium is the same prescription bottle. She just switched from taking it orally to sublingual. She took it orally for the first several months and then switched to sublingual, for both, she would take half of the tablet in the morning and half at night because she was so reactive to medication. She was concerned if she should get the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine because &#34;you never know.&#34; The patient further reported that she saw the cardiologist in the fall, and he did EKG and didn&#39;t find anything unusual. She is going to go see him again tomorrow because her other doctor said if the heart palpitations are bad enough, she needs to go to the ER and get EKG. She just had EKG in the fall. She knows it was a reaction to something. As soon as she started getting more thyroid medication in her, it went away. The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown and for BNT162B2 was not applicable.  Outcome of the event heart palpitations/ palpitations was not recovered.

                                                pain in chest through back; tongue swelled up; difficulty swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine; lot number EL9764/EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 01Feb2021 09:45 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing three stents in her artery, heart issue where they took test to see if she had a heart issue, and everything came back negative, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, overweight, penicillin allergy, IV iodine allergy, allergy to pollens, inhalants, dust and animals. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin (DILANTIN), bacitracin;neomycin sulfate;polymyxin b sulfate (NEOSPORIN) and cefalexin (KEFLEX); all of which patient experienced allergies/ drug hypersensitivity. On 01Feb2021 09:45, immediately after receiving the vaccine, her tongue swelled up, she had difficulty swallowing, and she has a pain in her chest that went through to her back. The patient was sent and admitted to the ER and got an IV shot injection of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) that got tongue back down. She didn&#39;t need an Epi pen, it wasn&#39;t that bad. They took the test to see if she had a heart issue, and everything came back negative. The patient was advised by the head of ER that she shouldn&#39;t get the second shot because of the reaction. It could be more severe with the second dose he said. The outcome of the events was recovered on 01Feb2021.

Per report, patient had SBP in the 80s on arrival but was asymptomatic. Prior to start of any procedure (no reports of being given sedative medications), she became unresponsive. CPR was initiated and was found to be in asystole. She received 3 rounds of CPR with ROSC. CT head without acute abnormality. Chest XR showing mild vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Initial labs showing AKI, elevated liver enzymes, BNP &gt;29,000, troponin 39, lactic acid of 11, INR of 6.6, PTT 62, APTT 87. UA with protein, nitrite, moderate blood. Urine culture ordered. Blood cultures ordered. In ED, patient was hypotensive requiring addition of vasopressors. Targeted temperature management was started. Ceftriaxone and flagyl started for possible urinary tract infection and aspiration. Patient with profound coagulopathy, INR increasing to 12.0 on arrival to the ICU. Two units FFP and vitamin K were given. Patient with escalating pressor requirements at this time so CT t/a/p was ordered showing multiple bilateral rib fractures, nondisplaced sternal fracture with small anterior mediastinal retrosternal hematoma, small right sided hemothorax, right chest wall hematoma, patchy bilateral airspace disease consistent with atelectasis/infiltrate/aspiration, diffuse GGO consistent with interstitial edema, enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary hypertension, cholelithiasis. FDP elevated and 2 units of cryoprecipitate given 3/16. Hemoglobin decreased to 5.9 3/17 with INR of 5.4. Two additional units of FFP and additional dose of vitamin K ordered. Two units RBCs ordered. CTA thorax and abdomen 3/17 re-confirmed hemothorax and chest wall hematoma but no active bleeding noted. CT bilateral LE showed no evidence of hematoma. Trauma consulted who recommended chest tube placement. Overnight 3/16-3/17, patient also noted to have seizure activity on EEG and patient loaded with Keppra. Head CT 3/17 negative for hemorrhage or other acute processes. Patient remained in status epilepticus 3/17am and additional Keppra load was given and neurology consulted.

                                                Immediately after injection, my face and body turned RED.  Nothing else. Just RED. I thought maybe BP, but never had that happen before.  I was anxious as I have anxiety disorder! But my face was RED and TIRED looking. I asked staff what wrong. No swelling at that time! 4:40 PM.  That nite, my heart started POUNDING HARD all night, not stop. Ativan not help. I slept, weird dreams, wake up and still heart pounding.  8 am --- got up and hands, arms, extremities SWOLLEN!! Heart still pounding,  Felt like allergic to MSG or nitrates or preservatives or too much salt. Felt weird.. Not faint-- just weird. Tired from the pounding heart. Not fatigued.  I did have sore arm, but it was NOT an issue.  My hands, toes were red.

A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

A 75-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Jan2021 04:00, she went to bed at night and woke up at 4 AM with a severe headache. She took Aleve and went back to bed. When she woke up at 8:30 AM her headache was very severe and was accompanied with very severe chest pain. She immediately took her to the ER. They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on February 5th but we are very concerned and hesitant as we don&#39;t want to cause any more damage to her heart. The patient was hospitalized for events &#39;headache&#39;, &#39;chest pain;&#39;, &#39;pericarditis&#39; and &#39;pain&#39; for 4 days. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination and did not received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included imaging: pericarditis on 16Jan2021 and Nasal Swab: negative on 16Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events which included Colchicine and prednisone, morphine and dilaudid. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events &#34;headache&#34;, &#34;chest pain&#34;, &#34;pericarditis&#34;and &#34;severe pain&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and disability. The events &#34;myalgia&#34;, &#34;asthenia&#34; and &#34;dyspnea&#34; were assessed as serious due to disability. The events (&#39;headache&#39;, &#39;chest pain;&#39;, &#39;pericarditis&#39; and &#39;pain&#39;) resulted in emergency room visit.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

It was noted that patient has had intermittent syncope since August of 2020 and clinical interpretation is likely that pericardial effusion pre dated vaccination.  In her workup for dizziness and syncope she had not previously undergone EKG, chest x-ray or echocardiogram therefore pericardial effusion could have been missed.  I elected to report the  pericardial effusion to be on the side of caution.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 21Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, amlodipine besilate (manufacturer unknown) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 10 mg twice a day for high blood pressure, insulin human (NOVOLIN R) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing as needed (U-100, inject 5 units by sliding scale if blood sugar over 150) for diabetes, clonidine oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 0.2mg daily, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.3 mg daily for high blood pressure, hydrazine oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 200 mg two times a day (2 tablets by mouth in the morning, 2 tablets by mouth in the evening) for high blood pressure. Medical history included ongoing thyroid nodule and her thyroid was okay and her numbers okay for cholesterol, ongoing dialysis, high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Since taking the vaccine, the past 4-5 days the patient&#39;s blood pressure and blood sugar had been out of whack. The patient had said something to her doctors about this because something was going on because she has been having to use her sliding scale insulin when her sugar got to 150. Usually was under 150 and if she went over that she took a shot of insulin if necessary. She had used insulin human more in the past few days at least once a day. The patient had not had to use insulin human in past, it was still almost full. Again, the patient had taken more shots since this Covid than she had had in a whole year. The patient just talked to the kidney doctor and then she was going to the Endocrinologist on Thursday for the first time. They maintain her blood sugar records at dialysis center. Blood sugar usually was between 115-130 and now last night it had been 168 and higher. The patient knew something was not right and it had not been like that for so long. The patient spoke with the dialysis doctor on 01Feb2021 about her blood pressure and they adjusted her medication. The patient clarified her blood pressure had also been high. When she left 01Feb2021 her blood pressure was 168/79 and later that day was 189/70 which was very unusual for her. The other day when she went home it was 136/78. It was the Clonidine that was adjusted was taking 0.1mg, 2 tablets a day to now taking 3 a day. The action taken in response to the events for amlodipine besilate, insulin human, clonidine, hydrazine was dose not changed. The outcome of events was not recovered.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [Amlodipine Besilate] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [Amlodipine Besilate] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.
