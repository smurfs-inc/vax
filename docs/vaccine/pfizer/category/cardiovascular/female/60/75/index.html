A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears.

Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches.

Nausea started at 11:00 pm on 11Jan2021 and got worse at 03:30 when she got up to go to the bathroom around midnight. She felt like she could vomit and felt better, but she couldn&#39;t. Her thighs were burning at 03:30 on 12Jan2020. It was persistent weak and burning. She can barely walk. The areas that have hurt like when you get the flu, she was having now in the same places, so she thought it was from the shot.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EL0140) via Intramuscular on 18Jan2021 into left arm at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism and neomycin allergies. The patient did not get covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included calcium, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), trazodone, tocopherol (VIT E) and no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EL9261) via Intramuscular on 28Dec2020 into left arm at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. 24 hours after injection she developed petechiae and was admitted to hospital with platelet count of 8,000 on 20Jan2021 22:00, the patient has ITP with baseline platelet count of 60,000. All events lead to hospitalization for 5 days (PENDING CLARIFICATION) and received IgG and oral Dexamethas as treatment. On 20Jan2021, the patient did Sars Co V 2 RNA test via Nasal Swab and result negative. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a close chronological association, a causal relationship between events petechiae and thrombocytopenia and  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

Medical history included hypertension (HTN) , hypergammaglobulinaemia benign monoclonal (MGUS) , mononucleosis (recent mononucleosis one year before).  Patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medication included venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR), hydrochlorothiazide/ losartan potassium (HYZAAR), amfepramone hydrochloride (TENUATE). The patient previously took IV dramamine, tetanus and ceclor and experienced allergy. Previously, on 18Jan2021 at 10:30 am (at 60 years) she took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE;lot EL3248) intramuscular in right arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Patient took the 1st dose of the vaccine on 18Jan2021 and 2nd dose on 01Feb2021 (inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered). Events were described as follows: next day, on 02Feb2021 at 06:00  temperature of 100.6, arthralgias and myalgias, dizziness.  Second day (Feb2021), temp lower but still around 99.8 (normal for her 97.2), vasovagal, dizziness, arthralgias and myalgias. Events were non serious. Patient (a nurse) treated herself with dramamine for the dizziness,  Nyquil and Advil. The final outcome of pyrexia, vasovagal, dizziness, arthralgias and myalgias  was recovering.

Thursday night I woke up in the middle of the night to the feeling of not being able to breathe. I laid awake for a while but dosed back off and it happened again a little later.   It felt as if someone was sitting on my chest which prompted me to go to the ER the next day.  Various test were done and I was admitted in the hospital for further observation. After admission I developed a massive headache which lasted from that Friday afternoon until that Sunday.  I was released on that Sat and the symptoms seemed to be getting better and by that Sunday evening all symptoms had subsided.

A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EP7534 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left second dose on 07Apr2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included cetirizine, diphenhydramine, and phenylephrine. The patient historical vaccine includes bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6203), right arm first dose on 10Mar2021 for COVID-19 Immunization. On 07Apr2021 21:30, the patient felt sluggish directly after receiving the second dose. The patient began feeling discomfort in my lungs about 5 hours after the dose. The pain in my lung/chest area grew worse throughout the night to the point where it was difficult and extremely painful to breathe. The patient went to urgent care in the morning, and they ran an EKG, urine analysis, and chest X-ray: all with unknown results. They were concerned it could be something worse along with potential pneumonia, so they sent me to the emergency room. In the emergency room, I received a CT scan where they found multiple pulmonary embolisms (1 large one in my right and multiple in my left lung). The patient stated that she had just had my yearly physical the previous week (Apr2021), with no signs of any health issues. With that, the doctors believed my condition to be related to my 2nd dose, so I was admitted to the hospital. I had to stayed for 2 nights. I am now on blood thinners, other meds (pain medications), and require oxygen during sleep (O2 levels drop too low). I have been referred to lung and hematology specialists. Also, reported that patient experiencing significant shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain under the rib. This persisted for some time until she presented to the emergency department found to have segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolus. Additionally, the patient experienced blood clots, chest pain, and shortness of breath due to extreme pain. Hypercoagulable work-up pending. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) with result of negative. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events occurred in a plausible temporal relationship.

I fell forward and sustained bruising to my right cheek and temple.  I will be reporting another report regarding the second dose with adverse reaction that is the same but required EMS and Emergency Room visit. Approximately 3 hours after injection I was getting ready for bed (as I work nights). I was talking with my daughter and I stood up and remember waking up on the floor. Bruising to the right cheek and temple. I did not seek medical attention and went to bed. I had no further episode but remained dizzy for several days.

At 1208 on 1/20/2021 pt received 2nd dose of COVID Pfizer vaccine. Immediately after vaccination, pt experienced unusual taste in mouth, flushing, and feeling of heat in chest.  At 1232, pt noticed flushing on arms and feelings of heat and pins and needles in both arms, hands, chest, both feet, and back. Sensation was persistent, so at 1301, 50 mg of IM Benadryl administered to RD by NP. By 1320 flushing on arms and chest subsided, feeling of pins and needles persisted but was not as severe as initial reaction. By 1345 flushing on arms returned, pins and needles sensation worsened again in all locations noted prior, spread to scalp, and tingling sensation occurred on lips. Pt communicated with Dr advised to stay under observation, but transfer to ED not medically necessary. At 1415, pt was advised to go home with supervision of partner and monitor symptoms from there.

                                                I had an immediate reaction to the covid vaccine within 30 seconds after the injection.  I felt a warm sensation after the vaccine in my deltoid muscle then felt it go up both my ears, around my head.  I then felt the same warm sensation in my abdomen, followed by buzzing of my entire body with light headedness.  I could breath, I could talk, but I had an urgency for others around me to know that I wasn?t feeling well and something was not right.  I asked my colleagues if someone could take me to the ER for monitoring.  They immediately put me in a recliner and elevated my legs.  This did not relieve my symptoms and asked to go to the ER.  I got to the ER and laid on the stretcher with continued increased buzzing sensation especially in my finger tips and arms.  My vital signs were 148/88 and HR 88 (elevated from my normal of 100-120/60-70, HR 60s).  The buzzing turned into a sensation in my arms that rumbled erratically.  I thought something bad was about to happen and that my blood cells would burst. Then I also felt icy cold in my arms and my gut.  Next what happened were teeth chattering shivers.  All these symptoms occurred in a matter of minutes.  They started an IV, drew blood, gave me Benadryl and ran IV fluids.  My vitals did not reflect what I felt inside, but as symptoms let up, my VS returned to normal.  As quickly as the symptoms started, they eventually calmed down and I was able to leave the ER in 1.5 hours to go home. I was very scared.  The ER doctor thought I had a hyperimmune response to the vaccine.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 11Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism and back pain. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), ibuprofen and ergocalciferol (VIT D). The patient previously received 1st dose of BNT162B2 on 20Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization (left arm, lot number: EH9899). After receiving second dose on 11Jan2021 the patient was feeling tired but also edgy, nervous, anxious, unable to focus, some headaches. Discovered 18Jan2021 that blood pressure was much higher than normal and associated with the way I was feeling. Had to go to primary care to have medication prescribed. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. Patient was not pregnant. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19 (Nasal swab), on 13Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 both test results were negative. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                61 yo F with history of bilateral lung transplant 6/23/17 presented to ED on 2/4/21 with chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath, nausea and diarrhea for past week since receiving since receiving COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 1/28/21. Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Blood pressure high diagnosed a couple years ago. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) for COVID-19 immunization on 29Dec2020 and unspecified flu shot last fall, she thinks in Sep or Oct2020, but she has never had problems with those. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient called and said she had reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 12 hours after her second dose and wanted to report it. She said also this past weekend, on Sunday, on 24Jan2021, she started to develop a localized rash that has like a border to it. She added that she got her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021 at about 01:30 PM in her right arm. She said that she woke up the next morning, 20Jan2021 at 03:00 AM with a high fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and rapid heart rate. She said that the high fever that started the temperature she took was 103 initially, she says she took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and it came down to 101, and the next day it was probably 100 most of the day, then it broke that evening. She said the Tylenol, the dose was the extra strength, unknown if it was 500 mg, they were capsules. She says she normally doesn&#39;t keep it around, the in-house nurse suggested it so she went and got a sample thing and took a couple doses, she doesn&#39;t have it with her as she is at work and is not at home. She said that the nausea and vomiting subsided after the first day or second day, she had the on and off fever and slept most of the day both days. She said that she doesn&#39;t have a fever now. She said that she doesn&#39;t have her exact heart rate from when she was having the rapid heart rate, she just felt it in her chest. She added that the only reason she said anything was because she called in sick last week on an unspecified date in Jan2021. She said that the rash started developing after that and it is now probably the size of a 16 oz or 60 oz cup, unable to clarify number with caller, she said that it is definitely big but it doesn&#39;t bother her, though she is concerned it is there. She clarified that it is a couple inches in diameter and kind of looks like the state of (State Name), on her injection arm which was her right arm. She said her arm is not sore now, it was after the shot on an unspecified date in Jan2021, if she pressed where the injection was it is still a little sore. She said that the hospital said to report it. She said she also has a concern if she should she get another shot if they decide this is needed for more than two vaccinations. She said that she knows they are still gathering information at this point, so she thought she should better turn in, hopefully there will be solution later on. The outcome of the events localized rash, dizziness, heart rate increased and sickness was unknown. The outcome of the events fever, nausea and vomiting was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021 while the outcome of the event vaccination site pain is recovering.

                                                Increased heart rate following second dose; they took her blood pressure which was 193; she feels a little lightheaded still; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 61-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm shoulder (as reported) on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included high blood pressure from 2017 and ongoing, open heart surgery in Aug2017 (for 2 holes in the heart), complete heart valve replacement in Oct2017 and ongoing, &#34;pacemaker&#34; from Oct2017 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included metoprolol for thyroid condition, amlodipine for high blood pressure, clarithromycin (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN]) for allergies; all from 2017 and ongoing. Patient previously took first dose of BNT16B2 on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization and experienced heart rate increased. She was brought to the emergency room and they gave her an intravenous medication for cardioversion where they stopped her heart and restarted it to get the rhythm back to normal. Family medical history included mother and sister died from lung cancer; father died of pancreatic cancer. Heart rate increased following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine administered on 29Jan2021; onset of event was in the afternoon on 30Jan2021 while at work. Her heart kind of jumped, skipped a beat and then just took off; she could feel her body twerking. Her heart rate went up to 193 beats per minute. She went to the nurses station at work, they took her blood pressure which was 193-verified this as same number of bpm of heart rate-documented as provided. That nurse told her she should go to the hospital, so patient just left work and walked to the hospital which was a block away from work. She did not feel lightheaded, sick, or pain, just heart racing. She was again seen in the emergency room in response to this event, but was not admitted to the hospital. She was again given an intravenous medication for cardioversion where they stopped her heart and restarted it to get the rhythm back to normal. She does not know the name of the intravenous medication for cardioversion that she was administered. The only thing still ongoing related to this event was that she feels a little lightheaded still. Relevant Tests: All were good. They tested her kidneys, heart did an X-ray, EKG; tested her liver and thyroid and they said everything came back good; They said her heart rhythm was fast, and irregular, but something else was normal-she does not remember what that was. She had no further details or results for testing/investigations to provide at this time. Outcome of increased heart rate was recovered while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the batch number has been requested.

A 61-year-old female patient received their first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 20Jan2021 18:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and high BP from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine, losartan potassium and sodium fluoride (CREST CAVITY PROTECTION). The patient previously took septra and experienced allergies. The patient reported that on 21Jan2021, they woke up and brushed their teeth then at 6:40am blood with large clots gushed from their right (rt) nostril. The patient went to ER and stopped bleeding after 2 hrs. On 22Jan2021, the patient woke up with bad headache, winded, vomited, diaherra (as reported), coughing. On 23Jan2021, they went to get covid test but due to blood in their nose, they received antibody test which was negative. On 24Jan2021, the patient was still feeling bad with all the above symptoms. Then on 25Jan2021, they went to ENT doctor who cauterized their nose and stated that since antibody was negative to take the maderna vaccine since they have no antibody in their system, the Pfizer vaccine did not work. From 26Jan2021 to 13Feb2021, the patient felt same started feeling better 14Feb2021 but still have sore muscles in their shoulders and cough. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 antibody test: negative on 23Jan2021.  The action taken in response to the event(s) for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of epistaxis and clot blood which include the doctor cauterized their nose. The patient recovered with sequel from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the epistaxis and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including CBC and coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

By Friday, I went to my PCP and they noticed that my blood pressure was only 90/58 and they were concerned so she told me that she was calling my cardiologist who said to reduce the dose of my Diltiazem from 180 mg daily to 120 mg daily. She also said to take a few days off of taking the Diltiazem. I have also had a serious increase in Tachycardia. That evening I went to the ED because I was so weak and couldn&#39;t breath well. I am also retaining a lot of fluid. The lab work indicated an elevated Pro-B-Natriuretic Peptide level of 227. I am still not well and each doctor I have spoken to said they believe it is due to the vaccine. I do not know if I should take the second dose.

                                                I am retired handicap-MS.  I was doing light housework.  I started getting pain in right lung,  over course of 2  hours  pain became very severe.  Only in right lung.   Felt like blood clot or pulmonary embolism (which I had 15 yrs ago).  Went to hospital, check X-ray no clot/embolisms.   Blood work showed no clotting factor.    Was admitted 4 days.  We treated possibility of MS reaction (solu-methyl) as well as heparin in event of unknown clotting issue.    Here?s why this is strange:   If this was MS flare/relapse, I would have muscle lockup, drop foot, sight issues, sever balance issues  ...(i always have sight issues)..   with this even it was only severe lung pain.     Did not appear to be MS driven issue.  Being educated ?high analytic person,  in reflection,  My ms is very territorial,  it fights anesthesia,  colds/flus/covid when my husband had it.   My MS gets cranky when my immune system is attacked.    I suspect the second covid injection was doing its thing,  dna modification, and I had some lung inflammation and my MS compounded the reaction with crippling issue.  I was in hospital 4 days, IV fluids, heparin, and steriod IV.    Within first 36 hours the extreme lung pain disappeared and I got better.  I do have cats scan, mri, X-rays from stay.  Cat scan clear, X-ray, normal,  mri-classic ms history.  Was this Ms event?  I?m not sold as I didn?t have other normal MS flare symptoms.   Was this injection aggreviated?  Perhaps...  I?m sharing this because I think tracking auto immune disease people is important data gathering.  Feel free to call if more dialogue is necessary

A 61-year-old female patient, not pregnant, received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 02Feb2021 14:30, at a single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure, and sciatica. Concomitant medications included insulin glargine (LANTUS); metformin; hydrochlorothiazide; candesartan; glipizide (GLIPIZIDE XL) and; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) - all taken for unspecified indications with start and stop dates not reported. The patient previously received sitagliptin (JANUVIA) and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the Covid vaccine. The patient did not have Covid prior vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in a public health clinic/veterans administration facility. The patient received the Pfizer vaccine dose 1 on 02Feb2021. The patient experienced nausea, chills, diarrhea and bad chest pain could barely breathe - these have passed. Her left arm where the injection was given was very painful from the injection site to her wrist and she has been alternating ice pack/heat pad and taking Tylenol 650 mg for the pain. She can barely lift her arm over her head. She also noticed an increase in her blood sugar and her blood was really dark - she stated this was unusual. She asked if there was anything she can do or take that might decrease her arm pain. All the adverse events happened on Feb2021 and resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was reported that the patient had not recovered from all the adverse events at the time of the report. No treatment was received for all the adverse events, except for &#34;left arm where the injection was given was very painful from the injection site to her wrist&#34; (alternating ice pack/heat pad and taking Tylenol 650 mg for the pain). The patient has not been Covid-tested post vaccination.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 05Mar2021 1:45 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering. Outcome of BP dropped to 70/40 was recovered on Mar2021. Outcome of seizures recovered on 06Mar2021. Outcome of funny taste in mouth was recovered on 05Mar2021. Outcome of back pain was recovered on 07Mar2021. Outcome of bruised up was not recovered. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient provided an unrelated causality between the vaccine and event fall.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Fall is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

She stated that she had a little bit of a reaction after receiving the vaccination while there, so they were monitoring her. She has been experiencing hot flashes, sweating, and stomach aches for 2 days. She cannot get rid of hot flashes and that she has not had a hot flash in 2 years. She states that she has been down for 2 days with fatigue, that it&#39;s really bad. She is inquiring if the side effects that she is experiencing are common side effects and if it is ok to get 2nd shot.  Her second vaccine is scheduled for 17Mar2021.

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Patient presents 3/23/21 for medical monitoring of syncopal episode s/p COVID - 19 vaccine # 2.  Lowered to the floor by vaccine staff.  Patient reports symptoms of weakness, other wise states she &#34;&#34;feels fine&#34;&#34;. Two additional syncopal episodes witnessed by myself when patient attempts to change position.  Past medical history is significant for mild persistent allergic asthma, pre-diabetes, OSA, obesity and BPPV.  Patient reports history of same reaction s/p previous vaccine.  At a approximately 0837 patient was noted to have a worsening rash present to her face.  EpiPen administered via left lateral thigh at 0838.  EMS called to transport patient the ED for further evaluation.    Treatment administered: epipen (lot 0FM406, exp 02/22) left lateral thigh at 0838.    Upon arrival to the ED, patient&#39;s temperature is 98.8° F, heart rate 92-103, respiratory rate 30, saturating 99% on room air with blood pressure 164/91.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were largely unremarkable.  While in the ED, the nurse was getting ready to get the patient up to the commode when the patient started to &#34;&#34;not feel right again.&#34;&#34;  She asked her to administer the medications for allergic reaction and reports wall the 2nd medication was being infused, she felt paralyzed and unable to talk, although she was able to hear everything and was aware, she was unable to move or speak for a short amount of time.  CT head with completed at this time and showed no acute intracranial findings.  Chest x-ray unremarkable.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, heart rate 80 and prolonged QT at 470.  The patient was administered Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, Pepcid 20 mg IV, Benadryl 50 mg IV, normal saline 1 L IV.  Pt was admitted to hospital for observation.    The patient was seen on the unit laying in bed with her husband at the bedside.  She reports that she is feeling slightly better and hungry and has never felt at paralyzed/unable to speak feeling before and is very nervous about this.  She was wondering if she had a seizure, although she reports feeling aware the entire time and did not lose bowel or bladder function. We discussed that that is not typical for a seizure, but even if we did an EEG at this time, it would not be able to tell us what occurred in the past.  We discussed continue the Benadryl, Pepcid, and IV steroids for today and likely decreasing them tomorrow. We discussed the workup of syncopal episodes as well. The patient and her husband were agreeable to this plan.    Patient was discharged from the hospital on 03/24/2021 in a stable medical condition.  Patient was instructed to follow-up with her PCP in 1 week.

                                                AFib; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A non-pregnant 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 15Mar2021 at 14:00 (02:00 PM), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. One week after the vaccine on 22Mar2021 at 09:00 AM, the patient had an atrial fibrillation (Afib) event. On 22Mar2021, the patient went to the emergency room (ER) or department or urgent care and ran tests including electrocardiogram (EKG), chest X-ray, and blood work which were all normal. Now, the patient had to go to a cardiologist for further understanding of the reason for AFib event. No treatment was given for the event. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient was recovering from the event.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I experienced a slight headache  sore arm and elevated blood pressure after the shot. My blood pressure is usually very well controlled. On Monday the 29th, at about 3:30 pm, I started to slur my words. At first we blamed it on the Novocaiine earlier in the day, but I had been talking fine after it and had had it many, many times before and it was worn off. We called my doctor&#39;s office after my right arm and leg became very heavy and awkward. They told me to go to the nearest hospital. When I got there, I presented ass a full stroke. I was very hard to understand and my mouth drooped and I had very little use of my right arm and leg. They ran tests, but could not give me the medication because I was already on Eliquis. They thought they saw a small clot very high up. I was hospitalized over the next four days and improved my speech dramatically after a bad headache on March 30. The doctors go back and forth to whether it was a Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is what my paperwork says and a complex migraine. I do not experience migraines or anything like this ever before.  I did not have a real headache on the 29th. Since my symptoms, right arm and leg difficulties are still here, my Doctor believes it was a stroke. I have an appointment with a Neurologist and I have to have another MRI. I am going to Physical Therapy. My Doctor told me to fill this out, she thinks it may be from the vaccine.

                                                Patient received her second Pfizer covid vaccine on Tuesday 4/6/21. She said she had been doing yard work before she came to get her vaccine. After she received her vaccine she felt fine. On Tuesday night she started to feel some itchiness. She said the itchiness got worse over the next two days. She talked to her husband and he advised her to take Benadryl so she took two Benadryl. On Wednesday she had some soreness at her injection site. Very early Thursday morning she noticed a golf ball sized knot in her armpit. She said it was sore and if she rubbed it, it felt like it was pushing into her breast. She said it felt like pressure going all the way to her breast bone and along her esophagus. She ended up calling EMS and her blood pressure was up to 181/107 and had a high heart rate. She said she never had any hives but did have some throat, tongue, and lip swelling and said that her throat felt raw. The EMS gave her 2 nitroglycerin tablets and 5 aspirin. She spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital. She said the hospital did all kinds of cardiac tests on her and everything can back clear besides a leaky heart valve. She said she is feeling much better now and that the hospital was not sure if it was a reaction to the vaccine, something else, or a combination of things that caused it.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that the patient vision wasn&#39;t as good. She also had glasses to read (eyeglass wearer and ongoing) and behind her eyes they were dry one (left) mostly. Concomitant medications included unspecified beta blockers. On 11Mar2021, she got chills on the same day. Right as she got the shot, she wanted to vomit also and got shaky. On 12Mar2021, she woke up with whistling in her breathing for a few minutes then it was done. At the same moment, her eyes were changed eventually. She had mucus in my eyes as her vision wasn&#39;t as good and behind her eyes, they were dry one eye (left). So, watching TV wasn&#39;t as good and became bothersome. She later noticed, the black in here eye was taken up most of her eye (as if her eyes were dilated). Her eyes and hearing were sharp also now sharp as she was reading better (without my read glasses) and had to turn down the volume in her TV. She also felt like she was getting hemorrhoids for a few days but then it went away. She also had black stool, then constipation (harder stool) eventually went the day right after the shot (12Mar2021). Then around 5pm, she had feeling like she had too much sugar and was dry which she needed water. Once she sat down, her living room door seemed like it was so much further away, stairs the spindles were larger in size, it was if she was high on something. It was different nothing but this injection. She was also experiencing a feeling of peace and calm. As if nothing was wrong, no stress (stressing about something) she couldn&#39;t even think of- everything was gone, a calming effect. It was high feeling. The next day (13Mar2021), she had a super watery bowel movement then went into clay like and drier consistency but still dark (she never had stool this dark). In Mar2021, she also stated that there was a movement under her skin like a pre-herpes or a pre-shingles. She mentioned that she knew herpes and the movement under her skin was shingles feeling. Her skin was also extremely dry. On 17Mar2021 (a week after the injection), she woke up to my heart spasm. It was beating real fast (beating like right under her skin), no pain and heart attack but more than a heart flutter. She didn&#39;t know whether it was going to beat or stop. She also woke up with a loud whistle (louder than before) out of a dream. She stated that during the day she doesn&#39;t get the stressed, but in her dream, it was magnified and woke up in a violent vicious fury. She had 3 nights of this (uncalm coming into my dreams viciously, morbidly gross) started on 14Mar2021. The heart spasms come as a few seconds and goes away but that&#39;s happened twice which it scares her. She also stated that there was feeling of hardness in her lower abdomen and heart area (belch) in Mar2021.  The injection almost reversed her beta blockers (which keep it in the 50s) it went to 79 (same as it was before she started taking beta blockers) but her blood pressure was normal 121/something (that was a good thing). She also mentioned that her energy was so much more while other people woke up early, cleaning up -would get sleepy and a little tired. But this (injection) gave her energy. Her injection site for the first 2 weeks also had an itch, that would come up (not constant) almost like a yeast infection which had an extreme itch. There&#39;s pain was there on touch (no throbbing pain) it took over a week before it was gone. She also mentioned that the chills were off and on for 4 days. The vaccine also did something to her weight as she was expecting to lose weight, but she didn&#39;t. One day, she gained 3.2 pounds then the next day lost 3 pounds. Her tooth also broke (but no pain in her tooth) even she had a sensation of her teeth being weak which she could feel it. Her tooth broke eating a tortilla chip and that&#39;s weird. She wanted to know if other people had called in with the symptoms that she had experienced. The patient recovered from breath sounds abnormal and constipation on 12Mar2021; cardiospasm, chills and vaccination site pain in Mar2021 while the remaining events were unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. Information on the lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 61 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; NDC number 59267-1000-01) on 29Mar2921 at 14:15, in left upper arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same date or within 4 weeks. Medical history included allergic to hamsters (she found out that this one had the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and she knew she had problems with those things), allergic to prednisone (crazy rash, itching), allergic to a lot of different things, sinus infection. Family history included allergy (the whole family had allergies). Concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotics for sinus infection (but it had cleared up by then) and unspecified allergy shots (but not a vaccine). The patient just wanted to report that she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Symptoms began minutes after getting vaccine. The patient experienced getting lots of saliva started with a couple of minutes of getting the shot, tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing, heart rate it got faster, started getting confused, shaky, wheezing, swelling of her throat, blood pressure dropped, all on 29Mar2021. On 30Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and neck pain but she thought that was more of a vaccination saying it was working. Clinical course of the events included the following information: the patient had to stay for a while since she had allergies normally. She started getting lots of saliva and she thought that was her body saying, she did something, not a big deal. Around 15 minutes, she was at a grocery store, she started walking around, her tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, she couldn&#39;t control her breathing and heart rate, it got faster. She started getting confused, shaky, it wasn&#39;t too good. She made her way back to the place where the injections were done, they were trying to get her to use her epinephrine (EPIPEN). She took a diphenidramine (BENADRYL) while walking around looking for her husband and then took another and was wheezing. She thought BENADRYL would have helped. She should have taken her EPIPEN looking back, she thought BENADRYL would help. They heard wheezing, they contacted the other pharmacist, who contacted EMS then they came and took her to the emergency room on 29Mar2021 in the afternoon. When she was wheeled in, the doctor met her in the hall and he said they could give her a steroid shot. The patient stated she was allergic to prednisone, she got a crazy rash, itching, it&#39;s not just prednisone, it&#39;s an allergy. She got the shot at 14:15 and she was at the hospital by 15:00. The patient thought she was there for 5 hours and then she was sent home. Her blood pressure dropped. The only one she saw was 114/39 but her husband saw it went even lower than that. At the emergency room, they had the automatic thing strapped on so they watched her until it started going back up again. The vaccine shot was probably the easiest shot she had ever had. She had never had any problems. She did not research it very well in the beginning because she thought they should be good. The patient was told to not get the second vaccine. The events also required physician office visit. Allergic reaction symptoms resolved on 29Mar2021 but the swelling of her throat and heart rate lasted about four days, until 02Apr2021. Neck pain resolved on 01Apr2021. Sore arm resolved on 03Apr2021 or 04Apr2021. Blood pressure dropping resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

It hurt; sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose at the age of 61-years old via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 10:10 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus from 1985 and ongoing, arthritis and osteoarthritis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She has osteoarthrosis throughout her body and her feet). Family history included stroke (husband died at the age of 59, he was having stroke upon stroke). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  It was reported that when she received the shot, it was given high on the top of her shoulder and it hurt. She could not move her arm for 3 days. The pain was excruciating. On the 4th day, her arm was sore, but she could move it. She had no fevers, she didn&#39;t get sick, but she just couldn&#39;t move her arm. The shot was given at at 10:10 am, and by noon she could barely move her arm. Her left side of the mouth doesn&#39;t want to work properly. Her Bells Palsy started on 05Apr2021. She was in her car and driving to the store, when all of a sudden her left eye was watering. She got home and she didn&#39;t see anything wrong with her eye, except it was watering. She could tell a difference between the left and right side of face when she touched it. Something was wrong with her right side. Her eye was not opening all the way, it&#39;s been dropping, and her lip was down. She can&#39;t smile, and when she drinks water it&#39;s comes out. The patient clarified that it was her left side that is drooping. She went to the emergency room due to Bell&#39;s palsy. She could not move her arm within 2 hours of getting the shot. The patient mentioned her whole body aches from the Lupus and arthritis, but the shoulder pain was different after the vaccine. The shot itself hurt, and she thinks the one who administered the vaccine might have hit something. There&#39;s not a day that doesn&#39;t go by that she is not in pain. Her platelets are 200, which is very low. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included activated partial thromboplastin time: unknown result, blood glucose: unknown result, computerised tomogram: unknown result, full blood count: unknown result, glomerular filtration rate: unknown result; all on 06Apr2021, magnetic resonance imaging: showed a darkened area in her brain that looks like its connected with Bells Palsy on an unspecified date, basic metabolic panel: unknown result on 06Apr2021, platelet count: her platelets are 200, which is very low on an unspecified date, prothrombin time: unknown result, troponin i: unknown result (High sensitive ); both on 06Apr2021. The patient did not recover from Bell&#39;s palsy, recovered from vaccination site pain on 23Mar2021, from sore arm on 19Mar2021 and the outcome of the remaining event was unknown.  Information about Lot/batch number is requested.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Was not feeling well; Warm sensation in chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  This 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EJ 1685), intramuscular, on 21Dec2020 at 09:30 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine location was left arm.  The patient was vaccinated at hospital, age at vaccination was 62-years-old. The patient received also varicella zoster vaccine RGE (CHO) (SHINGRIX) on 19Nov2020. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and high cholesterol. Concomitant medications included omeprazole, colestyramine (QUESTRAN), and vitamins. On 22Dec2020, the patient was not feeling well intermittently starting the day after the injection with warm sensation in chest that would go away until 31Dec2020 when the warm sensation of chest would not go away. The patient was sent for EKG that showed atrial fibrillation that she is now being treated for. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The events were reported as non-serious. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported atrial fibrillation and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2. More information regarding the clinical course, the patient&#39;s underlying concurrent medical condition are required for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I started to throat my started to feel dry and tickling, it felt like it swelling starting from the left side to the center, I started having difficulties swallowing my salvia and any fluid. My blood pressure was checked and it was elevated.  I started to have difficulty breathing. They transferred me over to the ER. They gave me IV medicines Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid (I think). After 6 hours I was able to go home. Everything went back to normal besides the pain in the left arm at injection site.   I had a telemedicine visit today with my primary care physician to follow up.

                                                heart rate of 160; severe nausea; arm soreness; muscle soreness in left arm; general fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 62-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 62 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EK5730) administered on 30Dec2020 at 01:00PM and the patient said she did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. The patient received no concomitant medications. She stated that she had no other recent vaccinations or new medications. One thing that may be important is that she did do a 7 day detox that ended the Sunday before her second vaccine dose, so her body was pretty much having no impurities in it, and she has been eating clean since then, maybe having something foreign put into her body set it off after detox. The patient experienced arm soreness and general fatigue on 21Jan2021, and on 22Jan2021 at 01:00 she experienced severe nausea and heart rate of 160 (which was reported serious as medically significant). Patient reported that after her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine she had a significant side effect that didn&#39;t happen until 10-12 hours after getting the vaccine. She did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. After the second injection her arm was sore, and she had general fatigue. She had the second dose injected Thursday at around 01:00PM, then at one in the morning her heart rate was 160, and she had severe nausea. She was that way until 08:00AM. Her heart rate was 120 probably by 09:00AM, then came down to 100, she has never had anything like that before. Her arm soreness was a deep muscle soreness to her left arm. The fatigue was a couple hours later after she got the second dose of the vaccine. The nausea started at 01:00AM, and lasted until six to eight, she did no treatment, and it improved and is still gone now. For her heart rate of 160, she had no treatment, though she probably should have gone to the hospital, but it came down. She usually runs a heart rate of 60-70, it went back to normal Friday, probably in the afternoon on the 22nd, about 12 hours after that started. The patient stated that she feels this is medically significant for her heart rate to be that high. She had contacted her primary care physician (PCP), but they didn&#39;t call her back for 4-5 hours, by then she was fine. She doesn&#39;t think that this was treated well by her PCP, and that they should have done an electrocardiogram (EKG) and follow up labs, she is changing her PCP as a result of this. She is concerned about the people who will be getting their second dose, she has been helping with these, they have patients that are over 100, they wouldn&#39;t survive that rapid heartbeat. The outcome of arm soreness/muscle soreness and fatigue was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event of heart rate increased was likely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

For the past 3 years I have been medication free and virtually symptom free.  The symptoms of the last few days are consistent with those I had during the years when my MCAD  was active.  I am concerned that the vaccine has reactivated the hyper-sensitivity of my mast cells.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 08:15 on the left arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sleep apnea from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and meningioma removal on an unspecified date, 3 years ago. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient experienced rapid heart beat, jitteriness, fatigue and sore arm on 05Feb2021 at 10:00. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events were reported as non-serious.

A 62-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982, expiration date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shingles which she contracted in 2019, about one and a half years ago, it was a shingles on her back and lower back which she stated were the worst place for shingles has attacked, it left her with severe pain in both legs; diabetes; and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included losartan, atenolol (a beta-blocker), and metformin for diabetes. The patient took the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and after about 2-4 days (Jan2021), she had a little chill and got very tired. She had to take care of herself. She was very tired not realizing it was the shot she took. She also felt like she has no energy. The patient was working from home but a lot of times, she was lying on the couch. Over the weekend (Jan2021), she had a slight pain on left arm. About a week or 8-10 days later (2021), she got very tired and couldn&#39;t even sit up. Her body was not itself. She started to feel like a bus rolling over her, like somebody took a baseball bat and beat her really bad. The patient uses her arm a lot and her hand started to feel a lot of pain. She couldn&#39;t even touch herself; it was so sensitive. She took paracetamol (TYLENOL) but it didn&#39;t work. She had celecoxib (CELEBREX) an anti-inflammatory, she thought she was maybe inflamed, but it didn&#39;t work. She had some diclofenac cream, she rubbed it, but it didn&#39;t work. The patient had shingles about a year and a half ago which was very bad. She just felt weak and didn&#39;t feel like herself anymore. She had a little bit of nausea and her whole body was really terrible. When she had the shingles, it left her with severe pain in both legs. She saw a neurologist and told her that she would have to take pregabalin (LYRICA) and it would go away. So, when she had severe pain last week, she took pregabalin but it didn&#39;t help. The patient took half of acetaminophen, oxycodone (PERCOCET) as she was not the person who takes pills, but it didn&#39;t work. Her body was so severe on Friday, it was not going away, the pain was there 24 hours. The patient has been experiencing this for 8-10 days now. She took one PERCOCET on Friday and had a slight relief and didn&#39;t took anything again. She kept rubbing the diclofenac cream, but it was not much of a relief. This morning, she has to work, she was sitting so she took PERCOCET. She is getting her second shot on Friday, 12Feb2021. She asked how she will feel after the second dose if she felt that way after the first dose, if the first shot was adequate, and if she should take the second dose. She stated that she didn&#39;t want to take the second dose. Her body felt so weak including her fingers and hand. It triggered the shingles pain in her back and felt like she was beaten up by someone. She has to lie down for the pain in her back. She also mentioned that she couldn&#39;t sit for so long as her waist and back were so painful. She was lying on a heating pad and ice and nothing was working. She even has a hard time getting up. She thought what happened was it triggered the shingles pain in her back and also left her with a problem under her feet. The shingles left her with some kind of damage when she took the shot. It was really bad. Her son was a physician and was concerned because last week, it got so bad, she didn&#39;t come out, she was in bed and bedridden from Friday to Sunday. She had no appetite, she didn&#39;t eat. The only thing that the patient had was diabetes and high blood pressure, but it was under control. She just checked her pressure and its was 130/80, and now, because of the pain, it went up a little bit, but before my pressure was like 120 something, over 68 or 72 it was always around the 60s and 70s. Since she was having this, it was a little high. The outcome of the events was unknown.

This consumer (patient) reported that a 62-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 62-years, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

That same evening may arm was hurting where she got the vaccine in the right arm, and the lymph node under her arm got inflamed. The next morning on 20Feb2021 when she woke up she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed, but that went away. The armpit swelling has continued since the day of the vaccine. Now this morning in Feb2021 she had a mucus plug and was bleeding she haven&#39;t had her period for 8 years, every two days she had something new. Patient wanted to know what had been woken up in her body. Consumer added that she read on line that patients should wait for 5months before going to their doctor about the swollen lymph nodes because they might send the person for a test, mammogram and it may say they have cancer, in the clinical trials apparently some patients has issues with their lymph nodes and when they did testing it was found they had cancer, but it was not cancer it was the vaccine.

Two days after the vaccine, while at orthopedist (for a Rotator Cuff Surgery), I began to feel dizzy.  I sat down for a few minutes, drank some water, and then resumed my therapy.  After the first set of my 4th exercises I began to get dizzy, I sat down on the PT table, then laid down and fainted for about 1-2 seconds.  My blood pressure plummeted to 60/?. EMT?s and an ambulance were called.  I was given an IV and taken to hospital.  In the ER, my blood pressure elevated to 205/121. (I think that was it.)  I was given a cat scan, ekg, chest X-ray, blood tests, etc.  All tests were normal except a very slight (by one number)  magnesium level.  I was admitted for observation and more tests where performed.  My blood pressure remained high, but I had no more dizziness or syncope.  I was given many more blood tests, imagining, ultrasound of heart, ultrasound of carotid arteries,  ultrasound ?bubble test,? nuclear heart treadmill stress test.  All tests were normal.  The only change in my health that can be attributed to this episode is the Covid vaccine.

A 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation; cyclobenzaprine, prednisone and hydrocodone; all via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated, &#34;First, I had COVID back in early December and then on 12Mar2021, I got my first vaccine and I have lot of aches and pain and very foggy brain. I was just with the &#39;chiropractor&#39; and he was just with me and I stood up and we were talking and I just got super dizzy and almost passed out, I just don&#39;t know. I missed, I can&#39;t even focus.&#34; When clarified the concern, the patient stated, &#34;When I stood up and I had been standing for a minute or two and it wasn&#39;t that I got up too fast and then I got very dizzy and almost passed out, luckily there was a chair to catch me. So, my concern is, do I get the second vaccine if I already had COVID, should I didn&#39;t had this first vaccine since I already tested positive? When I had COVID, I was very cloudy in the brain. I don&#39;t know if this is a part of side effect, I am trying to find out if I can get the second vaccine.&#34; The patient experienced kidney stone. The lab data is clear, upon checking, the blood and urine samples. CAT scan has been done and the report is clear. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

She made it home, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), and got in bed. Saturday her headache was on steroids, she had fever, and just didn&#39;t feel good. Later that day, she was so sick she went to the bathroom and she guessed she passed out. Basically, her husband said he found her on the floor after he heard a thump. He asked me what was his name. He said she responded correctly, but then her eyes rolled back, she became rigid, and he called 911. she knew 2 sets of paramedics arrived w/ambulances. They monitored her vitals and stayed until she was normal. They were willing to take her to the hospital, but offered other options for her husband and she to consider. They suggested she see her Primary care doctor (she did on 29Mar2021). Her doctor believed she should not take the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Adverse event start date was 26Mar2021 at 12:30 pm. AE resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was reported no treatment received for the adverse event. The outcome of event was resolving.

She adds that maybe she had a reaction to the chemicals in there.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient, self-reported). A 62-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6206 and expiry date: was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm left, on 10Mar2021 at 03:30 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, at hospital. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID-19, before the vaccination, however, results not provided. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19, after the vaccination. Patient&#39;s medical history included breast cancer survivor, chronic lymphatic leukemia. Patient had known allergies with penicillin and sulfa. Concomitant medications included calcium, colecalciferol (D3), macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX), multi vitamin, and ibuprofen (ADVIL DUAL). The patient previously took ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and morphine: and had allergies with both drugs. The patient reported that on 11Mar2021, her heart was fluttering and beating it out of her chest with elevated heart rate which goes up and down. She also felt her heart was racing. It was very erratic. The highest heart rate was 130 (non-sustained). It was started since morning after the vaccination and was still happening now and wanted to know that it was a normal side effect. She had a cardiac work up and couldn&#39;t find anything however, everything was normal. Her heart rate went up to 130, 140, 150 and went to 80. This was happened over a period of 5 or 6 days. She felt like she could not do anything and was lying in bed or on the couch for three days. Her white blood cell count was higher that it should be. She went to her regular doctor who did the EKG, however, results not provided. Further, she went to a Cardiologist and they did another EKG and wore a monitor for a week and did echocardiogram and blood work all results were normal. She was wondering, if this could possibly be a side effect from the vaccine because it did occur in the morning after she got vaccinated. She also reported that she had allergies to medications but not what was in the vaccine and that maybe she had a reaction to the chemicals in the vaccine. She was supposed to get the second shot of vaccine which was scheduled on 31Mar2021 and had concerned about getting the second shot because she had some allergies and now this happened. She was very frightening and thought that she was going to die. It was very scary for her. The product complaint was not reported. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. Outcome of the event Allergy to chemicals was unknown and for all other events it was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

I put a call into my patient care provider and went it to get a Coivd test that came back negative. I was told If it got worse to go to the emergency room . After the 55th hour I was back to normal.

She already has known CAD and risk factors for CVD.  It is possible, but by no means certain, that the vaccine was an indirect cause of the event.  Since the vaccine provoked an immune response, as it was supposed to, it is possible that this inflammation may have set up a metabolic predisposition that may have contributed to the event, which was 12 days later.

I was so dizzy I couldn&#39;t open my eyes without getting sick. We called ER and explained that we thought I was having a reaction to the vaccine, and their response was they had never heard of that type of reaction. I was sick all night, called my primary Dr in the am and they told me to go to ER. We had to call ambulance to take me there because I was so sick and couldn&#39;t open my eyes without having to vomit. Room spun in circles. My arrival at ER, they did MRI, EKG, blood work. My blood pressure was very high, so they connected me to a heart monitor. I had low Magnesium due to vomiting so much.  I was treated with Valium and anti-vert medication and fluids. I stayed overnight in hospital- had PT Jan 13th  for DX of Vertigo. Then referred to Outpatient PT for Vertigo.  Dr&#39;s felt it was a &#34;coincident&#34; that I got Vertigo shortly after vaccine, and strongly felt it was not related.  . Today is Jan 17th, and I am still dizzy, but feeling better. I have an appointment with my primary Jan 18th and not sure if I should take the 2nd dose. That is the question.

A 63-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176/expiration date) dose number 2 intramuscularly on 08Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital. Medical history included severe allergic reaction to pecans and tinnitus. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (dose number 1, intramuscularly on the left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced tinnitus, sinus infection, and stuffy head after the first dose. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks and no other medications were taken within 2 weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post-vaccination. On 08Jan2021, after the 2nd dose, the patient experienced itching across shoulders/back of neck and sl nausea. She took Benadryl which relieved the itching. She went to bed and had onset of body aches, chills, and sense the she couldn&#39;t get a good breath. She felt like there was a tight band around chest. Her O2 Sat was 95% - 98%, with pulse of 101-129, T max was 101.8. The symptoms were lasting about 6 hours. In the morning, the patient took Aleve and Benadryl. Most symptoms were alleviated. She took those meds scheduled for 48 hrs. She noticed that if she tried to push past scheduled time, the itching started to return, so she just kept the meds scheduled for 48 hours. No other symptoms after that. She added that she had tinnitus, and she noticed that both injections made that worse. It was not yet subsiding since last injection. The patient also received Tylenol for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021.

                                                I was okay during the 30 minute observation period, and was discharged.  Between 1 and 1:30 am, about 15 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up from my sleep suddenly, with an acute episode of chest tightness, cough, severe running nose and lacrimation.  I did not have hives or lip/throat itching or swelling. I felt a little warm in the face. I took Ventolin inhaler two puffs twice 30 minutes apart &#43; Aller-flo nasal sprays. I began to feel a bit better and then took Benadryl 25 mgms (because of my history of Angioedema) around 2:30 am. I feel better now, which is 12 hours after onset of episode, but had to take Ventolin inhaler this morning for a bit of chest tightness. I do not have a history of asthma, but have had seasonal allergies in past years. But if this is seasonal allergy, it is very unusual, since I have never had an acute episode like this without any early milder symptoms. And I haven&#39;t needed Ventolin in a couple of years. I am now concerned about taking the second dose.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 24Dec2020 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, ongoing allergies. She was asthmatic and believed that the virus would have affected her differently if she didn&#39;t get the vaccine. If she was to catch the virus and didn&#39;t have the vaccine she may not have come out of it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient denied getting any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. Received the COVID vaccine at her workplace. The patient got COVID virus on 07Jan2021. It was also reported that the patient lost a lot of weight, but still plump, coughing, tightness in chest, upper chest tightness with post nasal drip, like the flu, body aches, all on an unspecified date. Emergency room visit needed for the events (body aches, runny nose). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid PCR testing: negative on 04Jan2021, positive on 07Jan2021, rapid COVID testing: negative on 01Jan2021. The outcome of the event (got COVID virus) was not recovered, of other remain events was unknown.  Clinical course: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Dec2020, and a couple weeks later she got the COVID virus (07Jan2021). Mentioned she lost a lot of weight, but still plump. Probably be in the hospital now. Still had some coughing, tightness in chest, but it&#39;s not as bad. Upper chest tightness with post nasal drip, like the flu, runny nose in throat that goes down into the lungs and when it goes down she coughs and hacks to get rid of it. Went to the doctor office on the 01Jan2021 and did a rapid test and it was negative. Then on 04Jan2021 she did another PCR Covid test and it was negative. On 07Jan2021 she had symptoms and was insistent on getting another test since having body aches, runny nose. Got the re-test and it came back positive when she went to the emergency room. Got the PCR test. The patient thought that the way they were testing is how it&#39;s spreading. Did the testing on the 04Jan2021 and they used a swab bigger than a cue tip, it was huge and couldn&#39;t get far up enough instead of the tiny ones. On the 07Jan2021 at her job, emergency room, they had the tiny ones and was able to go further up and that&#39;s when she tested positive. Mentioned using salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) nebulizer, over the counter cough syrup, prescription azelastine hydrochloride;fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) nasal spray, and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED). When has the dry cough she uses the ALBUTEROL nebulizer with the machine and vials at home and that slows down the coughing a lot and the other stuff with the lungs. Not taking any steroids. Using SUDAFED to stop the runny nose from post nasal drip from going into lungs.

I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

On Sat. around 5:00 PM she was standing at her flat-top stove cooking dinner.   A wave of very extreme fatigue came over her, so she leaned over to turn off the burner.  When she did this, she passed out leaning forward with her hand on the burner and touching the frying pan.  When she came to, she went to the couch and laid down - not realizing for 10 minutes that her hand and right breast were burned.

                                                Starting a couple hours after vaccination, I began to feel unwell, overall poorly, nothing specific.  Went to be early at 9:30 and awoke at one a.m.on February 26 with splitting headache.  Could not get back to sleep well and felt terrible all that  day with headache, nausea, and foggy thinking, not funcional after about 2:30 p.m.  Took Ibuprofen at 3 p.m., called doctor and went to ER at Medical Center.  Was seen at ER a few hours later.  Slept some in waiting room. Had sore throat, the worst splitting migraine type headache ever, and was extremely foggy headed, couldn&#39;t process thoughts, eyes had difficulty focusing, nausea.  My temperature was a little high for me, I am normally low and it was 99.  My blood pressure is usually low and it was 105/59, pulse was 82 and respiration was 16 with 96 % Oxygen Saturation. They did tests and had an ophthalmoligist give me an exam also.  They said I could go home with the same meds they were giving me in the hospital since they were working to alleviate my painful headache, 600 mg of ibuprofen, reglan and benadryl.  Before I left they gave me the potassium chloride. I am continuing my medications today, two days after my vaccine.

A 63-year-old female patient (mom) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Feb2021 (reported as in the first week of Feb2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Reporter (patient&#39;s son) received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday and wanted to know if this vaccine could cause blood clot. He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet. They did test for blood clots, they did an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Feb2021, it was positive for blood clots (blood clots in the lungs). When she was admitted her oxygen was 85%. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot and batch number has been requested.

When she got to the ER- they had to use the old blood pressure cuff to get her blood pressure because it wasn&#39;t coming up on the machine- the kind where you pump it up and watch the needle, they said it was 58/38. patient states that they asked her about the rash that was all over her body in 2021; caller reports that she did not have a rash when she called at 4 PM. patient describes the rash as an extremely red sunburn rash- like you got really bad sunburn, most of it was on her torso, she also had it on legs on 13Mar2021. patient mentioned she remembers them taking off sock and her toes were purple on 13Mar2021. She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu. Saturday (13Mar2021)- She woke up and had the worst Charlie horse between ankle and calf- took forever to walk Charlie horse off. Really sharp Charlie horse. Even had less energy today. Really nauseated. patient reports that yesterday and today, she is just tired. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her body catching up on sleep or she&#39;s just tired; she will find out today when she goes to doctor. Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

                                                blood pressure went up over 210/110; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for herself. A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EN6205/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Mar2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 63 years old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included high blood pressure. The patient had known allergies to sulfa drugs and  sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included olmesartan medoxomil 20mg, naproxen, and fexofenadine.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 09Mar2021 at 03:00, the patient experienced blood pressure went up over 210/110. The clinical course was as follows: within 3 days of having the vaccine, her blood pressure went up over 210/110 (as measured by EMT).  The patient was on blood pressure medication but have never had a blood pressure reading that high before. One reading during that same day was 247/100 but dropped to 160/90 when she took a second reading.  The patient took blood pressure medicine but remained high. The event blood pressure went up over 210/110 was considered serious (medically significant). The event resulted in an Emergency Room visit. Treatment was received for the event blood pressure went up over 210/110, which included additional blood pressure medication and diazepam (VALIUM). The outcome of the event blood pressure went up over 210/110 was recovered on an unspecified date in Mar2021. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night.; When probing for specific event information she reports it&#39;s kind of like she coughs a little more and she is a little more short of breath and it&#39;s happening more often; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 63 years, via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 04:06 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma, hysterectomy, dark chocolate or red dye (she starts coughing and has an allergic reaction and shortness of breath), bursitis (in her right). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin, experienced allergy and had really ad hives (several years ago) she was given a cream to put on. She had to get another medication and she doesn&#39;t remember the name. That medication made her dizzy and she couldn&#39;t even get out of bed so they had to half the dosage. When she had her hysterectomy she learned she couldn&#39;t take any types of &#34;cillins&#34; medications. The patient had been watching her heart rate with a device and since getting the Covid 19 vaccine she&#39;s noticed her heartrate was always higher than it normally is. Her heartrate was going crazy, the device was not recording right. She reports that for the last 2 days the device has been telling her she has possible atrial fibrillation. This is worrying her. She doesn&#39;t feel anything different. She was usually hyper. Her resting heartrate was higher. Normally her resting heartrate was in the 80s (beats per minute) Now it&#39;s going up to the 90s (beats per minute) then her heartrate drops to 40 something (beats per minute) Then the device said her heartrate was 118 and 107 and she&#39;s not even doing anything. She hasn&#39;t even worked out yet. She doesn&#39;t like to take medicine. Medications don&#39;t work out with her. She had a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night. It was reported that she feels fine. She has no other symptoms. She&#39;s been reporting online. Clarified she&#39;s reporting online through the V check through the CDC. She&#39;s been trying to get the Covid 19 vaccine forever. She did research on all the Covid vaccines and she felt more confident with the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter was against the Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter thinks the vaccine was just going to kill her. She reports she was healthy and she works out 6 days a week.  She recently tried to get a CT scan for her heart. Her husband&#39;s cardiologist recommended her husband have a CT scan of his heart and she decided she needed a CT scan too. She&#39;s also watching her heartrate on her watch. Her husband&#39;s heartrate is completely normal and stable on the device so she knows the device isn&#39;t messed up. It was also reported that the device will tell her she has too much muscle movement and she&#39;s standing completely still. Then she&#39;ll get the device to record her heart rhythm and it goes sporadic. The device tells her 90 beats per minute at resting then over 100 beats per minute. Her heartrate on the device was going up and down a lot. When she&#39;s been watching the device record her heart, it looks like it&#39;s going crazy. Her heartrate goes way up and way down like in the 40s (beats per minute) She noticed when her heartrate is in the 40s (beats per minute) and she&#39;s never had her heartrate go down that far, it&#39;s really really weird. She thinks maybe she&#39;ll get back to normal. She keeps watching hear heartrate. She reports she noticed her heartrate right away on Saturday evening after she received the Covid 19  vaccine. Her heartrate was higher than normal for resting, it was in the 90s (beats per minute). Her resting heartrate is usually in the 60-80s (beats per minute) and it was the in 90s. Now the device says possible atrial fibrillation. It was further reported that she received the Covid 19 vaccine in her left arm because she has bursitis in her right. If she hit her arm the second day after the Covid 19 vaccine, her arm would hurt. Her arm felt better the next day. She clarifies, on Sunday, 28Mar2021, she noticed her arm felt like a bruise and that was it. Then the next day on Monday, 29Mar2021, the feeling was gone. She didn&#39;t have any redness. The outcome of the events her arm felt like a bruise and arm would get hurt was recovered on 29Mar2021, irregular heart rates, dyspnea, cough was not recovered and unknown outcome for has possible atrial fibrillation.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER8733), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 01Apr2021 08:45 (at the age of 63-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant. Medical history included exercise-induced asthma, SVT (Supraventricular tachycardia). Concomitant medication included sotalol. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin and diazepam (VALIUM) and had allergies to both. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccine on 01Apr2021 (08:50), the patient experienced a rush through her body from feet to head, very rapid heart rate (fluttering) which lasted approximately 1min, tongue-tingling which lasted approx. 8 hours. Woke up around 3:30 am on 02Apr2021 with a rapid heart rate. She notified her PCP and cardiologist&#39;s office that morning. There was no treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from the event tongue-tingling on 01Apr2021 16:50. The outcome of the event rapid heart rate was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and known vaccine safety profile, the causal association between the event of a rush through her body from feet to head, very rapid heart rate (fluttering) is assessed as unrelated to the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 and more likely due to the possible contributory effects from patient&#39;s medical history and/or concomitant medications. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4; was not able to walk at first; her arm was cold; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 63-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 08:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included high blood pressure that was diagnosed 2-3 years ago, diabetes; she was prediabetic, heart;cholesterol has been high for about 30 years; since she was in her 30s; all from an unknown date and ongoing. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 63-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no prior vaccination in four weeks. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin taken for blood cholesterol and takes 20mg once a day prior to stroke and in the hospital they increased it to 40mg once a day and ongoing; ramipril taken for blood pressure and she was prescribed with this medication for a while prior to her stroke. It was discontinued in the hospital. Stated that she did not take it everyday because she was allergic to it; and sitagliptin (JANUVIA [SITAGLIPTIN]) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and stated that she has been taking for quite a while. On 24Feb2021 she had her second shot. She said that everything was fine that morning; that afternoon her arm was sore. Stated she thought nothing of it. That evening she entertained guest. They were saying she sounded different; they said her speech sounded slurred. She had gotten her vaccine at around 08:00. Again, she didn&#39;t think anything about her speech. On 25Feb2021, she got up and did some laundry going up and down the steps. Stated that it was difficult because her arm was still sore. She cleaned the house. At around 15:30 she was doing bills and noticed that her writing looked like a baby&#39;s scribble. On 26Feb2021, she noticed that her left arm was weak and was told by her doctor to go to the Emergency Room where they told her she had a stroke. She added that it seemed like her arm was cold for a number of weeks. Stated she was the type to wear t-shirts in the winter because she was always hot. During those weeks she was wearing heavy clothes and was under blankets. She was just now starting to feel more like herself and not so cold all the time. The patient was unable to recall time frame when this symptom began. The events did require a visit to emergency room and physician office. The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events from 26Feb2021 to 01Mar2021. During hospitalization, the patient saw a cardiologist, neurologist, her primary care provider, and the hospitalists who all said it was very suspicious that her stroke happened right after her vaccine. Before she got her second vaccine, she was doing embroidery and everything she normally does; nothing was wrong. They did a CAT Scan that showed nothing. Then the MRI of the brain showed a Pontine Stroke on 26Feb2021. Cardiologist put a heart monitor on her and could not find anything. They were looking for A-Fib or something like that when she was on the heart monitor in the hospital; but it never showed anything irregular. She had a loop recorder implanted to monitor her heart and they haven&#39;t found anything wrong on it. She had heart tests, carotid artery tests, ultrasound of her heart and nothing was found on those tests. They pretty much told her in the hospital that they couldn&#39;t find a reason for her stroke. She kept asking about the vaccine. They did not rule it out as a cause, but they also did not say it was the cause. All the doctors said they could not pin her stroke on the vaccine. They stated it was suspicious and that they had seen 2-3 other patients with a similar situation. One of the doctor&#39;s told her he would not rule it out. They did an ultrasound of her carotids and heart and did not find anything on those tests that would have caused her stroke. She was having lasting effects related to her stroke. Her arm was still sore at times, stated it was a different kind of sore and could be related to all the therapy she does now. The lingering effects after stroke was reported as she was not able to walk at first. She&#39;s been doing therapy focused on her left side. Stated that her left side was the dominant side and she cannot write or type. She couldn&#39;t do the report online due to the difficulty with typing. She wanted to make sure this was reported. The patient has been doing therapy for 7 weeks, twice a day; and stated she likely still has months more of therapy to try and get her left side back to normal. She said that simple daily duties are difficult. The patient also stated that she was prediabetic before her hospitalization with her number (A1c) usually being 6.5-6.8. She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4. She doesn&#39;t know what made it go up. Then states she doesn&#39;t know if the vaccine made it go up or not. She has a follow up with the neurologist soon. The patient also reported medications she has been taking since her stroke and hospitalization; but not prior to her vaccine which included Amlodipine-Benazepril:  5-20mg once a day and Aspirin: 325mg once a day. The patient stated that stroke and heart problems do not run in her family. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EC1284), via an unspecified route of administration administered to left arm/deltoid on 29Dec2020 13:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a research medical facility; and received warfarin sodium (COUMADIN, strength 2 mg), oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date in 2017 and ongoing at &#34;3 1/2 tablets once daily in the evening at 5:30pm (total 7mg)&#34; for metal heart valve. The patient&#39;s medical history included had the surgery (for her metal heart valve), about 01Mar in 2017 (about 4 years ago) and so she thought she had been on Coumadin for about 4 years, had been on the 7mg dose for over a year; and has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin for the metal heart valve. Denied illness. Denied family medical history relevant to event. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Shingrix vaccine in past and remenbered she had the usual side effects from it, had mild symptoms. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines the same date of the Pfizer Suspect or 4 weeks prior. On Jan2021, the patient experienced scratched arm and bled through 3 shirts, it kept bleeding. On 04Jan2021, her international normalised ratio (INR) was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2). The events did not lead to emergency room visit, however led to physician office visit. The events were reported as serious medically significant. The nurse got the first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 29Dec2020 because she is a healthcare provider. She wanted information on increasing INR. The nurse has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin. Her INR was typically 1.7 to 2.3. She reported her last INR, before the covid-19 vaccine was given, was &#34;some time ago&#34; but it had not varied much over the years. Normally she got her INR run and it was about 2.  She had to be scheduled for her INR on the 04Jan2021 and it was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2) and they asked about anything that may have changed and the only thing was that she got her first shot. The nurse reported not having any changes in her medications, food, or life style to account for the change, other than receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient stated that it could be a serious problem if she had an accident or fell and started bleeding. A normal person&#39;s lab result is between 1 and 2, but they like to keep people with the metal heart valves between 2 and 3. She had been bleeding. She had barely scratched her arm the other day and went through 3 shirts because she kept bleeding. This is more than unusual for her, it&#39;s kind of unusual.  Getting the vaccine is the only variant she has had since getting her last INR. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included INR (normal range 1 to 2): typically 1.7 to 2.3 on an unspecified date; it&#39;s about 2 on an unspecified date: and 5.8 on 04Jan2021. The action taken in response to the events for warfarin sodium was dose not changed. The outcome of the event INR was 5.8 was not recovered, for the other events was unknown. The nurse (patient) assessed the event &#34;INR was 5.8; it&#39;s normally about 2&#34; as related to the COVID-19 vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of International normalised ratio increased and wound hemorrhage due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.

A 64-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284; expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration (vaccination location: left arm) on 06Jan2021 09:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as &#39;none&#39;. It was also reported that patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine, and prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID. The patient has no allergies to medications, food, or other products (no known allergies). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EH9899; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (vaccination location: left arm) on 18Dec2020 18:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that patient received second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 at 09:30 am. One hour after the 2nd dose (10:30 am), patient experienced dull occipital headache. Patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL). At 10:45 am, patient felt flushed. The nurse took patient&#39;s vital signs and noted no fever, normal heart rate and respiratory rate. BP elevated 226/97 (reported at 10:30, no unit provided; normal BP: 130&#39;s/80&#39;s). At 12:45, patient was taken to ED. CT scan and lab work were reported as all normal. BP continues to be elevated. Amlodipine (NORVASC) 10 mg was given at 17:00. BP slowly came down. Twenty-four hours later, BP was normal at 137/72 (no unit provided). No additional medication taken. It was reported that patient continues to have dull headache. No arm soreness or other symptoms. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events &#39;BP elevated 226/97&#39; and &#39;felt flushed&#39; was recovering, outcome of the event &#39;dull occipital headache/dull headache&#39; was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and in absence of strong confounding factors, the Company considers the reported event blood pressure increased is possibly related to vaccination with BNT162B2.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 15:00 at 0.45 mL, single dose (225mcg) at left arm to prevent COVID. Medical history included a bout of dry mouth about 7 years ago, no other relevant medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There&#39;s no adverse events following prior vaccinations. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. From the time she got the vaccine her mouth went completely dry on 23Dec2020 and she kept thinking it would go away and she still had it. Event was reported as serious per medically significant. Had a hard time swallowing at night from the dryness. Patient had the bitter taste was also on 23Dec2020, but it went away. It lasted about 5-6 hours. Then after that the dry mouth started right after. It is tolerable but she still had it. Mentioned she had a bout of dry mouth about 7 years ago and it did go away, but she never got a diagnosis for it. Patient thought that something underlying may have triggered it again. Patient also experienced burning of the tongue, tiredness, headaches, pressure in the chest area similar to difficulty in breathing, nausea, dizziness, and a fast heartbeat on unspecified date. Outcome of event dry mouth was not recovered, outcome of event bitter taste was recovered on unspecified date in Dec2020, outcome of other events was unknown. No family medical history relevant to adverse events. No relevant tests. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The adverse events resulted in neither doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, nor emergency room/department or urgent care.   Relatedness of Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine with dry mouth and bitter taste per primary source reporter with method of assessment of global Introspection was related. Reporter seriousness for event bitter taste was not serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of dry mouth cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

At the hospital checked vitals, EKG, CT Scan, Chest X-ray, Blood work and  Potassium was low took 2 Potassium pills. I went back home on 12/31 returned to work did fine that day. On New Years day everything started back again discomfort went back to ER. I felt like force in my chest the doctor collected my information and I was placed on a low dose BP medication until I return to my PCP, cardiologist(stress test).

A 64-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EJ1685), via intramuscular on 28Dec2020 07:15 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hepatitis C which cleared in 2016, hysterectomy was done in 2004 or 2005, cyst removed from breast long ago, ongoing arthritis in left knee, urinary tract infection was treated in Nov2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She received the first vaccine on 28Dec2020. She did fine that day. She came home and laid down and rested. Her temperature went up to 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit but was resolved that same day/night. Early in the morning on 29Dec2020, around 3:30 a.m., she woke up and had a racing/pounding feeling in her chest. She took her blood pressure and it was 158/86, heart rate (HR) was 83. She felt really funny. She hadn&#39;t been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, so this was high for her. She took her blood pressure again about an hour later and it was 165/95, HR 73. She took it again about an hour later and her blood pressure read 180/98, HR 77. Her heart rate stayed in the normal range, but the force felt really strong. She did go to the emergency room around 5:00 am on 29Dec2020. She told them what she was experiencing and that she had received the COVID-19 vaccine. About the time she got to the hospital, her blood pressure was starting to come down. An EKG was done and they drew bloodwork. Her potassium came back a little low-they didn&#39;t tell her how low or what her level was. She was given 2 potassium tablets which did help. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the potassium she was given. It was given to her at the hospital. She was also given a sheet to monitor her salt intake, which she already does that. She confirmed she was not admitted into the hospital, she was discharged from the Emergency Room. She felt pretty good. She didn&#39;t go to work that Wednesday, 30Dec2020, but she went to work on Thursday, 31Dec2020. On 01Jan2021, the same thing happened to her again. She had elevated blood pressure, forceful beat. She went back to the ER early in the morning, around 5:00 am, on 01Jan2021. Her pulse stayed within normal range, but she had such a forceful beat. She informed them that she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point. They wanted to make sure she wasn&#39;t have a stroke or heart attack, so they did their normal procedures to rule this out. They did 2 EKG&#39;s, 2 sets of labs, Chest X-ray, CAT scan and everything came back normal. She had a discussion with the physician that saw her about what she was experiencing and the physician was asking her about having anxiety. Caller explains she has never really had problems with anxiety before, but she can&#39;t say she hasn&#39;t had it. Being around COVID patients and getting the shot, sometimes anxiety can be there. The physician wanted her to try a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. She was to only to take a half dose by mouth, if her top number (systolic blood pressure) was between 140-160. Caller clarifies when she means half of a dose, the dose equals 12.5mg. She was instructed to take this 12.5mg dose until she saw her PCP. So, she did this and called her PCP and wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment to speak with a provider until the following Wednesday, 06Jan2021. She did a tele visit with her provider and let her know what had happened and that the half of the pill will only bring her top number (systolic blood pressure) to 130&#39;s-140&#39;s. Caller states she was used to her top number (systolic) being maybe in the 120&#39;s, low 130&#39;s. Her doctor increased her dose to 25mg. She was prescribed to take 25mg, tablet, by mouth, once a day. She confirmed she still checks her blood pressure before she takes the medicine. Caller verifies she has 2 bottles, one being the 12.5mg dose and the second being the 25mg dose. With the 12.5mg bottle, she sees refills and the date 05Jan2022. Caller clarifies both bottles are dispensed in pharmacy vials with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date. About a month prior to all of this and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, clarified as Nov2020, she was treated for a UTI. During that time, her blood pressure went up a little and kind of bounced around a little bit, but came back down. Then, she got the COVID-19 shot. She initially felt fine but later on by the time she got a chance to do the tele visit with her PCP, she was telling her about her previous UTI, and the provider put her on Cipro because it seemed like her UTI symptoms were coming back. Caller verifies she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration for the Cipro. She already took of all of that. She went to the ER for the third time on 08Jan2021 because she again felt the forceful beat feeling in her chest. She explained she felt really wiped out and worn down and she was tired. An EKG was done and they did labs. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any results with her at this time. She was taken off of work for a couple of weeks. She is currently getting in contact with a Cardiologist to make sure everything is alright. The cardiologist wants her to have a stress test. The caller states so this is where she is now. She is taking blood pressure medicine and getting set up to do a stress test. Sore arm outcome: Caller confirms she recovered from the arm soreness within that same day. Her arm didn&#39;t stay sore long at all. Racing/pounding in chest: This had improved. It&#39;s not like it was. She still has it a little bit of it now, but she is going to see her cardiologist and do a stress test. The blood pressure medicine has helped some. Elevated blood pressure: Today her blood pressure top number got to 161 and she had to take medication but her blood pressure has improved. Outcome of elevated blood pressure, racing/ pounding in chest was resolving; outcome of forceful beat feeling in her chest, UTI, potassium was a little low, felt really wiped out and worn down/tired, anxiety was unknown; outcome of arm a little bit sore, 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever was resolved on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl.

She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

On 1/22, the patient reported with tachycardia, hypotension and arm numbness. Dr was concerned that the injection was given too high on the patient&#39;s arm and potentially into the shoulder joint. Patient was directed to the LMC ED for treatment. The patient was given fluids and was discharged home. The ED provider did not believe the vaccine was given into the joint.

                                                Normal sinus rhythm but throwing PVCs; Elevated pulse with chest tightness; Elevated pulse with chest tightness; A little atelectasis in lower left lung; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 14Jan2021 09:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing does not have a thyroid; allergies/intolerance to gluten and dairy, allergies to molds, dust and some seasonal allergies; all ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine from Feb2013 to unspecified date, from unspecified date and ongoing for &#34;does not have a thyroid&#34;. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergic reaction occurred at 13 years of age with unknown cough syrup with codeine, levaquin and experienced allergic reaction occurred probably while she was in her 20s (age in years). She had fallen asleep on the couch about 9:00 pm on 14Jan2021. She woke up about 9:30 pm on 14Jan2021 and had an elevated pulse with chest tightness. She had to go to the emergency room in response to elevated pulse with chest tightness. In the emergency room they were not able to do anything other than hydrate her and all of that but it took about 12-13 more hours for her elevated pulse to come down (15Jan2021). Her biggest question was that she saw where some reactions are fast heart beat but she was kind of surprised at how long after the dose was administered that she had onset of the elevated pulse. She saw Cardiologist 18Jan2021 related to this event and the Cardiologist was a little baffled by the event. She reported event as improved, although she still has a little bit of tightness in her chest which goes in a little bit of phases. The Cardiologist told her to still take the second dose as scheduled of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She did not see her family doctor, she saw the Cardiologist only as referred after emergency room visit. She was not admitted to the hospital; she was treated and kept under observation in the emergency room for about 5.5 hours. She has a stress test scheduled for next week. She is planning to still get the second dose as scheduled of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine but she is a little scared to get it due to this adverse event. She thought the events were related with the vaccine, she had no problem prior to getting the vaccine. On 14Jan2021, pulse was 146 beats per minute which she checked with a pulse oximeter machine she has at home so she knows it is accurate; Chest x-ray: She reported that result of a little atelectasis in lower left lung was a little weird. On 18Jan2021, the EKG result was Normal sinus rhythm but throwing PVCs. She reported she knows her thyroid lab is normal because it was checked in the emergency room during visit starting 14Jan2021. The outcome of the events elevated pulse with chest tightness was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had severe COVID and was hospitalized on Dec 7,  I was in hospital (non ICU setting) for 5 days and had O2, remdisiver and dethemethzone IV.  I recovered fully, and have felt very good since mid January.  My reaction after my 1st dose of vaccine on Feb 25  started 20 hours after shot.  Worsened through the day and I got sicker at 24-36 hours, and then stayed in bed another day.  Symptoms were identical to my bout with COVID:  chills (no fever),  nausea, aches in joints and muscles, fatigue.  They were quite significant==I could not be out of bed.  As it went along I also developed the feeling in my chest like COVID--tough to take deep breath, chest hurt---but my O2 readings were fine.   Recovered after 48 hours, People who have had COVID should be aware that they will have a significant response to the vaccine on the 1st does.  I am questioning having a second dose I have not reported this to my doctor

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is patient). A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6204), intramuscular, administered in right arm on 08Mar2021 14:10 (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, arthritis, stenosis of neck and spine, allergies to dust and cleaners (when she cleans, the bottom of her neck swells up huge); all were ongoing. She has very high cholesterol, she believes it was close to 400 the last time it was checked and that&#39;s why she was given Repatha which brought it way down, but she doesn&#39;t know if she can take the Repatha again. She also has quite a few allergies - allergic to cats, sulfa, grass and Pre-diabetes. She has a fair amount of allergies. Her doctor thinks she has some asthma because she has had a little trouble breathing at different times, but she doesn&#39;t have an inhaler or anything. She mentions asthma and allergies run in her family. The patient also stated that a majority of her life, has had low blood pressure until about 9 years ago when her father passed. States that her blood pressure had been out of control for 6 months and was then put on a low dose of Carvedilol, and eventually evened out. Concomitant medications included ongoing carvedilol taken for blood pressure; ongoing loratadine (CLARITIN) taken for allergies from 1996 (has been taking for 25 years); ongoing lansoprazole taken for acid reflux; ongoing rosuvastatin calcium taken for cholesterol since Sep2020; ongoing calcium; carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure. The patient had a previous reaction to a cholesterol medication evolocumab (REPATHA) from 23Oct2020 to 23Oct2020 - her neck swelled up pretty big and she had hives on her chest, which ended up going away. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if she can take that again or not. The patient also previously took rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) 5-6 months ago and it made her legs ache really bad; esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) and had the problem; lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux. She took Nexium which was a different product with different ingredients and her blood pressure was still high the whole day. States that her doctor had prescribed another brand, which had the same main ingredient as the Nexium, and told her to double up on it one night, so she did that and about an hour later she just about hit the floor because her blood pressure shot up to about 200 over 100 and something, so she talked to the pharmacist who said that this was not a normal reaction to the ingredients in Nexium, but it happened to her every time she took it. She had been taking Prevacid for a long time but then started to get an allergic reaction. Clarified that feeling like she was having an allergic reaction after taking the Prevacid at night, was something that she has just started noticing within the last month. Wondering if the 2nd dose of the Prevacid is too much. States that she still takes this in the morning but not in the evening. States that she has started taking 15mg at night from an over the counter version of the same medicine (Lansoprazole). She explained that she hasn&#39;t had any vaccines as an adult, she never has had a flu shot. About 5 years ago, she had a bat in the house for 3 days and the bat ended up hitting her in the head and forehead as they were trying to get the bat out of the house, so she ended up getting a rabies vaccine. She was wondering and hoping there were no interactions with that. With the rabies vaccine, she did have a headache. She had to get 4 or 5 shots and she did not feel well most of the time. It took a long time to pass for her to feel normal again. The caller received the first dose of the vaccine last Monday on 08Mar2021, after the shot and while waiting those 30 minutes, she felt a lump in her throat which lasted all day and the next day, but it went away. She confirms by 10Mar2021, she recovered completely. Her arm swelled up and was sore for a day and half on 08Mar2021, but that went away. She isn&#39;t worried about that. She also has a really bad headache and was very dizzy on unspecified dates. She is concerned about the dizziness. She has been driving, but about the second day after getting the vaccine, she was leaning over talking to her mom and she felt like she going to pass out. She didn&#39;t, but she felt like she was. She has been using hot packs. It&#39;s like she has a headache around her temples and the back of her head seems to be hurting. In fact, she put a hot pack there while waiting to speak to this call handler. She doesn&#39;t know if its tension or what. She didn&#39;t have hives or none of that from COVID vaccine which she was excited about, but she is so dizzy she can hardly stand. She can&#39;t get rid of the headache and dizziness. She wants to know whether or not to go ahead with the next vaccination. This is the 5th day of having this dizziness. She was thinking the dizziness was going to last for a couple of days, but its going on 5 days. Even just sitting, She states it&#39;s kind of scaring her. She was thinking it would just go away, but it isn&#39;t. Her heart rate and blood pressure seemed to be very erratic on 12Mar2021. She woke up this morning (12Mar2021) and her blood pressure was very high, but she checked it within a few minutes and was dropping low. Her heart goes fast and then slows down, but she has had problems with this in the past. The dizziness has been bothering her a lot, she has been afraid to drive. The patient had a blood pressure of 150/102 on unspecified date.  On 17Mar2021, She mentioned she will see her HCP at 2:00 PM. She has already filed a report regarding the side effects she had. She filed a report and asked if she should get the second dose shot. However, she was informed if her HCP called, they may be able to provide her with more information. She was informed her HCP could call the medical line. On 26Mar2021, she stated that the first report was filed the first week and that during the second week, more not good things have been happening. She wrote down the report number from the first report but does not have it now. Since the vaccine, she has been having different symptoms; she is not sure if it is related to the vaccine but wanted to report it. She was a little concerned because she has allergies, stating she had just tried an injectable cholesterol drug and she did break out hives and her neck had swelled. States that she has not had any vaccines as an adult, so she was a little bit cautious anyway. She clarified that she did not have hives and did not have any breathing problems when she left. Stated that later that evening and the next day had a really bad headache and bad pressure in the back of her head, which she knew was typical. States that 3 or four times she felt a rush over her body and felt like she was going to pass out. That night and the next day (unspecified date), she was having breathing problems (was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days) and her chest was tight and she was starting to wheeze, and continued for about 3 or 4 days. She kept getting an icky feeling Monday and Friday when she got up and had unwell feeling all over like she was going to pass out on unspecified date in Mar2021. States she had real bad pressure in her head and high blood pressure and felt like her heart was skipping beats on unspecified date. States her blood pressure was around 152/100 on 09Mar2021. One-day blood pressure was real low, 88 over something but that kind of went away. States all that information was already reported. The next week, she thought she was feeling better and that Monday and Tuesday felt back to normal. Stated that on Thursday night (Mar2021), she was just sitting and around 8 o&#39;clock her blood pressure spiked within a few minutes to around 184/105 and she wasn&#39;t doing anything; she couldn&#39;t get it to go down. States that she went to the ER to check everything out last Thursday.  Every night since then, somewhere around 8 o&#39;clock, her blood pressure spikes really high.  Stated she then called her doctor. Stated she was on a really low dose of blood pressure medication, stating that she had occasional problems with her blood pressure in the past but it never went that high. Her blood pressure was usually in the 140&#39;s or 150&#39;s over 90 something. States that now it is much higher and happening every night. Caller stated that Wednesday night (24Mar2021) her blood pressure started to spike every 5 to 6 hours, stating it first started at 830 at night and again at 230 in the morning. She has been feeling unwell since that shot. Her doctor thinks it may be causing inflammation. States that they doubled her medication last night and her blood pressure is still going up and up, but usually goes down after a couple of hours. It is totally uncontrolled and her doctors are trying to figure it out. States that meds have been added, including Xanax and will be going to see a heart doctor. States that this has all been since the vaccine. Caller would like to know if people are reporting these symptoms. States that it is pretty terrible, and that she feels normal and then it rushes over her. States that it is exhausting and that she almost went to the ER last night. States that she does not want to go back if she does not have to. When she filed the first report she did not have issues with blood pressure yet. Again, she had the vaccine on Monday 08Mar2021 and that the next Thursday she felt like her heart rate was really high. During that first week, she felt out of rhythm, like missing beats. Her blood pressure dropped low the first week and that just one time was around 152/100 but it didn&#39;t sustain. It then dropped pretty low one day. The next Thursday, it was uncontrollable. It was around 180 over 104 or 105 and that it kept going up, but then back down to 160/90 something. Took Xanax and went to bed, when she woke up this morning it was low, but went right back up within 5 minutes. In the first couple of days, they increased her blood pressure medicine and it seemed to be bringing her blood pressure down and she was able to go to bed. The caller stated that Monday, it will be three weeks. States that a day and a half after the vaccine, her arm was not hurting but was still puffy, but not bad. States that when she runs her hands over it, it is still sore to the touch and a little swollen but nothing extreme. She was concerned that her blood pressure keeps going up and then down. States that the blood pressure started spiking on the 18Mar2021, in the evening very quickly and was very high. Stated that this was happening every night since then until the 24th, when it started spiking every 5-6 hours; and her blood pressure medicine wasn&#39;t controlling it like it was earlier in the week, even though the dose was doubled. For one day it worked good and brought it down low but then, it wasn&#39;t controlling it anymore. She stated no relevant tests, related to this event but states that in her last 2 labs her cholesterol was high. States that it was over 300 and her bad cholesterol double or more triple. States this has been going on for many years. States that she changed her calcium to calcium with vitamin D and her vitamin has come back up. When she was in the ER they did a Metabolic panel and everything looked okay. The adverse events require and emergency room visit. The patient recovered from the event lump in throat on 10Mar2021; the events arm swelled up and was sore recovered in Mar2021; the events erratic heart rate, chest was tight, was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days, wheezing resolved on unspecified date.

A 64-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6208), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 10:30 (at the age of 64 years old), single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing thyroid (disorder) (Unspecified thyroid condition). It is the vaccines with aluminum and bovine extract that she knows that she can&#39;t handle. Caller reported that she got a flu vaccine at work and that she definitely got the flu within a few minutes of receiving the flu vaccine.  Caller reported that another time after receiving the flu vaccine, she definitely got the flu but she was unsure of the time frame.  Caller reported that she did have the flu vaccine several times but that two times, the flu vaccine definitely gave her the flu.  She has 3 brothers and that one of her brothers that she is a  caregiver for has Type 1 Diabetes. Her brother just felt like he had to have 2 vaccines several years ago and that he received the pneumonia and flu vaccines. Her brother was hospitalized within days of receiving the flu and pneumonia vaccines.  Her brother was placed in the ICU for heart patients and the medical staff at the hospital was not sure if her brother was going to live. She couldn&#39;t remember how long her brother was hospitalized for, caller stated she thinks maybe around 10 days.She knows what she knows, her 2 other brothers were also hospitalized as children. She didn&#39;t know if her brothers had vaccines  before they were hospitalized but that she would bet money that vaccines they had received are what resulted in hospitalization.When hospitalized, her second brother was not expected to live. At the time of the event, her brother was only 1 or 2 years old. Her brother&#39;s infection was so bad that the hospital sent blood to the CDC and that the CDC couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong with her brother.The hospital kept giving IV antibiotics to her brother and he lived. Her third brother hospitalized around 5 years old with pneumonia during the summer. She didn&#39;t know if her brother had received any vaccinations at that time. She just thinks the vaccines did that to them but she doesn&#39;t know that.  Someone gave her first brother the information on the pneumonia and flu vaccines he received prior to his hospitalization. She didn&#39;t have information regarding the details of the vaccines that her brother received.The facility where her first brother was vaccinated with flu and pneumonia vaccines would not give her the information on the vaccines that her brother received.  Caller reported that it was a really hard time to fight the facility for that information and she was shocked the facility wouldn&#39;t give her the requested information.  Caller reported that they wouldn&#39;t give her any medication records or anything.  Caller reported that it was a bad time for her to fight it, and that she will eventually go back and tell them they have to give her the information.Her brother that she is a caregiver for and that was hospitalized after receiving the flu and pneumonia vaccines also had the Covid-19 vaccine on 16Mar2021.  Caller reported that she had been more concerned about her brother having a reaction as he has serious health issues, including Type 1 Diabetes and a heart condition.

Patient contacted the doctor right away via phone. Her doctor, an electrophysiologist, stated not to eat or drink anything after midnight and of patient was still in atrial fibrillation in the morning they would have to perform a cardioversion, with the paddles. Doctor believed this could happen and said its a delicate balance when you put anything else into the system that it could affect persons. On 31Mar2021 at 05:15 that morning, the patient went out of atrial fibrillation and back into normal sinus rhythm. Patient only called the doctor and would have had to go in today if the fibrillation did not stop. Patient also stated that well, it was not a good thing to fibrillate for that long, with due time it can cause congestive heart failure and stated its dangerous. Patient was resting at the time of report and was relieved she is not fibrillating anymore. Patient reported that her body feels like it was hit with a mac truck on Mar2021. Heart fibrillating for 36 hours makes you really tired.

A 64-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER2613, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 1900 wherein blood pressure was high prior to her atrial fibrillation medications; A fib (atrial fibrillation) from 2016 and ongoing; and ongoing heartrate low. As a child the caller had the vaccine in the sugar cube (unspecified) and her mouth was swelling from it; and stated that patient&#39;s sister was hospitalized after receiving the same vaccine. Family medical history included mom has hypertension. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 5 mg twice a day; sotalol taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 80 mg, twice a day; and diltiazem taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 180 mg, once a day.  The patient was a healthcare worker and she has had friends who have died from covid. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect and no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient stated she had the first dose of the vaccine and had a TIA (Apr2021) and rupture of a blood vessel in her eye 20Mar2021. The TIA was on Monday (Apr2021) and she was supposed to have her second dose tomorrow (09Apr2021). She stated she may get it but she is not taking it tomorrow because she is still having residual symptoms. She asked what the length of time she can wait to get it before she has to restart. Patient reported that after she got her first vaccine she had a ruptured blood vessel in her eye the next day (20Mar2021). She put warm and cool compresses on her eye then the ruptured blood vessel subsided. The ruptured blood vessel came back again a few days later and this time it was the entire sclera. She developed blood clots in her eye and the doctor said it probably wasn&#39;t from the vaccine (Mar2021). She was supposed to get her second dose of the vaccine tomorrow 09Apr2021 but she was going to hold off for now. She then had a TIA (Mar2021) and became hospitalized because of it from 06Apr2021 to 07Apr2021. The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation but has been taking her medication religiously. She believed that the TIA was from the vaccine as there was no explanation as to why it happened. Her heart rate was low anyways from the medications (dates unspecified) but it dropped to 35 when she was in the hospital (Apr2021). The patient&#39;s primary care provide was not the attending in the hospital when the caller was hospitalized. Furthermore, it was reported that on 21Mar2021, patient&#39;s eye was super red but only on one side of her left eye. On Tuesday, 22Mar2021, caller went to see her primary care provider and they told the patient to put a warm compress and no eye drops in her eye, that helped. Then that Friday, 25Mar2021, the patient&#39;s sclera looked like her eye was bleeding and her pupil started turning a different color.  Then last Monday (Apr2021), the patient woke up and her right arm, the right side of her face, and her right knee were numb she got up and went to see if she had a facial droop and did not. The patient thought it was from her sleeping wrong, but these symptoms did not go away. The patient went to the Emergency Room where they did a CT of her head and neck, with and without contrast which was negative. The patient was admitted on 06Apr2021 to the observation unit where they did an MRI and ECHO, which were both negative and she was diagnosed with a TIA and possible pinched nerve (Apr2021). The patient denied any heavy lifting prior to this event other than normal day to day things. The patient was discharged on Wednesday 07Apr2021. The patient&#39;s face felt like its burning, she has numbness in her right finger and right thumb.

The second time the patient&#39;s eye became red, her vision was kind of blurry (Apr2021) and she didn&#39;t know if the blood was in her pupil. The only deficit that the patient has now is sensational loss in her right hand (Apr2021) and that should improve per the occupational therapist at the hospital. The caller was supposed to get the second dose of the vaccine on 09Apr2021 but she doesn&#39;t want to take it while she is having these symptoms. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient included: head ct with and without contrast: negative on 06Apr2021; MRI brain: negative on 06Apr2021; Echocardiogram: negative on 07Apr2021; speech evaluation: passed on 07Apr2021. The patient asked what the efficacy is after one dose and if a booster will be needed since she is only protected for 6 months. Patient asked if she needed to restart the series of vaccinations if she doesn&#39;t get the second vaccine tomorrow 09Apr2021. The events ruptured blood vessel in eye, blood clot in eye, sclera looked like her eye was bleeding, eye was super red were reported as serious medically significant, and heart rate dropped as life-threatening. As reported, the events required emergency room and physician&#39;s office visit.

                                                When I signed up for the vaccine, the website said that i was at high risk for the vaccine and would need to wait 15-30 minutes after the injection.  I checked with doctor re: this warning and she felt the vaccine was still beneficial but to do my research and make a decision. I received the vaccine at the Center.  I sat down as instructed. 5 minutes later, something felt off and I removed my protective visor.  A paramedic came over about a minute later and asked if i was ok.  I said that i didn&#39;t feel well.  He said that he was going to get a chair with wheels for me and at that time i must have passed out.  The next thing that i remember was waking up laying on the floor. My husband said that there were 4 paramedics in attendance.  The primary paramedic was telling me that my BP was 72/60.  An ekg was being run, an iv inserted and run full force.  they checked my blood sugar which was fine. The primary paramedic kept talking to me to check my level of consciousness.   I was there for quite a while. Not sure who the paramedics checked with, but they decided that i needed to go via ambulance to the hospital. The paramedics were very concerned that the ambulance go to the back door to pick me up so others getting the vaccine would not be frightened. I was transported to Medical Center for further evaluation. I was there for a few hours and my labwork was normal. EKG and chest xray were completed as well as cardiac monitoring.  I called doctor&#39;s office the next morning to notify her of the event. It was very scary!!!

Awoke at 3:40 am and rolled off of arm where injection given and a wave of pain and nausea and malaise overwhelmed me. I passed completely out still lying in bed (so out that I wet myself in bed) and gradually came to, still feeling horrible. Got up, changed clothes, and major chills when I returned to bed. Around 6am I felt nauseous, got up to vomit, but instead passed completely out on the bathroom floor for about 15 minutes.  Remainder of day I felt very stiff, low energy and slightly woozy. By afternoon, energy was returning (I vacuumed the house). Minimal pain in arm this time compared to previous.

I FELT AS IF I LOST MY SENSE OF REALITY.   MAYBE AKIN TO ONE BEGINNING TO FAINT.  CANNOT DESCRIBE IT ? VISION AND HEARING AFFECTED SUDDENLY ? LIKE THINGS CLOSING IN ON ME.  THEN FELT A SENSATION IN MY CHEST AROUND BOTH LUNG AREAS WHICH TRAVELED UP MY NECK.  I SAT DEBATING WITH MYSELF WHETHER TO MAKE A SCENE AND CALL FOR HELP VERSUS TELLING MYSELF IT WOULD BE OKAY.  IT TOOK ABOUT 7 MINUTES BEFORE I COULD RELAX AND NOT BE TERRIFIED OF WHAT JUST HAD HAPPENED TO ME.  I NOTICED A SCRATCHY SENSATION ON THE BACK OF MY TONGUE.  GLAD HUSBAND WAS DRIVING BECAUSE I WAS SLIGHTLY DIZZY FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  IT WAS TERRIFYING AND I DO NOT WANT TO GET INJECTION #2.

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

EMS evaluated patient on-site. Patient was hypotensive (89/60). 12-lead EKG showed sinus tachycardia, rate 102 bpm, no ST elevation. EMS transported the patient to Emergency Department for further evaluation. In ED, patient was hypertensive (155/65) with all other vitals WNL. Repeat EKG indicated NSR, low voltage QRS, with no ischemic appearing ST changes. ED physician administered 1L  saline bolus and 650mg Acetaminophen. Patient reported feeling better and was discharged with a differential diagnosis of vasovagal episode, electrolyte imbalance, and volume depletion.

A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as &#34;localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given&#34;. On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown. Her vascular surgeon said he did not believe these events were vaccine related but cannot rule it out; her Primary Care Physician absolutely believed the events were vaccine related.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

The sensation started to feel so intense that it felt like her skin was crawling. Shortly after she developed a rash and with raised, red pustules. The scratching led to bleeding and eruption of the pustules. The sensation went away after a few hours and left small scabs that are now healing.

I checked her BP three times: 12:37pm 168/98 pulse 97 12:46pm 157/96 pulse 89 12:58pm 147/93 pulse 86 Patient said she felt anxious due to her allergy history. I had her sit in the observation area for 30 minutes and gave her water.  She displayed no additional symptoms and nothing that would have been indicative of anaphylaxis.   She was vaccinated at 12:30pm and left the store with her husband at 1pm.

The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia secondary to acute CHF exacerbation. The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed 2 weeks prior to hospitalization that was noted to show a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65%. At the hospitalization, her left ventricular ejection fraction was noted to decrease to 25-30%. Left heart catheterization was performed and showed no signs of ischemic heart disease (coronary artery disease). Patient was started on Entresto 24/26mg PO BID and Toprol XL 50mg PO daily and was diuresed with Bumex 1mg IV daily and was noted to have improvement in respiratory symptoms for which she was weaned off of BiPAP 15/5 with FiO2 of 50% down to room air. Patient had repeat transthoracic echocardiogram ordered prior to discharge and was noted to have an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction to 48% prior to discharge. The only change was that the patient had the COVID-19 vaccination. Patient does not have any history of coronary artery disease or heart failure. Patient was worked up extensively for other etiologies of heart failure and none were found.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient was not anxious at all about getting it but she started having a rapid heart rate/ bounding rapid heart beat and SOB/shortness of breath that lasted about a minute. The EMT checked her out and asked her to stay longer and she did and after about 5 more minutes the same thing happened again. These episodes lasted about 1 minute and she had dizziness with it. Also she did not have any further episodes and she stayed a long time. Her concern was whether this was indicative of an allergic reaction and should she still get the second dose.

The patient arm was sore and swollen that was all now. The events heart rate increased, dyspnea, pain in extremity, and peripheral swelling was assessed by the reporter as serious (medically significant). The outcome of the events heart rate increased, dyspnea, and dizziness was recovered and unknown for the remaining events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.  She felt like she was going to faint, she thought if she was able to count back from ten she was going to be knocked out. Once she counted back she started to feel better. Like she would not faint. She did not faint often. She mentioned counting backwards from ten when getting a colonoscopy or something like don&#39;t get passed five and then knocked out, so she knows the sensation that can occur. After 1.5 hours they decided to call the emergency number and that was when the ambulance came. The ambulance service was the one who did everything for the patient. Because the patient got in the ambulance, they required her to go to the hospital, she was in a bed in the hall, by the time her doctor had looked at her, her throat had opened up and was feeling reasonably well after an hour an half.

The patient was on an IV and they gave her 125 mg of Solu-Medrol, 50 mg of Benadryl, and 5 mg of nausea medicine, phedrol the caller thought it was called. They did a good job and that helped the patient down from the most severe symptoms and she wanted to report her symptoms.  The patient has been looking around and she thought this reaction it was from the polyethylene glycol. She mentioned historically she had a minor reaction. She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication. She confirmed she visited the emergency room for all 3 of these cases. The patient was still very confused on 09Mar2021 and over the weekend, she had to rest, she was weak and fatigued. On 09Mar2021 it was first real day she went back to work. She worked and asked her brother to watch out for her. On 10Mar2021 she was starting to feel a little bit better as regarded anaphylactic reaction, she has recovered with residual effects from the anaphylactic reaction. Confusion was improved but stull a concern.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 23Mar2021 19:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing laryngopharyngeal reflux diagnosed about 5 years ago, ongoing anxiety, usually happens during stressful circumstances; diagnosed about 20 years ago and she had had the sensation of labored breathing, dry mouth, and accelerated heart rate then yes for work like with public speaking; sensitive: Sulfa drugs, aesthetic filler in her face and allergic reaction Hyaluronic acid filler collagen and she doesn&#39;t smoke and drink. Family history included daughter was diagnosed with psychotic episode and diagnosed with mental illness and it was stressful getting that under control and she was sensitive to medication and surgical procedures she doesn&#39;t tolerate narcotics. Concomitant medication included clonazepam (KLONOPIN). She reported that she was prescribed .125 of clonazepam and it was a dissolvable sublingual and she doesn&#39;t use it frequently as she has read about reliance and potentially addictive and she will take a walk or watch a boring video to try to get her mind off it. The patient previously took oxycodone hydrochloride; oxycodone terephthalate; paracetamol (PERCOCET) and she was sensitive to Percocet; and darvocet and experienced sensitive to Darvocet post surgery; and codeine, and vicodin and was sensitive to both drugs, advil and causes her stomach to be upset, shingles vaccine, HPV vaccine, chicken pox vaccine and got 1 pox from that about 15 years ago when it first came out. The only post-surgical medicine pain reliever she can take was Tramadol and more often than not she doesn&#39;t have to do anything beyond Tylenol extra strength. On 24Mar2021, 04:00, the patient experienced extreme chills, and anxiety accompanied with tight, shallow, and labored breathing. She had troubled breathing due to this. She mentioned that she went to the emergency room (ER) that morning. On 27Mar2021, the patient had emphysema and agitation. On 26Mar2021, early in the morning, she had the breathing issue that she mentioned first concurrent with agitation and anxiety like at same time with the extreme chills. The sensation of agitation was all combined together, it like hit out of the blue while she was getting ready to go to sleep. She stated that at 4am it hit her with a sudden bout of extreme chills and at the same time a sense of anxiety, it felt like she hit a wall and couldn&#39;t get a full breath. She stays up late but wasn&#39;t doing anything anxiety provoking, she thought she was reading recipes. She sat to calm herself as she was not sure if it was a reaction or anxiety at the initial reaction fueling it further so she tried to sort of lower everything in her system and was concerned it could accelerate and not subside. At the hospital, they took her in an exam room and did her vitals and she was there about 2-3 hours and it was early in the morning and at that point sometime they took a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work and at that point prior to that while she was waiting she was feeling a little better, the worst had subsided and she suggested she go and they asked her to stay since she was already checked in and to be seen. The doctor looked at the results and read the film and questioned about emphysema and she felt that was unrealistic reading as she doesn&#39;t smoke, doesn&#39;t drink and it&#39;s not in her genetic make up. The doctor told her lungs were showing a lot of air and she said maybe it was because she was gasping and they told her to take a big gulp of a breath and hold it to get the X-ray. The doctor suggested she see a pulmonologist and she didn&#39;t feel that was warranted. She contacted her general practitioner and they recommended she get the 2nd shot and had her see an allergist who also suggested she get the 2nd shot. The patient stated that she was not really overweight and doesn&#39;t drink and doesn&#39;t smoke and the allergist didn&#39;t mention but she saw in the paperwork that a side effect could be difficulty breathing. She had no swelling, body rash, dizziness or weakness. Since that episode, she periodically throughout the day, and she can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s anxiety or allergies or something but she felt labored breathing and tightness in her chest and can&#39;t get a full intake of breath. She reported that when she sleeps on her back the sensation disappears completely and when she sleeps on her side it reappears a little; 1-2 nights after, it woke her from sleep and she doesn&#39;t think she was dreaming about anxiety. She stated that she has never had anaphylactic if this should escalate what to do and she decided to go to the ER and they had her wait an additional 2 hours for a follow-up reading that was all clear, all fine, except emphysema thing which was again, she was just researching and forgot the medical term, she this it was hype aeration, too much air sucked in. Her general practitioner recommended she see an allergist for a 2nd opinion and was surprised she was up on anything and didn&#39;t mention side effect and the handout said it could be a possible side effect. She has to yawn a lotto get the air in. She does have laryngopharyngeal reflux prior and she clears her throat which is probably annoying and controls that through diet instead of taking Pepcid AC. She has had to clear her throat a lot but never had labored breathing or shortness of breath, that to get a full breath sometimes she has to yawn to get past that tightness of shallow breathing or labored breathing. On certain days she doesn&#39;t feel it and thinks it was done and she will have a spate and it happens and she thought there was something stressing and does a reality check and again it&#39;s that time of year and when she was taking her walk and walked past a certain block she started to wheeze from the pollen on an unspecified date and she called her allergist to see about getting something. She had a mask and that helped a little. Her allergies were not exacerbating on 23Mar2021 or 26Mar2021 but started the last few days and she has a wheezing cough that had an extended sort of wheeze at the end of the cough. Before her cough for LPR it was annoying throat clearing. After the vaccine, she took that walk through that one specific spot on her route she got to coughing and thinking she needs to call and get something prescribed something if anything if she gets the second shot it will address any of the side issues if they were related to allergies so don&#39;t have to contend. It was every night where she sort of feels it and she sleeps through the night so if it was tension related it subsides and can&#39;t distinguish what is emotional and physical but she was sleeping through the night and it was an indication that it was improving. She reported that when she visited her son and after she returned he told her he was unaware he had strep and didn&#39;t know it, he was asymptomatic and she had a sore throat and went to urgent care and had an exam and didn&#39;t have strep and doesn&#39;t know what it was but she was feeling better by the weekend. She was supposed to go back and everything was shutting and she didn&#39;t go. Maybe she was exposed and just had a mild thing while she was there. She was tested for Covid on 26Mar2021 and her result was negative, but they did not do an antibody test. She wanted to know if difficulty breathing was a common reaction with the vaccine, and if the side effects would be lesser after the 2nd dose since she already had a severe reaction after the 1st dose and if she should still receive the 2nd dose of the vaccine. She was concerned the 2nd shot will be more pronounced than the 1st and she doesn&#39;t want to go through that and it be more severe.  She has heard if you had that reaction you may have been exposed to Covid before and she may have been around people with Covid that had positives and she may have antibodies from an asymptomatic experience and it may do more harm than good and she should do the 2nd shot. She mentioned this to her allergist and was told if she has a similar symptoms to call and get a bronchodilator. She was onboard with that but wants to discuss it because she finds it hard to believe she was the only one that had difficulty breathing and was wondering what was the duration of this labored breathing. She was scheduled for the second dose 18Apr2021. Outcome of events sore throat was recovered on an unspecified date; and outcome of rest of events was unknown.

April 23 morning, she told us she has  severe abdominal pain, has the need to have a bowel movement, but she was defecated. She also told us that she vomit couple times already,  then she has no more energy to talk. She got into the hospital and she was announced death right after midnight at 12:04 April 25th.  Reason of death given is &#34;septic shock secondary to ischemic bowel &amp; intra-abdominal sepsis&#34;.   But it is the blood clots issue that is causing it.   I was told that after my auntie got into hospital the very next day after Pfizer vaccine, hospital later found out that my auntie has blood blockage issue that is causing blood couldn&#39;t flow to her intestines. The acid in her blood was very high, 6&#43;.  After more than 6 hours without blood to her intestines, her intestines tissues start dying and turned black color. Doctor found out about this at the night of April 23, 2021 nighttime. April 22, 2021 morning is the day my auntie got her Pfizer covid vaccine.  There is a very high chances of the Pfizer vaccine is causing the blood clots that lead to blood blockages.

The patient added that it is hard to look in the mirror. She will not get the second dose. She was not interested in taking the vaccine now.  She wanted to wait and see. It being so new and see. Her sister took it and encouraged her, and said it is necessary because they like to travel. She got Prednisone when she was at the hospital, they gave her 60mg Prednisone. Her physician didn&#39;t want to keep her on it too long and said it may cause other complications.  Her physician cut her off, she weaned her down 50mg, 40mg, 30mg, 20mg, then 10mg. When the patient noticed her face start to turn, she went to the ER. She thought she was having a stroke. The patient was not admitted to the hospital.

                                                I receive my second vaccination for Covid on January 4, 2021.  Less than 36 hours later I experience a rapid heart rate (110 - 128) and shortness of breath not related to activity.   I had anticipated body aches, chills etc and did have those as well.  Over the course of 4 - 5 days those resolved but my tachycardia and shortness of breath have not.  I waited another week to see if it would improve and when that did not occur I made an appointment to see Cardiologist because quite frankly, I was fearful of my symptoms.  My lungs remain clear, I have no difficulty taking a deep breath and my SAO2 is high 90&#39;s.  I had my annual physical 1/18/2021 and my lab work was normal as was my EKG.  I have never had shortness of breath and my heart rate was normally in the 70 - 80&#39;s range at rest.  Doctor ordered testing and the results are in My Chart.  I had a Echo/Stress/Echo which was normal.  My EF was 60% and in spite of my extreme shortness of breath on the treadmill, there was no ischemia induced.  Bp was elevated initially and during the test but returned to 130&#39;s/70&#39;s in recovery phase.  SAO2 was 97% to 100%.  I did a home sleep study on 1/31/2021 with results pending.  Doctor stated there was nothing on my testing that would account for my symptoms.  At my initial visit (1/26/2021)he started me on low dose Cardezem 120mg to address my heart rate.  My heart rate has improved with Cardezem (increased to 240 mg 2/2/2021) but my shortness of breath with minimal exertion has not.  I believe Doctor plans to order a PFT next.  Because of the timeframe for new onset symptoms and my Covid 19 vaccination, I wanted to reach out to you for guidance.  ? Second Covid Vaccination 1/4/2021 ? Shortness of breath and tachycardia 1/5/2021 ? Scheduled appointment with Cardiologist for 1/21/2021 and it was cancelled and rescheduled for 1/26/2021 ? Dr. appointment 1/26/2021, started on Cardezem 120 mg qd ? 1/31/2021 Sleep Study completed, results pending ? 2/2/2021 Echo/Stress/Echo completed, Cardezem increased to 240 mg qd ? PFT order pending ? Follow up with Doctor scheduled for 2/18/2021

                                                2 days after vaccination right thighs and right leg started to have pain similar to pain I got with polymyalgia rheumatica that I have had in past and I though it was a flare up. A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues. Traveled by car a couple  thousand miles last year and no issues.

A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EN6201, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Feb2021 at 04:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medications included tolterodine and adalimumab (HUMIRA). The patient reported that she received the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 at around 4:30. Firstly it was fine, she felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore. What concerned her was the swelling started almost immediately after the shot on 18Feb2021. She knew that was one of the symptoms. This morning and yesterday though (18Feb2021), she noticed some of the symptoms. She got a large knot that was right above the injection site. Yesterday, it was about the size of a half dollar, today it is about the size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot. It feels like an egg under the skin or a clot. Like a knot (a hard spot underneath the skin). The patient was wondering if it was something she should be concerned about because the swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area. It was a rectangle and is about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high and then right above that was where the needle went in. The large circle or knot was right above that and she was thinking possibly when she was given the injection she has never really bleed before. So, she thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm. She got no problem. That happens at times, but she started thinking if this was a clot or it was something that is right above there because it is so pronounced, and it really hurts. The patient stated that she took some Aspirin last night and is going to take an ibuprofen in a little while. She mentioned that she takes this one pill and it has nothing to do with anything.  The patient had lab work done (unknown results) that was about 3 weeks ago (2021). She also stated that she also take Humira which is a shot every 2 weeks and it said in the fact sheet that she should be concerned or be sure that she did not take any medicine that affects the immune system and Humira does weaken the immune system but she was not ask that prior to. The patient wanted to know if is that something she should be concerned about. Outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Ischemic stroke; not hypertensive, but supposedly is now.; Visual disturbances; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EM9810, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 01Feb2021 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization at a Physician office. Medical history included asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, pneumonia and borderline high cholesterol. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had her first COVID-19 vaccine on 01Feb2021 and second one is due on 22Feb2021. On 03Feb2021, the patient had a headache, but didn&#39;t think too much because it is a side effect. The headache lasted all through the weekend. Visual disturbances began 04Feb2021. She called her doctor on Monday and was seen by her doctor on Tuesday, 09Feb2021. The patient was referred to the eye center. Her headache was getting a little better. On 10Feb2021, the patient was seen at an institution, her retina and macula looked good, so she was referred to the ED. The patient was told she probably had a stroke. The patient was admitted to the hospital for an ischemic stroke. By looking at the MRI, the onset of the ischemic stroke would have been five to seven days prior, placing the onset on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, which was also the onset of her headache. There is no definitive cause of her ischemic stroke. The patient currently has an arrhythmia monitor on. MRI/MRA showed her vessels looked good. MRI showed evidence of the ischemic stroke. The patient has neurologists since being admitted to the hospital. It was thought that the headache was just because of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Causality was unknown, it was stated that they haven&#39;t found anything else as a cause. The patient&#39;s doctor stated she was borderline for high cholesterol. She was not hypertensive, but supposedly is now. The patient also had echocardiogram, EKG, manual neuro checks, and blood work but does not have the results. The outcome of the events was unknown. The has trouble reading now since the stroke.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to the vaccine BNT162B2 and can be explained as intercurrent or underlying medical conditions in this elderly patient with excessive weight (BMI=29) and underlying elevated cholesterol. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The evening after patient received vaccine, she started to develop low grade fever and urticarial rash at the vaccine site. The urticaria improved the following day, as did the fevers. Then 3/5, the fevers started again, several times per day, as high as 102 at home.  In association with the fever she has had some mild nausea, x1 non-bloody emesis last night, as well as rigors/night sweats.  She went to urgent care and eventually was admitted to the hospital for the following 9 days. During this admission, she continued to have fevers intermittently as high as ~103. She also developed more generalized urticarial rash (worst on trunk), and lab abnormalities including low platelets and elevated liver function tests. She had extensive testing, ultimately determined likely vaccine reaction, started on prednisone 40 daily and improved for discharge to home on 3/17 without fevers x48 hours and with improving labs.

The heaviest shaking was of the right arm and hand which was where the vaccine was administered. Made my way to bedroom on my walker to tell hubby I was not feeling well,  Took blood pressure which was elevated and my heart felt like it was beating out my chest, Bllod pressure was elevated and so was pulse. Shaking continued and breathing was shallow, Waited 10 minutes and retook vitals, BP and pulse up more, Called 911, Paramedics came and monitored my vitals several times which after 20 minutes started declining, Could not say conclusively if was vaccine related. Elected due to Covid not to be transported to hospital and signed off on declination, Was told by paramedics to call 911 again if symptoms reoccurred and go to hospital,  In successive days I still continue to have pin-prick feelings and numbness in my right fingers, More difficult to walk than usual,

                                                phlebitis in my Right leg; small blood clot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 66-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 09Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included many allergies. The patient has no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient had other medications in two weeks but no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously had the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL9263) on 20Jan2021 at 10:00 administered in the right arm for Covid-19 immunization. On 20Feb2021 at 12:00 (also reported as &#34;in February&#34;), the patient had a phlebitis in her right leg, a week later (Feb2021) a vascular surgeon office did an ultrasound and found a small blood clot. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The events were treated with Eliquis BID (twice a day) for 45 days. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal relationship between BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) and the event thrombosis cannot be excluded based on temporal association.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate .

A 66-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3302, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy from 2006 and ongoing, since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer in 2006 and burning mouth syndrome. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had other medications in two weeks which included unspecified dietary supplements. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took doxycycline from 2010 to an unknown date for Lyme&#39;s diseaseand experienced burning mouth syndrome. On 11Mar2021 at 02:00 PM, patient had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. These symptoms still continue. Patient stated that people were talking about the second dose being worse. Patient stated that some of the reactions in Mar2021 look like an allergic reaction. They (HCP) only have cautioned the patient about difficulty breathing in Mar2021. They were saying there wasn&#39;t anything they can do for it. Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment. If they are going to continue, patient was very concerned about following up with the second shot and asked if they can have that second shot be postponed until patient was not experiencing these side effects to the effect that she was. She completed the self-reporting on Monday (15Mar2021), but because her side effects were not going away she wanted to reach out to someone. She has reached out to her practitioner and had an appointment yesterday. Doctors didn&#39;t really know because it was all very new. She had the first vaccination shot on 11Mar2021, almost a week ago. In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme&#39;s disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn&#39;t know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn&#39;t want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well. No practitioner can recommend whether to do it or not to do it. She reported this information online to Pfizer on 15Mar2021. She provided the lot number when she reported it online. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. No treatments received from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The patient recovered with lasting effects from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The outcome of the other reported events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 13Feb2021 14:00 (lot number: EL9264) as single dose at the age of 66 years old, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, spinal stenosis, arthritis and allergies to sulfa. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included insulin human zinc suspension (HUMULIN U), metformin, pioglitazone hydrochloride (ACTOS), fish oil, tocopherol (OMEGA 3) and valsartan; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took bydureon, codeine and celebrex and experienced drug allergy with these medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 on 23Jan2021, at the age of 66 years old for COVID-19 immunization (Product: COVID 19, brand: Pfizer BIONTECH, lot number: EL3247, administration time: 03:00 PM, vaccine location: right arm). The patient did not receive any other vaccines four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The patient had a stroke with expressive aphasia on 14Feb2021 20:00. The patient was hospitalized due to stroke with expressive aphasia for 5 days. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization. On unspecified dates, the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram (CTS), laboratory test (labs), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tPA (plasminogen activator inhibitor); all with unknown results. Other tests include: negative COVID test (nasal swab) on 16Feb2021 and negative COVID test (blood test) on 03Mar2021. The patient had speech therapy as treatment for the events. The patient recovered with sequelae from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported  stroke with expressive aphasia is assessed as unrelated to the administration of vaccine BNT162B2 and can be explained as intercurrent medical condition in this elderly patient with underlying diabetes mellitus, hypertension and other comorbidities.

She wanted to report that she developed a blood clot in her right ankle. She went to the doctor yesterday on 06Apr2021. She would like to add she has no prior history of any type of blood issues. The doctor she saw thought that the blood clot and the Covid 19 vaccine could be related but would not commit to saying so directly. She started having issues about 6 days after the second Covid 19 vaccine. She doesn&#39;t exactly remember when, maybe the 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. She ignored the issues attributing them to over exercising. She reached a point where she couldn&#39;t ignore the issues anymore and went to the doctor. Caller clarifies she has a varicose vein in her right ankle and it started to hurt then her ankle on her right side started swelling. She only payed attention to her ankle when it got worse. The last 3 weeks have been awful. She would like it known that she does not lead a sedimentary lifestyle. She rides her bike 60 miles a week and walks 10 miles a week. She&#39;s always moving. This is unusual for her. The doctor she saw diagnosed her with a blood clot and he did a sonogram in his office. She has been prescribed Xarelto 15mg tablets. Take 2 tablets twice daily for the first 21 days then on the 22nd day start taking one 20mg tablet once daily. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sonogram: unknown result on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the all events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 17Mar2021 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 66 years old) (Lot Number: EN6205, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing anxiety (40 years or more), ongoing depression (46 years ago, at the age of 20), ongoing acid reflux (maybe 25 years), ongoing GERD (maybe 25 years), ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus (for 12 years), mild to moderate COPD since 2011, gastric bypass (a year and a half ago), and lost 120 pounds. Concomitant medications included bupropion for anxiety depression and omeprazole for acid reflux, both ongoing.  The patient previously received flu and tetanus on unspecified dates for immunization and both experienced hard red welt on arm (welt was hard and lasted for 5-7 days). The patient reported no side effects for 12 hours, but a little soreness at injection site on 17Mar2021 at 20:00 (8:00 PM). Her arm wasn&#39;t heavy, but she had an awareness of the soreness.  She has had life-long anxiety and depression. Several weeks ago (on 26Mar2021), her anxiety reared up, and it could have been due to a family situation. On the 9th day after the first shot, she was having a therapy appointment on the phone and talking about her anxiety, and she got a stiff neck, like an iron claw (26Mar2021 at 10:00 am). It lasted for a couple of 5 minutes and she laid down on the couch then on the floor.  Her therapist said to call 911. Emergency medical technicians came to her house and they said all of her numbers looked good.  She went to the hospital, and was in the emergency room for several hours, but she only remembers one hour of it.  She also had diarrhea and nausea on 26Mar2021 at 11:30, and it felt like Dumping Syndrome, that one can have from a gastric bypass. She was only aware for one hour at that point and blacked out (on 26Mar2021). With regards to nausea, she mostly saw bile in the bag, all she had that day was a protein drink. She was back home and the next day, she did not remember how she got home. She hasn&#39;t had blackouts anymore but feels it may be from heightened anxiety.  On 27Mar2021 at 09:00, she had no appetite, lost 6 pounds in a week, and was tired. She had headache lasted for days and days on 29Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. She is slowly improving but she still doesn&#39;t sleep through the night on 29Mar2021 at 16:00. It was like a feeling like she was resetting her surgery, like she didn&#39;t care about eating.  The also experienced back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica on 31Mar2021 at 16:00 and was constipated. She is using a stool softener and is back in her routine. She called her primary doctor and could not tell her what happened, and she went in a loop trying to get information and authorizations for her to make a determination of what had happened.  Her doctor felt like she should have an MRI. Her heart and all of her numbers looked good, as the emergency medical technicians said. Her primary doctor recommended her to get the second shot.  She had cancelled the second shot for this week, and she has rescheduled it for another date.  She was afraid that she will black out again, after the next vaccine, and is not sure if that is how her anxiety manifested. The main reasons she is calling is that she had no concerns of side effects prior to the vaccine, and a couple of her neighbors said they had read about side effects of the vaccine, but she was not worried.  When the patient started to read about side effects of the vaccine, she understood that on the 10th day, the vaccine starts to be in a person&#39;s system and that maybe is why she didn&#39;t have initial side effects, but then she had side effects several days later because the vaccine was in her body.  By day 10, the vaccine is in effect in the body and she is nervous. Her second vaccine is scheduled on 26Apr2021. The patient would like to know if there is any information on people that have had a gastric bypass. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The events resulted in emergency room visit (except nervous). The patient recovered from soreness at injection site on 18Mar2021; recovered from diarrhea, nausea,  felt like Dumping Syndrome on 26Mar2021; recovered from stiff neck on 26Mar2021 at 10:05am; recovered from constipation on 02Apr2021; and recovered from no appetite and lost 6 pounds on unspecified dates. The patient also recovered from headache with sequelae on unspecified date; and recovered from blacked out on 27Mar2021 with sequelae. The patient had not yet recovered from anxiety reared up; tired; doesn&#39;t sleep through the night; back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On my way home from receiving the vaccine, I felt slight numbness in my lips (no further swelling, etc.).  Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

Noteworthy, I had  as a precaution taken prednisone 20mg p.o  about 2 hours before the injection.  I had to take more  later that afternoon because of symptoms. I then seem better but several times since the vaccine I have needed to uses the inhaler  and take prednisone  more than I have except after an infection about 6 years ago that precipitated similar symptoms to now. Today I had a flare significant enough that except for covid I might have gone to the ER or urgent care.

A 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 at single dose at left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation/heart problems diagnosed prior to the vaccine, got the COVID virus on 18Nov2020, disoriented in Nov2020. Concomitant medications included her heart medication every day and vitamins, nothing out of the normal. Caller stated she had heart problems. The heart problems were diagnosed prior to the vaccine. Caller also stated that she got the COVID virus this year before the vaccine as well and she was off, of work for like a month. On 23Dec2020 she got the vaccine. Then on Thursday 24Dec2020 and Friday 25Dec2020 she had a reaction. She had passed out in the night, hit her head and cut herself, she was then disoriented for 1 full day. Caller stated that the last time she was disoriented like this was when she had the COVID Virus, because she had heart problems. Caller stated that she was fine now. Caller stated that she had been off, of work so much. The heart problem she had was Atrial Fibrillation. Caller clarified that she had the COVID virus this year in Nov2020, it was before thanksgiving, on 18Nov2020 she had the virus, then on 19Nov2020 she got tested and it was positive. She got the vaccine on the 23Dec2020 Wednesday then on 24Dec2020 at night she passed out and on 25Dec2020 she was disoriented all day. Investigation Assessment: No. On 24Dec2020 she was going to bathroom, and found herself on the floor, then the following day 25Dec2020 was when she was disoriented. She knew this because when she had the actual COVID virus previous in Nov2020 this happened previously. When queried outcome of being disoriented she stated that she still felt a little weird but if getting better very, very slow. The Second dose was schedule for 13Jan2021. Caller confirmed that she did have a Positive Test for Covid Previously. Her treatment at the time was in the Emergency Room, they gave her an Antibody infusion, she had to schedule it because it was actually a clinical trial. Caller was asked if she knew the name of covid test, she stated that she does not know, she only recalled that she opened her mouth and they test her that way. The outcome of the event &#34;disoriented&#34; was recovering, of the other events was unknown.

                                                I was hospitalized with a severe reaction to my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine given 2/1/21 @ 9:45.  I was discharged Tuesday evening 2/2/21.  Dr., my internist, agrees that what happened was not a vasovagal syncope (hospital?s diagnosis).   My Experience: Within say 7 minutes of the injection I felt woozy, the wooziness intensified, I got intense pins and needles in my lower legs, fore arms and hands, and less so in my face. My speech became very slowed down, slurred  and I had a lot of difficulty forming words. It was as if I was extremely drunk. After they called the paramedics, I was not able to get myself out of my car or walk.  I lost motor coordination/control in hands and feet.  I was cold, never felt faint, and had slightly evaluated blood pressure for me( normal is 110/64 paramedics got it at 152/94).

                                                chest tightness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician reported for herself. A 67-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left deltoid on 17Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma well controlled.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced chest tightness on 17Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 17Jan2021.

She asked for her husband&#39;s albuterol inhaler and was back within baseline within minutes. Stated that she used her husband&#39;s albuterol inhaler once and recovered completely. Clarified the name as Albuterol HFA 90mcg Inhaler (90mcg; one box has 200 puffs).

In the afternoon I started with light headache and dry cough (intermittent), no temperature. I did not take anything for it and continued working. When I got home, I felt weak and was supposed to join my family for Christmas and decided not to go. And went to sleep. The next day (Sat) I was still not feeling well, weakness on my limbs, I went to the hospital to see if I could get checked and they told me to return on Monday because Occupational Health was closed on the weekends. I went home and treated myself with Tylenol and Vitamin C. On Monday I got tested and was positive. By then, I was coughing, limbs weak, had temperature (101F).  I started to get weaker an weaker and Tuesday or Wednesday my work called me and asked me if I would like to come see a doctor. Wednesday I started with shortness of breath. I called my PCP and he prescribed me an albuterol inhaler. It helped me but my cough got worse by Saturday. My doctor then told me to go to the hospital (I live by myself).  At my choice I went to Medical Center and were admitted and was hospitalized for 6 days.  They kept treating me with inhaler and oxygen. They wanted to send me to rehab but I told them I wanted to go home. I came home with oxygen and with albuterol inhaler and the ambulance had to bring me home. I still was feeling very weak, had cough, and had the shortness of breath. And I have been home since then. I have home health and a therapist that come check on me 2X a weekly.

Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of antilymphocyte immunoglobulins in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of antilymphocyte immunoglobulins has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT152B2 and antilymphocyte immunoglobulins to the events syncope, low BP and heart rate, adrenal crisis, cannot be excluded. The underlying Addison disease and Pituitary Tumor are major cofounders for the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Today, I still have some symptoms but not as often or severe.

Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol, ongoing high blood pressure, and eyeglasses wearer. Ongoing concomitant medications included nebivolol hydrochloride (BYSTOLIC Tablet) for high blood pressure, bumetanide tablet taken as diuretic, rosuvastatin calcium (ROSUVASTIN Tablet) for high cholesterol, and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN Tablet) to keep healthy. The patient reported that her blood pressure went up and is still up since last Tuesday (as reported). She received the first dose of the COVID vaccine at 11 am. She was okay until that evening around 5 pm, her blood pressure started going up, her blood pressure shot up. She called her doctor. Her doctor and her did not know if her blood pressure going up could be from the vaccine. Her doctor told her to take more of her already prescribed blood pressure medication. The next day, she went to see her doctor due to blood pressure still being high and he gave her more blood pressure medications. Her doctor prescribed a different kind of blood pressure medication to take along with her existing blood pressure medication (BYSTOLIC). She is concerned and asked if her elevated blood pressure will go back to normal, her blood pressure is still high. Her doctor told her when someone has a reaction to a vaccine, it usually takes days or up to two weeks to recover from the reaction. Her blood pressure is still high and her doctor is puzzled and prescribed her more medications to control her blood pressure. Today, 01Feb2021, at the doctors office her blood pressure was 156/81. Yesterday, 31Jan2021, her blood pressure was 180 over 80 something. She puts her glasses on to read the card. Patient would like to know how long will her symptoms last and if she is going to die from this. She is getting nervous and requests to be transferred to address her question. She thought she was the first person this has happened to but she read online that one person has had the same symptoms with high blood pressure after receiving the vaccine. She had been advising everyone to get the vaccine but now she will advise her family to hold off. The outcome of the event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9263) to reported event Blood pressure increased cannot totally be excluded.

A 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Feb2021 at 13:00 at 67-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the Pfizer suspect vaccine. Medical history included blood pressure increased (BP raised) in Sep2020 (BP reading was 135/80).  There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced: &#34;could have died with a blood pressure with these numbers&#34; (medically significant, life threatening) on an unspecified date, and blood pressure had spiked up to 235/104 (medically significant, life threatening) on 11Feb2021 at 16:30. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient reported that she was a healthy person; and she had never had blood pressure problems before (as reported). The patient also reported that she was &#34;on no medications whatsoever.&#34; Five months ago (from the time of the report), the patient had a wellness exam. The patient&#39;s &#34;blood pressure was perfect.&#34; It was reported that &#34;everything was perfect&#34; with her health exam five months ago. Five months prior, the patient&#39;s BP reading was 135/80. The patient thought that the COVID vaccine was very dangerous and she was unaware that hypertension could even be a side effect. The patient received the vaccine on 09Feb2021, and she &#34;got a long fine while waiting at the facility.&#34; Two days later, on 11Feb2021, the patient took her blood pressure and she could not believe the reading. The patient then went to a pharmacy and had the pharmacist take it for her because she thought &#34;she was crazy&#34;; and because she thought her machine was not right. The patient&#39;s blood pressure had spiked up to 235/104. When the pharmacist took her blood pressure, they told her she needed to go to the ER immediately. The patient was informed her blood pressure was beyond stroke level; therefore, she was rushed to the ER and was given IV BP medications to try and get her blood pressure down. The patient was released to home. The patient, after she went to the ER the first time, she was told to go see her primary care the following day. Two days later she was back in the ER with spiked blood pressure on 13Feb2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure on 13Feb2021 was 224/84. The patient was again treated and released.   The patient stated that she saw who she believed was a physician assistant (PA). The patient was started on a blood pressure medication as well; and her last and most recent blood pressure reading was 144/85. The patient reported that the she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide. After the patient&#39;s first ER visit, she was prescribed 12.5mg once a day. However, after the second ER visit, she had a blood pressure spike and the dose was increased to 25mg once a day.  The patient received the paper with side effects, and she had none of the side effects listed; &#34;none, whatsoever.&#34; The patient read that the more severe side effects were difficulty breathing, fast heartbeat, rash, dizziness. The patient further stated that &#34;under that, it was list serious and unexpected side effects may occur&#34;; this was where the patient felt like her situation come in. It was serious and unexpected. The patient reported that she was upset; and felt that she could have died with a blood pressure of those numbers. The patient reported that she was a healthy person and she was looking forward to getting the vaccine. The patient stated she would not be getting the second vaccine. The patient wished she just had the normal listed side effects such as arm soreness, joint pain, fever, headache; however, she did not experience any of those events. The patient felt that if she did not check her blood pressure at home on her own, she would not have known her blood pressure was that high. The patient then added she had spoken to a couple of doctors and they had a total of five cases that were very similar to hers and had to be treated. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: spike on an unspecified date, blood pressure: 135/80 in Sep2020, blood pressure: 235/104 on 11Feb2021, blood pressure: 224/84 on 13Feb2021, blood pressure: 144/85 in Feb2021, health exam: everything was perfect on an unspecified date.

                                                About ten minutes after the shot, my heart suddenly started pounding, I was panting, and I got very hot.  Then tingling went all over my body, even in my lips.  At one point, I felt close to fainting.  The pharmacist lady gave me cold water (I asked for it), and I just sat there for quite a while.  Gradually my heart rate came down, and I got cold, but the tingling kept going, and I felt somewhat weak.  Since I didn&#39;t want any epinephrine (it affects my heart), and I didn&#39;t think I was so bad that I needed an ambulance, after being there nearly an hour my husband drove me home.  There I took some liquid Benadryl, and that seemed to help with the tingling.  I just took it easy after that.  Considering my reaction tothe first dose, I will NOT be getting the second one.  I don&#39;t need to consult with a doctor to decide that.  It was somewhat frightening because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was going to get.

                                                Chills; pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body; difficulty in breathing/labored breathing; tightness in the chest/chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort; joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep; Feeling unwell; Muscle pain; Injection site pain; Headache; has not felt normal; Tiredness; allergic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 67-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: unknown) at 67-year-old vaccination age at a single dose in the left arm for covid-19 immunization and sucrose at unknown dosing regimen for an unspecified indication, both via an unspecified route of administration on 30Jan2021. Medical history included diabetes. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) and insulin for diabetes. The patient reported that she received her first dose on 30Jan2021 with no problem at all but this past week her blood sugar levels have been climbing. She normally was 120-150 [unknown unit] then all of a sudden, it&#39;s 200 [unknown unit] something or 300 [unknown unit] something and then the last couple days (2021), she was battling 500 [unknown unit] and something. She was just wondered because she looked at the ingredients in the shot and it has sucrose, so she just wondered if that is why her sugar levels are rising. The patient has tried getting hold of her doctor to ask the same question, but her office is closed since last three days, so they didn&#39;t have their phones connected. She reported that she did not have issues with the shot, its fine didn&#39;t get sick or anything. She&#39;s just worrying if that&#39;s the reason her blood sugar levels are rising. The outcome of the events unknown.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

On Monday, 22Feb2021, the patient felt draggy, but did not think it was a big deal. She just thought it was from the shot and was feeling tired. The draggy feeling lasted a few days, but she was unable to clarify outcome further. On Tuesday, she started to feel achy and felt like that too was to be expected. The achiness went away on 25Feb2021. On Wednesday, 24Feb2021, she was really busy. She was still achy but was busy. She also did not drink much water for several hours. It dawned on her later when she was not feeling good. Late Wednesday afternoon it was like everything cratered and she felt horrible. She was feeling bad. She was freezing and had chills.

A 67-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot no: EL1284) at vaccination age of 67-year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose to prevent COVID19 (covid-19 immunisation). Medical history included interstitial lung disease and overactive thyroid (She was treated for overactive thyroid, but it has been stable for five years). Concomitant medication included nitrofurantoin for interstitial lung disease and fluticasone. The patient previously took prednisone [prednisone acetate] (She did ten weeks of Prednisone and has been off Prednisone since the middle of Nov2020. She started at 30mg and tapered down to 20mg then to 10mg and then to 5mg until she was done). The patient experienced feeling lightheaded, mild headache, fatigue, erratic bp 01Feb2021 11:30, feeling nauseous on an unspecified date in 2021. Took Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine last week. Began feeling lightheaded, mild headache, fatigue, erratic BP on Monday, 4 days after receiving the vaccine. Went to Emergency department on Monday evening. Has been continuing off and on since Monday. Can these symptoms occur after 4 days patient questioned. Has already reported to DSU. She got Pfizer&#39;s COVID19 Vaccine a week ago today. She was doing fine and then Monday she started with mild headache, erratic blood pressure readings. She ended up in the ER because it was so high. It stabled out and she went home. She was feeling ok on Tuesday, but not quite normal. She was fine yesterday until last night then it started again with erratic blood pressure, fatigue, mild headache and lightheadedness. The headache is never pounding. The lightheadedness won&#39;t go away. Is that normal to have that many days after receiving the vaccine? It was four days before she started experiencing it. Now she feels kind of normal as long as she is laying down except for headache. As of 15Feb2021, the patient reported that she called a couple weeks ago and reported adverse side effects and she needed a couple questions answered. She mentioned that she was due to have the second vaccine this weeks (18Feb2021). She was extremely worried about doing it because even some of the effects she had after 4 days in the first vaccination have not subsided. She added that it landed her in emergency room a couple of times (also reported as ended up in the ER twice). She inquired if should she take the second one at this point or can she wait and if she can wait for how long. She mentioned that she had a spike in her blood pressure (BP), she had accelerated HR on an unspecified date in 2021, she was very lightheaded to the point she thought she was going to pass out on an unspecified date in 2021. The second time around, her body was trembling on an unspecified date in 2021, she had body shakes. It was not fun. All of these effects have returned to somewhat normalcy, but she is still experiencing lightheadedness. She has seen her own physicians, but she is not sure if she should proceed with the second vaccine. The outcome of the event lightheadedness was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was recovering.  Follow up (15Feb2021): New information received from a contactable consumer (patient) included: lab data, new event (accelerated HR, to the point she thought she was going to pass out, body shakes/trembling) and clinical course of the events.

Concomitant medication included benazepril (BENAZEPRIL) for blood pressure abnormal from an unspecified start date and ongoing; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) for arrhythmia from 2014 and ongoing; rifaximin (XIFAXAN) for hepatic encephalopathy from 2014 and ongoing; lactulose (LACTULOSE)for hepatic failure, ammonia abnormal from 2014 and ongoing; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for autoimmune thyroiditis from 1984 and ongoing; omeprazole (PRILOSEC [OMEPRAZOLE]) for reflux gastritis, chronic gastritis from an unspecified start date and ongoing; alprazolam (XANAX) for anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder from 2009 and ongoing; albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]) for asthma from an unspecified start date and ongoing; ranitidine (RANITIDINE) for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.The patient previously took flu vaccine vii, olysio for hepatitis c and experienced histamine level increased, lyrica and experienced weight increased. Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered the patient experienced generalized aching on 01Mar2021 at 13:55 with outcome of not recovered. After twenty minutes she developed a pretty severe headache on 01Mar2021 14:05 with outcome of recovering. After 30 minutes she stared to feel nausea on 01Mar2021 at 14:15 with outcome of recovered. She stated that when she stood up to leave felt like started to feel dizzy on 01Mar2021  with outcome of unknown, and felt like she was going to faint on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown, her vision blurred on 01Mar2021  with outcome of not recovered and she had trouble getting into the elevator. She also experienced a loss of appetite on 01Mar2021 with outcome of recovering. The patient continued to describe her experiences noting that &#34;things changed daily&#34; and mentioning that she experienced fibromyalgia flare up on 01Mar2021  with outcome of not recovered, no energy  been very tired on 01Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered , no energy  been very tired on 01Mar2021  with outcome of not recovered , couldn&#39;t get warm- very cold, her skin was very cold  on 02Mar2021 01:30 with outcome of not recovered, flu-like symptoms on 01Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, hands feel warm to touch, but she still feels cold  on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown, she cannot sit or stand without discomfort in her spine on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown, she cannot sit or stand without discomfort in her spine  on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown, sick in Mar2021 with outcome of unknown, her bones hurt in Mar2021 with outcome of unknown, her muscles hurt in Mar2021 with outcome of unknown, wheezing  on an unspecified date in Mar2021 with outcome of unknown. Lab tests and procedures included cardiac output: over 50 percent, echocardiogram: her heart was good and clear, electroencephalogram with unknown results, magnetic resonance imaging with unknown results, all on unknown dates. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pretty severe headache; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between generalized aching, severe headache, feel dizzy, going to faint, vision blurred, no energy  been very tired, very cold, her skin was very cold, wheezing and bnt162b2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association. The Company considers the reported event fibromyalgia flare up is unrelated to bnt162b2 vaccine but more likely due to underlying medical history of ongoing fibromyalgia.

                                                Fifty hours after injection I had a mild nosebleed; This is a spontaneous report received from a Pfizer sponsored program from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 10Mar2021 10:00 (at the age of 67-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included breast cancer, high blood pressure and drug allergy to some medications, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included lisinopril and tamoxifen. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The patient stated that fifty hours after injection (12Mar2021, 12 noon) she had a mild nosebleed. However, it was also reported that the mild nosebleed started on 12Mar2021 at 11:30 PM. At 11:30 (as reported), she was awakened with a gushing nosebleed. They couldn&#39;t get it stopped so they had to call the squad. The patient stayed in emergency room/department or urgent care for several hours to get it under control. The patient received some type of syringe medication reported as &#34;Afrin packaging&#34; as treatment for the event. The event of nosebleed was considered as non-serious by the reporter. The patient had no history of problems with nose bleeds. It just seems coincidental to receiving the vaccine. The patient wanted to make sure it was safe for her to get the second dose. The patient underwent COVID-19 test type post vaccination via nasal swab on 24Feb2021 which resulted to negative. The outcome of the event was recovered.  Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6200), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Mar2021 11:45, single dose as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lung transplant from May2011, immunodeficiency from May2011 and ongoing, strokes. The patient had dtap vaccine before Jan2021. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); prednisone acetate (PREDNISONE); tacrolimus monohydrate (TACROLIMUS). Patient reported that it has been about a week and a half of maybe more since her first COVID vaccine and she gets new symptoms almost everyday. Most of the symptoms aren&#39;t like put-you-down sick, horrible symptoms, they can be dealt with, but she has had a lot of them. She never got injection site pain and her arm never got sore. She had tiredness on the second day after her COVID vaccine, she slept for almost two days. She has a headache almost constantly. She is having muscle pain or some kind of pain, maybe joint pain that is in her hips. She doesn&#39;t have chills, a fever, injection site swelling or redness. She has had nausea and she has generally felt unwell all the time for a week and a half now. She is immunocompromised because she has had a lung transplant, that is the one thing that probably sets her apart is that she is immunosuppressed. She had the lung transplant almost 10 years ago now and she has been doing well. She is not on blood thinner medicine but she does take a baby aspirin everyday. Those are the only two things that she can think about. She doesn&#39;t know if all of that would make the symptoms from the COVID vaccine different for her. Most people she knows who have received the COVID vaccine have only had a couple days of tiredness and a sore arm. But she has a headache, been achy, and she just doesn&#39;t feel good. She also had a headache then and slept a lot, she was really tired. Later in the report caller clarified the first dose was actually 09Mar2021. She is not tired right now but she does still have a headache today, it is a pretty good headache. Her tiredness was Sunday and Monday of this week, confirmed to be 14Mar2021 and 15Mar2021. She says that she has recovered completely from the tiredness even though she feels like she could nap right now but she can&#39;t since she has a blood draw later. It is like she wakes up and every day she gets new symptoms. She had two symptoms that are not on the sheet of symptoms. The two she experienced are weird. On Saturday, a week and a day after her vaccine, her eyes were yellow when she woke up that morning. Confirmed date to be 13Mar2021. It was only that one day. She thinks that she has recovered completely. Also, her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes. Some of this is normal in the winter for her, but the yellow isn&#39;t normal for her. Normally, when she does get the blood vessels in her eyes they will heal in a day or so but the ones now have lasted much longer. They have been much slower to go away. It is not like there is a red spot, but it looks kind of red and kind of weird. The other symptom that is strange is that her platelet levels dropped. She was at 49 before her COVID vaccine and now her platelet level is down to 29. She does have normally very low levels for platelets but they are usually around 50. They have dropped substantially since her COVID vaccine. They dropped from 50 to 33 and then 5 days later her level went to 29. She is getting another platelet level drawn today, confirmed to be 16Mar2021. Her eyes being sore, red, and having broken blood vessels occurred probably a couple of days after she received the COVID vaccine. Specifically, her left eye felt like it had something in but she doesn&#39;t believe that it did. She used eye drops. Her eye just felt gritty. This is not like she had pink eye and she didn&#39;t wake up with this eye shut. It wasn&#39;t pink eye she knows what that is like. Her eyes had broken blood vessels and then they turned yellow then they turned red and have remained red. They are not sore today and she doesn&#39;t feel like she has gravel in her eye but the whites of her eyes don&#39;t really look clear. She says so far it has improved some but she will see since she wakes up every day and something new has happened, or something different or something has come back again. The good news is that she doesn&#39;t have all of these symptoms at the same time. She can&#39;t the remember the day pain in hips began but it is ongoing. She noticed this morning that the pain in her hip was not as bad when she had gotten out of bed. That pain has lessened there but the pain went to her head. Nausea and generally not feeling well: Probed for when this began and caller says that it has occurred for several days after she eats dinner, her stomach will be growling loud and that comes along with abdominal pain which doesn&#39;t really fit in with muscle or joint pain, she has no muscle there unfortunately she jokingly says. Sometimes this is all accompanied with diarrhea. It is not ongoing as of now, no date provided. She noticed that it comes and goes and sometimes she can eat and she is fine and sometimes she gets really sick feeling. It seems like if she doesn&#39;t eat then she doesn&#39;t get the symptoms but she knows that she needs to eat. Investigations: Her doctor has been having her do platelet blood tests about every 5 days since she took the COVID vaccine. She does not remember the dates of these tests off of the top of her head. She had a blood draw at the clinic the day before her COVID vaccine and her platelet count was 49 on 08Mar2021. For the result of 29 that was either last Thursday or last Friday, 11Mar2021 or 12Mar2021. Te outcome of the event scleral discoloration was recovered on 13Mar2021, tiredness was recovered on 15Mar2021, headache was not recovered, pain in hip was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021299104 similar report from same reporter

She states that she has been thinking if she should be wasting Pfizers time reporting this but it could be a coincidence or maybe a reaction.

A contactable other healthcare professional and a consumer (patient) reported that a 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; treprostinil sodium (TYVASO, concentration of 0.6 mg/ml), resp inhalation (reported as via inhalation (IH) route) from 23Sep2020 (batch/lot number: 2101929; expiration date: 31Jan2022) to an unspecified date, delivered by Tyvaso inhalation device (TD-300/A) at 18-54 ug, QID (3-9 breaths), then via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (batch/lot number was not reported) to an unspecified date, at 72 ug to 60 ug (12 to 10 breaths) for secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. Medical history included ongoing secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Concomitant medication included tadalafil taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced events of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hospitalized), hypertension (hypertension, hospitalized) and reaction to COVID vaccine (vaccination complication, hospitalized). On an unreported date, the patient experienced events of really sick (illness), nausea (nausea) and headache (headache). On an unreported date, the patient had decreased breaths from 12 to 10 breaths (off label use). It was also reported that the patient had decreased breaths from 72 ug to 60 ug (12 to 10 breaths). The patient was really sick, nausea and headache. On 25Mar2021, 6 months and 3 days after initiating IH Tyvaso, the patient was hospitalized for reaction to coronavirus disease (COVID) vaccine, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, and hypertension. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 28Mar2021. The action taken in response to the events chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and vaccination complication for treprostinil sodium was not reported, and dose was decreased due to the events illness, nausea and headache. At the time of reporting, the outcome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, vaccination complication, illness, nausea and headache was unknown. The reporter did not provide causality for the events of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and vaccination complication. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events illness, nausea and headache with IH treprostinil sodium was considered to be possibly related.   Case Comment/Sender&#39;s Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse event of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and vaccination complication as not related to IH treprostinil and TD-300/A device. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension were likely due to exacerbation of underlying COPD and Hypertension respectively. Vaccination complication was due to COVID vaccine.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is based on the company causality assessment.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the event chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, vaccination complication, illness, headache, nausea and the suspect drug BNT162B2 , TYVASO cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7534),dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 67years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Beta thalassemias. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient stated she has never had a problem with vaccinations, and she gets the flu vaccine every year. The patient reported that after the first injection coincidentally she did develop a blood clot in her lower leg. She thinks that it was due to a plane ride, but she has never had a blood clot before the injection. She added that she had the first dose on 16Mar2021 and developed a clot in a week. She further clarified that she got her first injection on 16Mar2021 and realized when she went on a flight, which is not that far she developed that clot and was having problems shortly after flight home on 24Mar2021 where her leg swelled up and she is on blood thinners since she went to the emergency room. She added that she developed the clot sometime between that flight and 02Apr2021. She had a doppler study on an unspecified date and it showed a blood clot.  She stated that the outcome was she does not have the blood clot (as reported) but she will be on blood thinners and she needs to follow up on her scan to see if the clot issue is resolved but she will not have a doppler scan for another month or two and the blood thinner she is taking is Xarelto. She also stated that her right leg swelled up and it felt like a log. She reported it felt achy and swollen quite a bit from knee down and her leg was achy. It started between 24Mar2021 and by time she went to the emergency room she was not getting better. She had her symptoms for a week and toward the end of the week she thought she had a blood clot since it was not getting better it just got worse. She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better. The outcome of events was recovering. (As reported &#34;outcome is unknown but pretty sure it has improved because of the blood thinners&#34;./She stated she does not think it has resolved because it takes time for clots to resolve./She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better.)  The reporter stated for the seriousness criteria for event blood clot: she believes as a nurse that any blood clot is extremely dangerous, and she was not hospitalized but obviously a blood clot is serious, and she could have ended up with pulmonary embolism. The seriousness for events right leg swelled and achy was reported as medically disabling.  Causality assessment: Patient stated for the blood clot she has doubts if it was related to the vaccine but is it something that should be known about; for the leg swelling and achy she has doubts but it could have been the plane ride.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the reported events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is unlikely related to the suspected drug. The plane ride may provide an explanation for the events.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A 67 years old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199) on 10Mar2021 17:30 at age of 67 years old at single dose in right upper arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included: last year February, she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, she has had acid reflux in the past. digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable). There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events (AE) following prior vaccinations. Patient had first Pfizer covid vaccine on 10MAR2021, approximately 10 days to 14 days after the vaccine her face swelled up, numbness and red on left side, went to see my  doctor, he treated her with steroid and antibiotic for sinus infection, at the same time she had some shortness of breath and pounding in my chest, and had and still have ringing in ears since then, it kind of flared up some digestive issues she had last year. If she back up to last year February, she had a bad sinus infection, went to see allergist, family doctor and ENT, all treated her for sinus&#39; before covid testing was even a thing, they didn&#39;t think of covid testing at the time. It ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity.  In March2020 her husband came home with covid, after that, talking to his doctor, she brought him meals outside of the door, it occurred to her that queried if this could have been covid. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable), they were still not sure if it could have been covid. She was supposed to get the second vaccine, she postponed it, the numbness and swelling of face is gone, next shot was tomorrow. Since this was a delayed reaction, typically one to three days would be a reaction to the vaccine. she didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine, asked if it could have been from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure that she was safe to get the second one. Response: Spoke from EUA factsheet for Recipients and Caregivers: LAB-1451-4.0 Revised: 06 April 2021: Sections: who should not get the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and what the risks of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE were. Spoke from attached VR Consumer- Pfizer cannot assess causality (i.e., cannot assess if what you described/are experiencing is associated with the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine). Your doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise you as your doctor/healthcare provider is most familiar with your medical condition, clinical history, how your treatment has been conducted and any relevant information to your specific case. Patient calling about the COVID vaccine. She states that she had the first vaccine 10MAR2021, and 10 days afterwards her face swelled up. She had numbness in it and redness. She went to the doctor and the doctor thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. So she was treated for that. She states that she did have a few other symptoms. To make a long story short, she was suppose to have the last vaccine last Friday. She postponed it for a week (postponed getting the second shot for a week). She wants to know what Pfizer thinks about her getting her second vaccine and her side effects. She says that somewhere between the 10th and 14th day, after receiving the vaccine the symptoms started and that was why she did not think she had a reaction to the vaccine. She has not had anything like that before, it was sort of a delayed reaction. She states she is better now. She had a few symptoms after the face things started and the only thing that she still has now is ringing in her ears. She states it all started around the same time as her face issues, or might have started a little after that. She confirms everything but ringing in her ears have completely resolved. She states that she did have some digestive disturbances, shortness of breath, and throbbing in her chest after receiving the vaccine. She asks if she can go back a little bit to explain. She states that last FEB2020 she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. She went to her allergist, then her family doctor, and then an ENT. She states that it was nothing like she has ever had, it was really bad. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, she has had acid reflux in the past but it was nothing like this. In March her husband had COVID and tested positive for COVID. She decided to get tested and she tested negative. She wonders if she had COVID earlier but at that time they were not testing for COVID. Her digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, and she was still on the medications her gastrointestinal doctor put her on. They are hypersensitive esophageal medication. She states that she has been exhausted all the time. The rest of the story she has told already. She states that after the face thing happened she started getting those digestive issues again. Her friend suggested that she call Pfizer, so she is doing that. She confirms that the vaccine card does not have an expiration date, NDC, or dosing information. She states it says 0.3 ml, but she cant see a point, so she doesn&#39;t know if its just 03. She states she got the vaccine to lessen her chances of getting a severe disease, in case she ends up in the hospital. Also, to keep herself safe from other people. She states she wants the second one because husbands works with the public and she wants to be protected when he comes home. She states that she has those gastrointestinal disturbances and is on amitriptyline 10 mgs for that. She states she also takes something for her thyroid but she has no major health issues. She states that she had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy as well as blood work done but she doesn&#39;t have any of the results because they are in her Beaumont chart where she actually got the vaccine. All of this was pre-vaccine so she doesn&#39;t know how relevant it is. The patient did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but visit to Physician Office. The only thing similar had a sister who reacted to a shingles vaccine, She has no information about her sisters reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of event ringing in ears was not recovered, for others was recovered.      No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

The outcome of the events was recovered on 16Mar2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events nausea and vaccination site pain were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile.

A 67-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6208) intramuscular, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 67-year-old, on 19Mar2021 11:00, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma and Allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number EN6203) single dose, at the age of 67-year-old, on 26Feb2021, for covid-19 immunisation and experienced slight ache in her left arm, headaches, and mitral valve disease.  On 20Mar2021, the patient had headaches off and on and the patient mostly woke up with them. The patient doesn&#39;t know if the headaches were from pollen in the air since it is Spring time or mold. On 24Mar2021 at 4am, the patient got out of bed because she had to use the restroom. As soon as the patient took the first step into the tile floor of the bathroom, the patient collapsed. The patient didn&#39;t fall, the patient collapsed on the file floor. Her head hit the floor. Her head was killing her when she was laying there. The patient used the restroom and went back to bed. The patient got out of bed because her head was killing her. The patient guesses she threw her right arm out to brace herself, because she noticed her right arm was bruised the morning of 24Mar2021 when she went to shower. The patient took Equate 500MG for the events head hit the tile floor of bathroom, headache, and right arm was bruised and used a wash cloth with cold water as a cold compress and applied it by her eyebrow, the corner of her eye was purple/bruised. It looked like she had eyeshadow on. On 24Mar2021, she was feeling nauseated. Thankfully, she had the next 2 days off  (Thursday and Friday) because she didn&#39;t feel so hot. On 26Mar2021, the patient called her PCP and was asked if she wanted to come in/ make an appointment. Since, the caller was planning to meet with the surgeon about her upcoming surgery on 29Mar2021, it didn&#39;t really fit into her schedule. She was undergoing all these tests, etc. It was determined her surgery was going to happen after receiving the second vaccine. The surgery is hopefully a mitral valve repair. The patient mentioned that her provider is aware of her experience with the COVID vaccine. The patient saw the surgeon on 29Mar2021, and she told him all about her experience. He advised the patient to call her PCP and schedule an appointment with them. She saw her PCP on 01Apr2021. She told her PCP what happened and her PCP asked why she didn&#39;t go to urgent care. The patient doesn&#39;t really know why she didn&#39;t, she just thought she was going to feel better. The patient thought she would work through the pain since Mar2021. Plus, she had everything going on with her surgery- like finding out she had to have the surgery and going under other tests. Her PCP wanted her to go to radiology to have a MRI of the head/brain done. She had the MRI done at 3:00PM on 06Apr2021 and the results were negative. Up until last weekend, she still felt &#34;headachy&#34;. The patient has headaches too because of stress knowing her surgery was scheduled in a matter of 2 weeks, so she didn&#39;t know if the headaches she was experiencing was because of the COVID vaccine, stress, allergies, etc. The patient was certain the headache she experienced the day after she collapsed, was due to the collapse. The patient clarified that she knew it was more of a &#34;collapse&#34; instead of a fall because all the furniture leading to the bathroom, like the loveseat, lamp, cedar chest, etc, were all intact with no marks. It was like all of a sudden she collapsed. Her bruising is all gone, but there might be a slight mark that is like yellow and green (because the bruising changes colors) on her arm. Her eye was okay. The patient will have her planned surgery on 15Apr2021. The events required physician office visit. The patient underwent unspecified lab test and procedures relevant to her upcoming surgery but no other testing in regards to her symptoms after the COVID vaccine. Outcome of headache was not recovered, the events corner of her eye was purple/bruised and right arm was bruised recovered in 2021, while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

A 68-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot /batch and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she got the vaccine yesterday (07Jan2021) and that a couple of hours later she began to experience neck stiffness, coughing with production of white mucous and felt like she couldn&#39;t breath with tightness for about a half hour. The patient was asking if this was normal. Outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I say I was fine until 3-4 hours later, I had extreme headaches. At 430pm, I still had the headaches and I took Tylenol 500mg. At night my headache got worse and it felt like I had the flu. I then went to bed and when I woke up my left arm felt intense like hornets and it was swollen. I then took another Tylenol and Ibuprofen 600mg. At 4am, I felt awful and horrible. I had joint pain with aches, felt nauseated. I called my PCP and he told me to take Prednisone 10mg. My fever was 101.4F. By the night my fever was gradually coming down and it was 102F. By the next day I felt much better.  I also had Covid-19 on March 2020 and also got tested for antibody test in July 2020.  I spoke with my PCP and he is recommending I do not take the 2nd dose injection.

The biggest problem was that my eyes became strangely affected, like there were shutters being opened and closed in rhythmic waves inside my eyes. They were also very photosensitive and blurry. My whole head felt wrong. drove me home, (I could not have driven).  This lasted several hours. I had chills and stayed laying down with my eyes closed. By the end of the day I felt mostly recovered.  This series of events recurred 6 days later,  on Jan. 20th. This time it also lasted most of the day, but I continued feeling moderately unwell the next day, and today it continues. I feel weak and unsteady. My eyes are better but  not entirely. They ache and feel insecure. I am not currently feeling up to any activities besides resting.

                                                Hot, red flush on face (particularly cheeks and forehead), slightly puffy, mild tingling in lips I was observed for an extra 20-30 minutes.  Vital signs were taken.  Blood pressure up slightly, heart rate slightly elevated Sent home without treatment but recommended I should take antihistamine at home. I took a 12-hour allegra about 12pm and a single 25 mg benadryl tablet at bedtime. The symptoms lasted about 3-4 hours before resolving.  They did not get worse from the immediate reaction. Recommended contacting my family physician for advice of what to do before 2nd shot which is scheduled for Feb. 15, 2021

                                                Patient presented to the ED on 1/21/21 for evaluation of SOB stating her husband tested positive for COVID earlier that week and she has been around him. The patient states her symptoms started 3-4 days prior to presentation. She admits to cough, nausea, and an episode of vomiting the day of presentation. She had been intermittently using her husband&#39;s oxygen prior to presentation which she says has helped with her symptoms, but does not use oxygen at baseline. Upon presentation the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation rate on room air is 89%. Patient was placed on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula and then was saturating in the mid 90s. CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates in the ED which the ED physician felt to be consistent with COVID infection. The patient&#39;s rapid COVID test resulted as positive. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management of hypoxia related to COVID infection. The patient remains hospitalized on the day of report submission (1/28/21)

After 3-4 days, my hairline started receding slightly on the sides of my scalp in the front.  This continued each day and I had to increase my blood pressure medicine and double the dose because it was getting so high.  I was anxious and upset and am afraid to take the second dose because I feel that I will get a worse reaction, and am frightened.

Reaction description by the reporter:&#34; I had no pain, slight headache. My blood pressure now is 137/93. It was high this morning when I talked with the triage nurse. I had the shot/vaccine (first dose) on Friday. I feel better today than yesterday. Friday I felt fine. I got symptoms yesterday. When I woke up yesterday. I was feeling a little woozy, I always stretch slowly in bed. I slowly raised myself on the bed but before I got up my torso fell backwards. I felt like I was fainting. The room was spinning. All day yesterday I did not drive. I walked very slowly. I was holding onto the wall. I felt lousy like I had the flu. I would lay down for 20 minutes, watching tv. My head was sideways and every time I would raise my head the room was spinning. Also there is not enough spit in my mouth. It is very dry. I had a slight headache. So I did not bother but no headache today. I supposed to get my 2nd dose on 02Feb2021. The action taken was not applicable. Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

This 68-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unknown route, on 14Jan2021 (at 08:30) at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included orthostatic intolerance, myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant concomitant medications included hydrocortisone (CORTEF), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), fludrocortisone acetate (FLUDROCORTISON) and pyridostigmine. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. On 14Jan2021, after vaccination, she began to feel unsteady, weak, lightheaded, chest tight, and dizzy. Her eyed began swimming with a sensation of shutters being opened and closed in front of her. She could not see very well, eyes were very photosensitive. Layed down and slept, rested in a dark room most of the day. She had also chills and headache. But nightfall she felt mostly recovered, although not very energetic. About one week later, on 20Jan2021, it all happened again, all at once. She also rested for the day and slowly recovered. But this time it hasn&#39;t all gone away. She is still weak, fuzzy, unsteady, fatigued, she had headache, and &#39;my eyes are not right&#39; (as reported). Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination COVID tests were not performed. No treatments were given for the events. The outcome of the events &#39;unsteady&#39;, &#39;weak/not very energic/fatigued&#39;, &#39;Lightheaded/Dizzy&#39;, and &#39;chest tight&#39; was not recovered while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

I also noticed small, red blotches.   *By Sunday, February 21, 2021, there were more blotches that had spread across to my back and across my chest on the left side. There was severe burning, zinging pain that traveled across my chest, under my left arm, and across to my back. * Monday, February 22, 2021, I visited the Doctor who confirmed it was shingles.  She prescribed 1 gram of Valacyclovir (Valtrex) 3x daily for 7 days. *The shingles have now covered my entire left breast,  under my entire left arm area with a huge patch on my back. It has become extremely uncomfortable with much burning, stinging, and zinging that travels along the rash area and down my left arm.

                                                Pt received her first Pfizer COVID vaccine today at approximately 1305.  She stated approximately 10 minutes into observation she developed abdominal pain and felt like she needed to have a BM.  She sat on the toilet and had an episode of diarrhea and started to feel flushed, diaphoretic and stood up to go to the sink.  She then felt nausea, dizziness and lightheaded and placed her head down leaning over the sink.  EMT arrived to bathroom and sat patient down in a wheelchair.  I arrived on scene shortly thereafter and the patient was pale and diaphoretic stating she did not feel well.  EMS was activated. She was placed on the cardiac monitor and her HR was NSR in the 80&#39;s.  BP 114/61, 96% on RA.   Denied CP, SOB, rash, mouth, lip or tongue swelling. She was brought back to the observation area and was assisted to the gurney.  Cool compresses were placed on her forehead and behind her neck.  Medics arrived to scene to assess the patient.  She stated she was feeling improved and did not want to go to the ED.  She signed the AMA form. She was given water and crackers. She was monitored for 1 hour and stated she felt improved.  She denied dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea or abdominal pain.  I assisted her to the bathroom and she had one more episode of diarrhea.  She stated she felt improved after that. She was monitored for 15 more minutes and stated she would like to go home.  She was able to get up off the gurney without assistance, stated she felt well.  She was ambulatory with a  Steady gait and assisted outside.  Prior to discharge I recommended she follow up with her PCP.  Advised that she rest for the remainder of the day and to activate 911 should she develop any new or worsening symptoms.  Advised that if she does get the second dose of vaccine she should be laying down at the time of administration and for 30 minutes after the injection for observation.

                                                multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli; pulmonary hypertension; short of breath; right heart strain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 68-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE, lot number=EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration at right arm on 22Dec2020 08:00 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included uveitis, arthritis and known allergies: pine nuts. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone (eye gtt), naproxen as needed (PRN) less than weekly.  The patient previously took theophylline and experienced allergies. The day after getting the first dose of vaccine the patient worked all day in another (clinic withheld). She felt well all day, but at 6 pm when she left to go to her car she was so short of breath she had to stop twice to get there. Subsequent work up has shown that she had multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. Adverse event start date was 23Dec2020. Adverse event start time was 06:00 PM. The adverse events resulted in: [Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization for 1 day, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event)]. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Lovenox and Eliquis. The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile the reported events are unlikely related to bnt162b2 .  These are probably intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 24Jan2021 09:22 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included degenerative disc disease (first disc came out) from 2007, chronic fibromyalgia from 2005, rheumatoid arthritis from 2000 (went into remission for a few years; while in remission, she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia), vertigo (diagnosed when she was 24 years old; bout of vertigo about twice a year; last year, 2020, was the worst bout of vertigo she ever had), allergy to shellfish (hives, itching, welts), sulfa (anaphylactic reaction), and mostly pain related issues. There were no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the COVID vaccine knowing that she had a reaction to the first dose. She had a reaction which she believed was from the vaccine she received. She felt something immediately but did not concern herself with it, was kept for 30 minutes for observation. Her heart rate went up (from 89 to 99) and then her heart rate came back down. She said after the 30 minutes had gone by, she felt better. On 25Jan2021 and 26Jan2021, she felt extreme pressure when she breathed, like an elephant sitting on her chest which lasted all day. Patient woke up the next morning and pains were still there. It was also reported that the patient had extreme chest pain on 25Jan2021. She said that the chest pain was not like a heart attack, but she felt a lot of pressure and weight when she was breathing in. By the time she went to bed in the night of 25Jan2021 night, she felt fine. When she got up the next day, Tuesday, 26Jan2021, and started moving around, the chest pain came back. When she woke up on Wednesday, 27Jan2021, everything was all gone. Patient is scheduled for her second COVID-19 vaccine shot on 14Feb2021.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right deltoid on 06Mar2021 10:09 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis; famotidine (PEPCID) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis; methylprednisolone acetate (MEDROL) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis. The patient previously received H1N1 vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, lot number: UP006AA, expiry date: 15Mar2011) on 27Oct2009 and experienced anaphylaxis. Patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the suspect product. The patient experienced blood pressure was checked and it had skyrocketed to 204/110 (hospitalization (from 06Mar2021 to 08Mar2021)) on 06Mar2021, felt chest pressure on 06Mar2021 10:29, facial flushing and warmth on 06Mar2021 10:29, redness on her neck and chest on 06Mar2021 10:29, she was lightheaded on 08Mar2021, blood pressure had dropped to 95/58 on 08Mar2021 21:43. Clinical course: Caller states that she received her first dose of the product on 06Mar at 10:09am. Caller states that to provide some history, in Oct2009, she had anaphylaxis from the H1N1 Vaccine and in 2017, she finally found an allergist who specialized in medication allergies. Caller states that since then, any time she takes the Flu Vaccine, she pre medicates with a combination of antihistamines and a proton pump inhibitor. Caller states that in preparation of the COVID vaccine, her allergist prescribed her a Medro Dose pack and antihistamines and a proton pump inhibitor for preparation, starting three days prior to the vaccine, in order to prevent anaphylaxis. Caller states that 20 minutes post receiving the vaccine, she started to feel chest pressure, she had facial flushing and warmth, and redness on her neck and chest. Caller states that her blood pressure was checked and it had skyrocketed to 204/110. Caller states that she did not have anaphylaxis though. Caller reports that with her blood pressure being so high, they had to call paramedics, and the caller went via ambulance to the ER at about 1130am on 06Mar2021. Caller states that she spent 6 hours in the ER, and then she was put in the hospital for the next two days. Caller reports she was admitted to the hospital for her blood pressure because the ER could not get it below 185 systolic. Caller states that all her labs were negative for everything, and they checked heart attack markers that were all negative. Caller had an EKG and a stress test and those were both negative as well. Caller had blood work done, EKG and stress test that were all normal. But caller states that it took a while to get her blood pressure down. Caller states that she was talking with her allergist and he said that if she gets the second dose of the vaccine, it would need to be in a hospital setting, with an IV already in place, and caller does not think insurance will cover all that. Caller states that she did speak with an Infectious Disease doctor, who told the caller that she needs to get the second dose of the product for COVID coverage, but how would the caller move forward with getting the second dose, following what happened to her? Caller is wondering how much protection the vaccine provides after just one dose? Caller is also wondering, the hospital gave her at least two or three doses of Solu-Medrol, and caller is wondering if having received steroids in the hospital would reduce the efficacy of the COVID vaccine, and if so, by how much? Event Details: Caller had the vaccine, and the reaction started on 06Mar2021, and she was admitted on the same day. Caller was discharged from the hospital on 08Mar2021 around 330pm. Caller reports that the morning of her discharge from the hospital, her blood pressure had gotten back to 135 systolic, but before it was time for her to go down for the stress test, it was back to 159, and down while she was in nuclear medicine, it got to 160 systolic. Caller reports that the day she was discharged, she went home and got settled in, and she took her blood pressure and it was down to 128/78, but then that evening, things got spinning around her, and lights were flickering in her head, and she was lightheaded, and her blood pressure was 110/63 at 9pm and by 9:43pm, her blood pressure had dropped to 95/58. Caller states that it has not been a fun trip. Caller reports that the next morning, her blood pressure was back up to 139/78, but then later in the day she was lightheaded again, and by 9am her blood pressure was 111/69. Caller states that since then, her systolic blood pressure has been between 110 and 126. Caller states that there is nothing else she can think of. Caller states that she felt fine the morning of getting the COVID vaccine, she was looking forward to getting it, and she got herself on the list and made sure to consult with her allergist so that she would have prophylactic medications ready to go. Caller states that she does have a history of hypertension, but her blood pressure was 128/72 the morning of getting the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events Blood pressure high and Blood pressure dropped was recovering, of the other events was unknown. The reporter considered the event blood pressure had skyrocketed to 204/110 was related to the suspect vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and known drug safety profile, a possible contributory role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the reported event blood pressure increased cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old female contactable consumer reporting for herself received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6200, expiry date Jun2021) on 16Feb2021 at 14:45, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine for age and several comorbidities. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed 25 years ago, ongoing hypothyroidism diagnosed 25 years ago, liver resection in 2007 for a benign tumor (she had not been sick and it was found accidentally), liver bile duct stopped up from 2017 and ongoing (due to scar tissue from the liver resection surgery; she had an emergency stent placed in her bile duct), chronic Crohn&#39;s disease, ongoing thyroid disorder. The patient previously received flu vaccines on unspecified dates for immunization experiencing unspecified side effects some years ago, but this past year she didn&#39;t have a reaction. The patient previously received pneumonia shots on unspecified dates since few years. Family history included gallbladder problems in her sisters and mother. Concomitant medications included oral amlodipine (manufacturer: Lupin, expiry date: 23Feb2022) from an unspecified date (a few years ago) and ongoing, 5 mg at night, for blood pressure, oral telmisartan (MICARDIS; manufacturer: Alembic, expiry date: 02Mar2022) from an unspecified date (few years ago) and ongoing, 80 mg at night, for blood pressure, oral metoprolol (manufacturer: Mylan, expiry date: 09Feb2022), from an unspecified date (few years ago) and ongoing, 25 mg twice daily, morning and night, for blood pressure, oral levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date (20 years ago or more), 75 ug daily in morning, with water, hour before any eating or other medications, for thyroid disorder. The patient experienced sepsis on 25Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 03Mar2021, gallbladder attack on 24Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, passed out from the gallbladder attack on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, got dizzy on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, weakness from being hospitalized on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, she was trying to gain her strength from being sick on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, her head hurt from the fall on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. The patient was hospitalized for sepsis due to a gallbladder attack from 25Feb2021 to 03Mar2021. The events gallbladder attack and sepsis required also an ER visit. They did not require a physician office visit. Additional clinical course of the events included the following details. Gallbladder attack turned into infection/sepsis quickly. She previously had an emergency stent placed in her bile duct and now there was a stone in the bile duct and she was unsure if it was related; they will either remove her gallbladder or place a permanent stent. They removed stones and &#34;goop&#34; and placed a stent. Her gallbladder still needed to be operated on, but she was not sick with sepsis anymore. Regarding gallbladder attack the patient reported that it was controlled until further tests and surgery were performed. They couldn&#39;t do the surgery due to the infection which had cleared up but she did not want the surgery right now. A stent was placed in the duct until something was done and the stone will be crushed eventually. The patient passed out from the gallbladder attack. She never passed out, she had only ever passed out one other time in her 20&#39;s where she stood up too fast. The patient reported that she had to walk slower because she got dizzy and she was trying to adjust to getting home. She walked to the bathroom, used it, and her husband heard a thump while he was using the other bathroom. She was looking at the thermostat and fell in the den and she was surprised she didn&#39;t hit anything. Her head hurt from the fall. Sepsis: caller reported that as soon as she went to the ER, she was diagnosed with sepsis. Sepsis resolved the day she was discharged from hospital and when she was dismissed all tests were negative for sepsis. She went home on antibiotics for security for another week after discharge from hospital. Dizzy: it was just trying to get her strength up. She&#39;ll just be doing nothing and getting up too fast, it happened to any old person with blood pressure medicines. Dizziness began before she went into the hospital. She was experiencing weakness from being hospitalized and she was trying to gain her strength from being sick. Weakness began during her hospital admission and it was ongoing. On 03Mar2021 the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included haematocrit: 30.4 %, haemoglobin: 10.4 g/dl (not in normal range yet), CMP: within normal limits (all results were within normal limits, including sodium and potassium), platelet count: 159, RBC count: 3.33 (supposed to be 3.9 or more but could have gotten better by now), WBC: 6.1 x10?/L, blood cultures: the results were not yet listed but sepsis was gone according to discharge blood work. She went to the doctor regularly. Her doctor knew how sensitive that was with her, but that her side effects were probably no more than anyone that experienced that. In some years she did not experience adverse events, specifically she did not with her flu vaccine in 2020. She has had side effects that had made her feel ill for 2-3 days and her niece was a nurse and thought she was making it up. The patient was advised to wait for the 2nd dose, she was unable to get it as scheduled on 08Mar2021. In meantime between receiving her first dose and her appointment for her second dose on 08Mar2021, she was hospitalized. The patient was just coming out of the hospital before 08Mar2021 and she still did not feel well so she cancelled the appointment. The hospital doctors, as well as the doctors approaching more tests with her gallbladder, recommended to not get the second dose as scheduled on 08Mar2021, but they could not recommend how or when to get it.

Yesterday it was back to normal and her heartrate was back in the 70s all day and she felt fine. Caller states that she had tried deep breathing and relaxation techniques and nothing worked to bring her heart rate down. Normally, if she gets stressed she deep breathes. She contacted her primary care provider by email and they sent the chart to allergist to help and said if her heart rate went above 110 to go to the emergency room. The caller asked if she should receive her second dose. Caller states that she was scared during the event, so she did contact (Health care company name), and they told the caller that she should have gone to the hospital. Caller states that (Health care company name) told the caller that the caller may not get the tachycardia from the second dose, but that the caller needs to let the nurses know about her side effect to the first dose.

Suspect Product and Indication details was provided as, caller reports that she got the product for COVID Prevention and because she has respiratory issues, but no further details were provided by the caller. Caller confirms that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Concomitant Medications, History and Investigations was reported as, caller states no to these questions. Caller states that in fact, she just had millions of lab tests and everything was fine and being that she was relaxing in a meditation when it started, caller is sure it was from the vaccine.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Mar2021 at 15:00 (Lot Number: EN6198) as single dose for covid-19 immunization.

Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for low thyroid/hypothyroidism from an unspecified start date (started probably been 10 years) and ongoing; atorvastatin taken for reduce cholesterol from 2020 (started right after she had stroke, either Jan2020 or Feb2020) and ongoing. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 01Mar2021 (at age of 68 years old, Lot Number: EN6200) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. She was fine right after the first dose. She only had a sore arm for 3 days. Just last week, she had a severe adverse reaction right after her vaccine. With the second dose, she had everything possible. Twelve hours after, on 23Mar2021 at 03:00, she awoke to throw up.  She thinks she fainted.  She had to throw up 2 more times that night. She had been wearing a heart monitor. On 24Mar2021 her cardiologist called her and told her she had a 19 second pause of no heartbeat and was in a 3rd degree heart block. The very next morning, they put in a pacemaker. She was overall healthy and athletic. She was a runner and golfs all the time. She had an outpatient procedure for the pacemaker placement at the hospital on 25Mar2021. She was still recovering but improving. Caller added it was scary when your heart stops.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: CER230) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The medical history included flu and suspected COVID-19 both in Jan2020 to an unspecified date (she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID because it was such a bad flu, over a year ago), ongoing asthma from an unspecified date (mild asthma) and chest nausea in Jan2020 to an unspecified date. The patient had no history of any adverse events following prior vaccinations. Medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was also reported as none. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event included an uncle that had asthma, but no one else had breathing issues. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulfate (DUONEB), both ongoing and taken for asthma on unspecified dates. Other products were also reported as &#34;no&#34;. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine and did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: 3N6202) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. On 24Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and headache; on 25Mar2021 the patient experienced flu-like symptoms, fever, achy, fatigue; on 02Apr2021 the patient experienced asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest, nausea feeling in her chest; on unspecified dates in Apr2021 the patient experienced she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia. The reporter classified the events headache and flu-like symptoms as non-serious. The patient called to report that she had an asthma flare up 10 days (as reported) after her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 24Mar2021. The patient stated that she did not get a flare up often, she had mild asthma. She usually got mild flare-ups since she did not have severe asthma. She stated it could be something else, but she had not had a flare-up like this since she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID-19 because it was such a bad flu. That was over a year ago. She received her second vaccine on 24Mar2021, and the asthma flare up and hacking cough started on 02Apr2021. On the night of 24Mar2021, she started with a headache. She had the shot at 11 something and by that evening before she went to bed, she had a headache and a sore arm, but that was no big deal. Then on 25Mar2021, she started with flu like symptoms/fever. The headache persisted through that as well. At that point, she did not have tightness or the dry, hacky cough. By the middle of the day on 27Mar2021, her flu-like symptoms were gone. She would consider these to be &#34;non-serious&#34;, it was what she expected, as it was seen from the paperwork of the vaccine. By 28Mar2021, all of her symptoms were gone prior to the flare-up. She had typical flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, achy, fatigue on the 2nd, 3rd, and into the 4th day but then they cleared up. By the evening of the 4th day, she started feeling fairly normal. She stated that they were mild flu symptoms. Her temperature was only 100 for about a day. She stated that that was expected. Then, she went into this flare-up about the 10th day after the vaccine. The first 3 or 4 days after the flare up began, the flare up was worsening. Then, she got it under a little bit of control, so she was not coughing all night and having to sit up as she was sleeping. Now, she was concerned about the pain and tightness in her chest and the hacky cough. She wanted to make sure it was not going into like a viral pneumonia or another thing. She did not know. She kept increasing her Advair use and was at the top of that. She was doing the duoneb which she did not usually have to do. She had not had to do that since Jan2020 when she had the 5-week flu, or it could have been COVID (they were calling it a hoax back then). She was using her duoneb 4 times a day and now she was using it to 2-3 times, but she was still getting chest tightness, hacky cough. It was kind of like nausea- it was hard to explain, it was kind of like a chest nausea, which she had also had back in Jan2020 when she had the bad flu. She also would get this laryngitis and had trouble talking. With her flare-up, her chest tightness/nausea feeling in the chest continued. Now, she was getting into laryngitis type of thing, but she could loosen that up with her duoneb but if she got to the point where she could not do that, she would definitely have to see someone right away. She clarified that when her chest got tight, the dry, hacky cough continued/increased. When she did the breathing treatment, it loosened it up for about 3-4 hours and some of the pain would go away in her chest. If she talked too much, she would begin to cough. She had had this flare up 3 times in her life, it was not very common. She was diagnosed with asthma in her 40s, and this was her 3rd time ever having anything like this. This was the first time she had experienced a flare up like this. She had had 3 episodes since she had had asthma in her 40&#39;s and all 3 bad episodes were about the same. All the episodes were related to illness, it did not just happen out of the blue. It happened with a viral respiratory thing or the flu. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. The patient stated that she would call her physician or the clinic &#34;today or tomorrow&#34;. She had not been to a doctor since her asthma flared up. Her respiratory doctor/pulmonologist moved away, there was no respiratory doctor nearby right now. So, her general practitioner was following her because it was a mild case and she had mild asthma. If it was severe, her doctor would make her go to a specialist. Relevant tests were reported as no. The patient used to be followed with pulmonary function tests until her respiratory doctor moved away. The patient stated that she took care of her 94 year old mother several days a week and because of all of the variances coming out, she thought it was her civic duty to prevent it from spreading through the population and creating more variances which was why she received the vaccine. She stated her doses were scheduled a month apart because they expecting to get a shipment of Moderna and they did not. They had to run to Buffalo to get the Pfizer vaccine, but they left her doses scheduled a month apart because the appointments were so hard to get. Normally, it would be 3 weeks. Her card clearly said Pfizer and they told her Pfizer, and they told her the reason for it being scheduled at 4 weeks. The patient called to inquire whether asthma flare-ups had been seen in clinical trials. It was not a reported side effect from the paperwork she received. When she looked online, she could not really find anything. She was thinking of going to a clinic but was wondering if there were any reports of flare-ups with asthma with the vaccine. With regards to causality, the patient stated it was a concern because she usually did not get a flare-up unless she was sick. She stated that there were many variables, and that it was spring, and bugs were out, but she did not usually get a flare-up like this. She stated that maybe it was a challenge to her immune system, the antibodies, but she did not know. She suspected the flare-up was related to the vaccine, but she did not have any idea. She would say yes, but she had no way of knowing. The flare-up usually only appeared if she got ill or something weird happened to her.  The clinical outcomes of the events flu-like symptoms, fever, achy and fatigue were recovered/resolved on 27Mar2021; sore arm and headache were recovered/resolved on 28Mar2021; asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were not recovered/not resolved; she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia were unknown. The reporter believed there was a reasonable possibility that the events sore arm, flu-like symptoms, asthma flare-up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were related to BNT162B2.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information the events asthma flare-ups and viral pneumonia are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, unlikely related to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Eyes started hurting with burning sensation, pressure in both ears and slight numbness across face from ear to ear and under nose.  Uncomfortable tightness in chest and a lot of pressure on face feeling like it was hot. I felt a little better after 15 minutes while waiting but never told anyone about symptoms. I walked out and drove home but monitored my symptoms.  The symptoms gradually became less and were gone after 1 hour and 45 minutes. I took a dose of benadryl at that time.  I slept well that night and woke up with no symptoms and none since.

The patient returned to the observation area after 1:30 pm complaining of symptom onset at approximately 1:35 pm of &#34;wooziness&#34;, faster heart beat, and legs tingling.  She did not want medical help but stayed for an hour of observation in which her blood pressure was taken at least twice in the normal range, sat with her legs elevated for a few minutes but not most of that time.  At 2:30pm  she reported not feeling any better but now reported tingling in hand and leg of her right side only.  BP/hr at 2:35pm were 121/96 and 112 from a seated position and both legs on floor. The patient said she would touch base with her physician who is unnamed. She was also given information and encouraged to fill a report herself with VAERS.

A 69-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included R.A.D., osteopenia, migraine with aura, the patient had previously suffered episodes of vasal vagal syncopy when she got the flu or other severe illnesses, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included atenolol, atorvastatin, azelastine, and fluticasone. The patient previously took gramicidin, neomycin sulfate, polymyxin b sulfate (NEOSPORIN) and experienced allergies. The morning after receiving the vaccine, she felt quite sick, like she had the flu. When she got up from bed and went to the bathroom to urinate, she became very lightheaded and dizzy. She attempted to return to bed, but passed out on the bedroom floor before she could get to the bed, and seized while she was unconscious. Once she came to, she was helped to bed and, after about 90 minutes, felt much better, and got up, and ate food and had coffee. All events occurred at 07:30 AM on 09Jan2021. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I became weak and thought I was going to faint. I called the medical professional over and they brought me into a staged area for triage. My blood pressure was 171/ 104 or 114. I had chest pain. The EMT did and EKG, listened to my heart, and started an IV. The ambulance was called and I was transported by ambulance to the hospital. At the hospital another EKG was taken, blood pressure and blood work. Repeated blood work was taken. I was admitted to the hospital due to elevation of tyoponin level and chest pain. The following day 1/22/21 I saw my PCP and he thought it was related to the vaccine and recommended a cardiologist for the increased levels of tyoponin and chest pain.  The cardiologist performed another EKG&lt; more blood work and performed a cardiac catheterization and a ECO. Both were normal. Prior to that I was given a nitro pill as my chest pain was between a 7 and a 8; a few minutes later the nurse asked about my pain level and it was a 3-4. I was given another nitro pill and shortly after I felt extremely faint and my blood pressure was 56/32. I was immediately given a bolus of saline IV . The chest pain continued through the day. The following day, I had no further chest pain, my tyoponin levels returned to normal and I was released from the hospital.

So then i left it alone because I didn&#39;t now if that was part of a reaction. When i got home i still had the odor in my mouth. i drank cold water and it went away. I waited. I felt sore on my arm but it wasn&#39;t that bad but as the hours went on it started getting more sore and painful. My arm was sore up to my shoulder and the back. After that the pain started traveling towards to my chest and i started getting pain in my chest. i took Tylenol (1 500 mg extra strength at 11:15 PM). So i waited 15 minutes to go to sleep. i got up the next day and everything was the same, i started putting ice on it and gave it time. I took another Tylenol but the pain was in my chest again a little bit. The third day the pain didn&#39;t come back in my chest and from then i was alright. I also started getting an itch.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 14Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included left hip replaced on 16Nov2020 and had her right hip replaced on 29Dec2020. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported that she got the shot at 1:30 pm and on the way home she started getting tired and exhausted on 14Jan2021. She got home and went right to bed. She felt like she couldn&#39;t stay awake, fell asleep and woke up about 6 pm then with a temperature of 105.5 and stated it would fluctuate between 104-105. She was just feeling horrible. At 7:30 pm, patient had a temperature of 103.5 and at 7:45 pm, her temperature was 104. On 14Jan2021, patient stated that she couldn&#39;t see straight, had blurred vision, having trouble walking, her balance was off and falling into walls. Her body was jerking and the arm that she got the injection in was dropping. Patient called her cardiology office, and was advised to take Tylenol 3-4 times per day and alternate it with Motrin. She was also taking coated 325 mg aspirin. She can hold her head up and was not jerking as much as she was. She was doing noticeably better. Patient had put ice bags on her groin, stomach and throat to try to cool down through the night. This brought temperature down to 103. She woke up at 12 am she was 102. Her temperature at the time of report was around 101-102. She took her blood pressure it was going crazy, first it was up around 163/71 and then over time it was really low 118/58 and heart rate was 130 for a while and went to 103. The back of her neck still felt so weak and she still feels extremely weak and exhausted. She went on to report that her HR was high and B/P was up but since then it has come down. The night of 14Jan2021, her b/p was low.On 14Jan2021, patient was also real thirsty and her urine was darker and was probably dehydrated and thought that she was real jerky muscle-wise, like she is not in control of anything last night. That she has not taken BP or heart rate on 15Jan2021, but it was not pounding today though. She was doing better today at the time of report. Patient was recovering from the events of fever, blurred vision, and balance was off; not recovered from tired, jerking, and dehydration. Outcome of remaining events was unknown.

The next morning (01/30/21) at @ 10:45 am I experienced an extremely rapid heart rate (195&#43;) which did not go down even after laying down and putting my feet up.  My husband took me to the hospital ER and they  gave me cardizem (10 mg via I?ve) which brought it down.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis, ongoing high cholesterol,  ongoing high blood pressure, celiac disease from 2005 (this has been tested too many times to count and it has been negative since after initial diagnosis 2005), arthritis (all her life) ongoing, hip replacement surgeries first done in 2005; repair of same hip in 2015; other hip in 2017. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Historical vaccines include Pneumonia Vaccine, Shingles Vaccine and Flu vaccines; all on an unspecified date for immunization. She never had adverse events with those. Ongoing concomitant medications included rosuvastatin (5 mg tablet) for high cholesterol, mesalamine (400 mg capsule) for ulcerative colitis and lisinopril from 2018 for high blood pressure. According to the patient, she knows that mesalamine is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory to keep inflammation in the colon down. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021 14:30 with immunosuppressant mesalamine. The night of 14Jan2021 patient had headache, chills, body aches, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and dizziness like Covid 19 symptoms. She went to the ER during the past 11 days for IV fluids due to deyhydration from the diarrhea. Today, 25Jan2021 is the first day she has been out of the house, except to go to the ER, since she received her 1st vaccine dose. On Jan2021 muscle pain, neck ache, backache, problems with balance and problems with walking. Events probably started with intense diarrhea starting 14Jan2021; then Fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit and chills 14Jan2021; Specific onset dates and onset times unknown otherwise other than between 14Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 onset dates. It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

                                                Within 10 seconds I began to feel that something was wrong.   A full body response of a swirling congestion, extreme weakness. very blurry vision and couldn&#39;t think straight.  I had trouble walking to recovery room, felt nauseous and weak and had a very fast heartrate.  I had to stay in private recovery room for 45 min.  I was still very ill and nervous at this point.   I left with a family member and asked to be driven to the nearby hospital emergency room.  For a precaution .  We parked across from ER entrance for another 1 hour till I slowly regained strength to 50% normalcy.  I went home afterwards and had to go to bed. I was unable to drive my own vehicle home.  Day 2, still feel weak, shaky and not normal.  I consider this a serious adverse reaction that did not receive medical intervention but will prevent me from getting the second Pfizer shot.  After 5 hours post injection I felt 60% normal .  Day 2, 70 per cent normal.   The vaccination facility was not able to do blood pressure monitoring ( which is a problem for anyone experiencing reactions.)  They said their protocol was to call 911/ambulance.   My blood pressure was checked by a certified PA with professional equipment at the 3 hour post injection time and the diastolic pressure was still below 50.  And heart rate above normal.  Still weak and nauseous.

                                                A day after the vaccine, she experienced shortness of breath.  This worsened and as a result, triggered a COPD episode which also led to Tachycardia.  Her heart rate was 170 and she could not breath.  She had to be rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3248, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 24Jan2021 07:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetic. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient&#39;s granddaughter had COVID virus and passed to the patient. The 2nd dose appointment scheduled for 14Feb2021. Patient stated she had the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 24Jan2021 at 0715AM in the right arm. After that, she found out she got infected with COVID 19. On 01Feb2021, she tested positive for COVID 19. On 28Jan2021 (also reported as on 28Jan20201 or 29Jan2021), she was feeling bad. Her little granddaughter had COVID virus (was infected at the school) and passed it on to her. Now she has been going to different places checking it out and she went to urgent care because her heart was beating fast on 02Feb2021. She had an electrocardiogram and her lungs were okay on an unspecified date. They told her was eligible to get an infusion but she doesn&#39;t know what it is. The urgent care clinic told her she could get the infusion but then she can&#39;t get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She wants to ask if this is true. She was being offered a monoclonal antibody infusion. When ask if this is the first time to call, she stated she called once before right after she found out that she had the COVID 19 infection to ask if she could still get the second shot. She did report at that time that she had gotten the first dose and then tested positive for COVID 19 and she previously provided product information including the lot number from her vaccine card.

                                                crazy blood pressure fluctuations the highest was 188/89/BP was around 159 or 150 then it came down to 136/71; feeling real jittery; hot flush feeling like an adrenaline rush in her upper chest and arms; heart pounding/highest pulse was 106; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EM5318), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper arm on 09Feb2021 at 11:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included premature ventricular contractions (PVC) from an unknown date wherein her pulse goes up into the 120s and had to go to the ER. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Pneumovax 23 on 14Jan2021. The patient called about the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The patient had the shot on 09Feb2021 and the 10th she was fine then on 11Feb2021, she started having side effects. She is calling it side effects but what she is describing, she has these episodes periodically but she has not had one in 2 years but it was bad one and it happened 2 days after her vaccine, she is not sure if it was side effect but she doesn&#39;t want to mess with it so she wants to tell someone. On 11Feb2021, the reaction started around 1:30 PM. She started feeling real jittery, she was hot flush feeling like an adrenaline rush in her upper chest and arms down to her elbows. She could feel her heart pounding and she had these before but no one seems to know what causes it. She worked with it she was busy doing other things then around 4PM that day it started getting worse. She could tell her blood pressure was getting involved. She started taking her blood pressure, from 4:30 on until 12:30AM she had crazy blood pressure fluctuations the highest was 188/89 and the highest pulse was 106 but it goes up to 188 and then it would be 158, 179, 155, 119, 166 and those are the top number of the blood pressure. Her pulse pretty much stayed high 80s 90s except for the time it was 106. After midnight, her BP was around 159 or 150 then it came down to 136/71 and her pulse was 78 and she slept much better, she slept for 4 hours she woke up feeling like heart pounding but her blood pressure was 125/69 and her pulse was 74. She also has PVC and sometimes they say when she feels her heart pounding and her blood pressure and pulse are fine, they said that is probably PVC. When her blood pressure and pulse goes way up she is miserable. She had it so that her pulse goes up into the 120s with this and she has had to go to ER before. She clarifies her pulse being in the 120s and having to go the ER was in the past, prior to the vaccine. She says no one can figure out what it is. Some said it was anxiety, she sat through a whole program on anxiety and they decided not that is not what it is. But the fact that she hadn&#39;t had one of these episodes in 2 years and she had a good sized one 2 days after the vaccine, she had a really hard one that is why she thought she better report it. It has definitely gotten better she still feels jittery and heat flush every once in a while, but her blood pressure is fine. It is 139/74 and pulse 74. She can tell its still there but improved and certainly not uncomfortable. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or the physician&#39;s office but she contacted her doctor&#39;s office and she has an online thing with them in a half an hour from the time of the report. The outcome of the event crazy blood pressure fluctuations the highest was 188/89/bp was around 159 or 150 then it came down to 136/71 and heart pounding/highest pulse was 106 was recovering while the outcome of the events feeling real jittery and hot flush feeling like an adrenaline rush in her upper chest and arms was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event  blood pressure fluctuation cannot be excluded. The cardiovascular medical history is likewise a risk factor.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 26Feb2021 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) and vitamin. The patient previously took BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (first dose on the left arm at 01:30 PM, lot number: EL 1283); and SHINGRIX vaccine in 2019, codeine and cipro and experienced allergies. On 27Feb2021 03:30 PM, the patient experienced chills, fatigue &amp; then sudden nausea &amp; lightheadedness that resulted in passing out. Unfortunately, the patient fell on a tile floor &amp; hit her head resulting in a 1.5 inch gash in the back of her head. When she went to the ER, it was determined that she now had vertigo (which she never had before) but obviously hard to tell if it was a side effect of the vaccine or from the fall. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the events which included CT scan, ekg, chest X-ray, bloodwk (unknown results) and Epley maneuver. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On 3/24, I woke up nauseous, extremely fatigued, with sore joints, headache, and abdominal pain.  A few days later I noticed I had extreme shortness of breath.  I went to see my PCP on or about 3/31.  He listened to my heart and discovered a rapid heartbeat.  He then took an EKG.  He wanted to put me on lifetime meds immediately.  I was in shock because I truly believe this is a reaction to the COVID vaccine.  I have never had arrhythmia.  In fact, I had a wellness visit with the Dr. about 3 months previously and all was good.  I have been seeing him for four years since I moved.  He does not think my new diagnosis is related to a vaccine reaction, but I find it highly suspect that 4 other women in my large circle of friends also have AFIB after 2nd shot. I spent Easter in the ER and they pumped Metoprolol in my bloodstream.  I did not stay in the hospital that night.  I went to see the Dr. on Monday morning on 4/4.  He prescribed Metroprolol 25 mg and Xarelto 20 mg IMMEDIATELY.  I picked up the meds and started this regimen.  In speaking with other women, I believe this terrible diagnosis is a direct result as a reaction from the vaccine.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her daughter. This is the first of two cases.   A 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), the first dose administered in the right arm on 14Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) and the second dose administered in the left arm on 03Apr2021 at 10:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737), both intramuscular as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure both diagnosed 5 years ago, GERD and hypercholesteremia, all ongoing. The patient was a former smoker but has been smoke-free for 15 years. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken for hypercholesterolaemia from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lisinopril (manufacturer unknown) taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; metformin (manufacturer unknown) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and omeprazole (manufacturer unknown) taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing.  The patient did not have any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that she and her daughter had their second dose of the vaccine on 03Apr2021. The patient tested positive for Covid. The patient developed shortness of breath on Sunday, 11Apr2021, and ended up with a pulmonary embolism. The patient doesn&#39;t know if she was possibly infected before they got the second vaccine and were asymptomatic and unknown or did they get infected when got they got the vaccine with thousands of other people. At the time of the report, the patient was mostly resolved and they are all home. She became short of breath, had severe cough and headache and she went to the ER and on the CAT scan they discovered she had a small pulmonary emboli. She was hospitalized from 11Apr2021-12Apr2021. The patient was given Eliquis and monoclonal antibodies as treatment for the events. The patient stated that she will be on Eliquis for the next month because of the pulmonary embolism. The patient did not need any additional therapies for COVID-19. The patient did not have any pre-existing diseases that worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection. The outcome of the event &#39;tested positive for Covid/shortness of breath/severe cough/headache&#39; was not recovered while the outcome of the event pulmonary embolism was recovering. The relatedness of the suspect drug to the reactions  was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears reasonable that the suspect drug did not contribute to the development of the reported event pulmonary embolism, that most likely was related to the concurrent development of COVID-19.

Caller states they gave her a paper on the vaccine, it says they put some type of medication in the vaccine that has cholesterol in it. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 29Mar2021 at 09:20 (at the age of 69-year-old) at hospital facility as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no relevant medical history. Patient reported that she has people in the family that have had heart problems. Concomitant medication included unspecified vitamins. Historical vaccine includes first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9990 or EM9890) administered in the right arm on 08Mar2021 (at the age of 69-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and had a little fast heart rate but not constant, little fatigue and site pain. The patient previously took steroid injections 2 years ago (2019) and had heart palpitations before. The patient further mentioned that normally after the steroids wear off, the heart palpitations go away. The patient reported that she did not have any problems following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she had a little fatigue and site pain for just a couple of days but that everything was fine. Patient reported that she felt a little heart palpitations for maybe a day or two and then it was gone following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. After she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, she noticed the heart palpitations again and a little shortness of breath. The heart palpitations and shortness of breath were nothing that she felt that she had to run to the emergency room or anything over. The patient reported that now it was getting difficult for her to sleep sometimes at night because of the heart rate. The patient also reported that she was trying to figure out that from this length of time between her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021 and time of call on 14Apr2021, could the heart palpitations be a side effect from the COVID-19 vaccine. Patient also mentioned that when she experienced heart palpitations before, a whole work up was ordered and she was referred to cardiology and that nothing was found during the work up after previous experience with heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that she has been fine, that she has been able to work and walk and that she gets her 10,000 steps every day. After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, she was tired and didn&#39;t feel like her normal self. The patient also reported that when the time had arrived to get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, about a week before, she may have had a little fast heart rate but not constant. It was also reported that following her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, the fatigue started about the same time as it did following the first dose, on the second day post-vaccine on 30Mar2021. Patient reported that she was kind of tired and just taking a nap during the day. The fatigue was still ongoing. It was also reported that patient was starting to feel better other than the heart palpitations. The patient reported that yesterday, 13Apr2021, she felt great and could do her normal routine, other than feeling chest pains and palpitations. The heart palpitations are not constant, but are more regular during the day than she was used to. The heart palpitations were really bad last night, 13Apr2021, and that she had difficulty sleeping because of heart rate (couldn&#39;t hardly sleep at all). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for an echocardiogram. The patient&#39;s doctor did an electrocardiogram (EKG) on her on 08Apr2021 and there was nothing there (normal). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for a stress echocardiogram. The patient also mentioned that after returning from the physician&#39;s office, her husband went back and looked at the symptoms from the COVID-19 vaccine information sheet. The patient reported that her husband thought that she needed to call to eliminate everything, that they are trying to figure out why the patient was experiencing the heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that 2 days ago she got on her treadmill to walk and went for 30 minutes. Patient reported that it normally takes her 5 minutes to recuperate, but that time it took her 20 minutes before she felt comfortable after her walk. The patient also reported that the site pain was nothing serious following both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The site pain began shortly after receiving the vaccine and went away after the second day following both vaccines. The shortness of breath probably started about 5 days after she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The shortness of breath wasn&#39;t enough that she felt that she needed to run to the emergency room. It just felt like when she would breathe, especially at night as she normally breathes with her mouth closed at night, the patient felt like she had to open her mouth to breathe because she can still feel the pressure in chest. The patient was still experiencing the heart palpitations. The heart palpitations are a little worse because they happen so often. Patient reported that initially, she would have a few heart palpitations and then go for hours with none. Patient reported that now, she was feeling the heart palpitations quite a bit. Patient reported that it feels kind of like a little pressure in her chest and then it&#39;ll feel like little flutters. The patient further reported that she experiences a little pressure in her chest when she experiences the heart palpitations. At times, the chest pressure would go away, but she always feels the chest pressure there now. The chest pressure has gotten worse over the past couple of weeks and that she was thinking that it would go away like the first one did. Patient reported that she went to the doctor last week and was given an EKG. Patient reported that the EKG was fine and that her physician was scheduling other tests to make sure it&#39;s nothing with her heart. The patient didn&#39;t think that the heart palpitations and shortness of breath were from the COVID-19 vaccine, but that her husband looked at the vaccine information paper after her doctor&#39;s appointment and said she should call Pfizer. The patient had not yet recovered from heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pressure while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

                                                Low platelets; Rash on her body; Bruising; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus since 2011 (reported diagnosed 10 years from this report, ongoing congenital heart defect which patient was born with but did not find out until she was in her 50s; does not bother her too  much; one of the major arteries has a 90 degree angle vs. an S curve, mild multiple sclerosis; no longer has this as she has not had another relapse; she was diagnosed almost 30 years ago; she has never had another attack since she had 2 of them and was on medication that did damage to her liver, breast cancer; patient is a breast cancer survivor and issues with magnesium levels. There were no concomitant medications. On 28Jan2021 the patient had blood work done for her kidney doctor. They withdrew blood from her arm. They had a hard time stopping the bleeding afterwards. They finally got it to stop and put regular cotton balls and a band aid on it. By the time she was walking out she was bleeding out of her arm she felt in her coat. They were able to stop the bleeding again. This was at about 10 AM. Patient went home and afterwards was called back and instructed to go to the ER for critical care. Her platelets were low at 10,000 at that time. They got to the ER and they checked her platelets and they were down to 8,000. They administered some steroids; Prednisone. They decided to admit her after giving the treatment in the ER. After that her platelets came back to 11,000. The next morning on 29Jan2021 her platelet count was 7,000. They started administering the same drug through an IV. He thinks it was still a steroid. They did it in smaller amounts and overnight the next day her platelets were up to 26,000 on 30Jan2021. They continued the treatment during the night again and on Sunday they were 36,000 and they released her that day late on Sunday. They went back and did blood work yesterday on 01Feb2021. The local doctor said her platelets are up to 61,000. The patient was getting blood work every Monday and Thursday for 3 weeks. Th patient had blood work and platelets checked before the vaccine and they were normal. The patient was hospitalized from 28Jan2021 to 31Jan2021 due to the event. The patient also noticed rash on her body and bruising maybe on 21Jan2021 or 22Jan2021. The bruising was really bad on her left hand by her wrist. It was really dark. She was also bruised everywhere they poked her with an IV and bruises where they put the heart monitor on her and pressed down to stick it to her. The bruising is still all over her body. It has stayed about the same. The one on her hand is still severe. The other from where she has been poked are starting to clear up. Overall it was about the same. The outcome of event bruising was not recovered, low platelets was unknown while rash on her body recovered on unspecified date.

                                                shingles/I&#39;ve had shingles before, this was the 4th time; shingles/I&#39;ve had shingles before, this was the 4th time; kidney infection; hurting on my waist around the back; diverticulitis; Her blood pressure went up to 211/92; does not feel well; afraid of taking it if it will be any worse; sick; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot: EL3248, expiry 30Apr2021), intramuscular on 23Jan2021 08:15 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization (prevention because she has autoimmune). Medical history included Behcet&#39;s syndrome and Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, both are overactive immune system problem/autoimmune diseases, which were diagnosed 20 years ago; diagnosed allergies; compromised immune status; respiratory illness; genetic chromosomal abnormalities; endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity; and patient have had shingles before. Family history was reported as none. Concomitantly, she was just taking daily medications that were not relevant. There was no prescriber for the vaccine.  It was through a hospital. It was reported that vaccination was given at 08:15 to 08:30. Patient had no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). No additional vaccines administered the same date of the Pfizer suspect.  Patient had not had prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Patient received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. She stated, on Tuesday 26Jan2021, patient was hurting on the waist around the back. On Wednesday, 27Jan2021, that next morning, she went to see her internal doctor and they thought a kidney infection or not; he was not sure if she had a kidney infection or what was going on. Patient went home and it got worse and patient went to the ER (Jan2021), also reported as ended up going to the ER. They did a CT scan gave her medicine. They did a CT scan and said it was not her bladder or anything (Jan2021). They thought it was diverticulitis; nothing helped. They gave her medication and she kept getting sick (2021).  No further details provided on medication given. On Friday, 29Jan2021, early morning, patient went back to the ER, they did another CT with contrast it wasn&#39;t diverticulitis, but it was shingles, and patient have had shingles before, this was the 4th time. It was reported that when the doctor came in, he thought this was shingles and she has had shingles previously. She has had it about 3 other times and the pain was just off the scale (Jan2021).  Her blood pressure went up to 211/92 and they were giving her morphine for the pain (Jan2021).  She was questioning if she should get the second dose. She has two autoimmune diseases and it was an overactive immune disease.  She took the one vaccine and her doctor said to contact Pfizer being as it is kind of new and especially since she has the autoimmune issues.  She would like to know if it is safe for her to have the second vaccine.  She does not know if she will be over this.  She does not feel well (Jan2021).  She was afraid of taking it if it will be any worse (Jan2021). Patient felt all right until she had the vaccine, on Tuesday the problem started (26Jan2021). They were giving her medication for the shingles and for the pain. Patient stated that &#34;it set something off&#34;. Patient was still sick (2021), still taking pain pills. Patient didn&#39;t know how many days she has. Her second vaccine is on 13Feb2021. As sick as she has been, and her overactive immune system and if she still has the shingles those can last a long time, she doesn&#39;t want to go through what she went through. This was a lot of pain and with shingles they can last, 6 months or a year. The nurse called her back and told her to report to Pfizer. Patient was taking the medicine for the shingles right now. She doesn&#39;t know what will happen. She doesn&#39;t want to be sick. Patient asked for the efficacy after 1 dose and how much protection it has. She did fill out something because she talked with someone else.  She confirmed it was through VAERS and not with Pfizer. She said the pain around her waist was a little better because they gave her the medicine for shingles and she has pain pills. She said one was Valacyclovir and she could not remember the name of the other. Patient had required two trips to ER.  First one was on 27Jan2021 and went to internal medicine doctor and that night went to the ER.  They did CT scan and it was not bladder or anything. Second visit on 29Jan2021 and did CT with contrast and the doctor thought it was shingles since she had shingles three times before.  She has had them internally.  The doctor said it would not necessarily need to be externally break outs.  The next two times she did not break out.  She did not have anything around her waist. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events hurting on my waist around the back, kidney infection, diverticulitis, shingles, and sick. The outcome of the event hurting on my waist around the back was recovering. The outcome of the event kidney infection, diverticulitis, shingles, sick, blood pressure went up to 211/92, does not feel well, and &#34;afraid of taking it if it will be any worse&#34; was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient (who was not pregnant at the time of vaccine) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number; el3249) via an unspecified route of administration, at right arm on 14Jan2021 14:00, at hospital for COVID-19 Immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), GERD (Gastrooesophageal reflux disease), oral cancer 2020 with surgery only, arthritis, hypothryroid and allergies to nickel. Concomitant medications included, irbesartan (AVAPRO), levothyroxine, liothyronine (NP THYROID), lansoprazole (PREVACID), ibuprofen (MOTRIN) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took metoclopramide (REGLAN) and prochlorperazine edisylate (COMPAZINE); patient had allergies to both drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. List of medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination, included: avapro, np thyroid, prevacid, motrin, Tylenol. On 14Jan2021 at 14:15 (after 15 minutes of dose), the patient experienced feeling very hot, lips numb and tingly, headache, dizzy, heart beating hard in chest, anxiety, waited another 15 minutes, taken to ER (Emergency Room) on site; elevated blood pressure, nausea with dry heaves. Patient was taken into Emergency room/department for urgent care and received treatment IV solumedrol, ativan and zofran, oral Benadryl. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date in 2021; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events headache and nausea were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other reported serious events with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

There was a sense of nausea initially but it went away. There was pronounced feeling of heat located subcutaneously on my right outer thigh. It came and went about every minute or so. (I counted the seconds in between each incident). I am still experiencing flu like symptoms (bodily aches, slight headache, mild chest pain, and general ill-feeling.) I will contact my primary care physician today about my concerns but felt it necessary to document these mild but disturbing side effects.

                                                Patient was alert and conversational throughout first COVID-19 Pfizer vaccination. During post vaccination waiting period, patient became unresponsive and exhibited convulsion like movements in her waiting chair. Pharmacist quickly evaluated patient and patient was only minimally responsive to painful stimuli only. Breathing was rapid, shallow, and irregular with an expiratory wheeze heard upon auscultation. Patient was slouched in chair but supporting self and had a strong grip with her left hand. Skin condition was warm but diaphoretic. Ambulance 911 service was called. No swelling of the throat, mouth, face, nor lips was seen. Patient continued to be non-responsive, with non-comprehensible sounds, and was not opening eyes or following commands. Due to worsening ability to breath and wheezing on expiration, epinephrine 0.3 mg was administered intramuscularly into the left thigh at 1230 on 2/25/2021. Approximately 5 minutes after epinephrine administration, the patient?s work of breathing improved, wheezing was diminished upon expiration, and respiratory rate had slowed to 16 breaths per minutes. BP was 160s/80s and HR 98 (after epinephrine administration). Patient began opening eyes spontaneously but was still not following commands. Ambulance service then arrived, report was given, and patient was transported to Hospital Emergency Department.   Patient was under the care of Doctor at the emergency department and received albuterol/ipratropium nebulization, dexamethasone 10 mg Iv, famotidine 20 mg IV, and magnesium sulfate 2 g IV. After the physician evaluated the patient and talked with family, the patient?s family stated that the patient has a history of anxiety related reactions such as this with convulsion like activity. Doctor then determined that the patient did not have an anaphylactic/allergic reaction and instead had a anxiety related vasovagal type reaction. Doctor stated that the patient could receive the second COVID-19 vaccine dose in 3 weeks without issue. Patient then discharged from Emergency Department (unsure if AMA). Patient then presented to the pharmacy with her daughter after discharge to fill in staff on the outcome of the reaction. Patient appeared to be at baseline mentally and physically.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number EN6205) via unspecified route of administration on unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was not provided. Upon 15 minutes after injection, she noted nausea with belching and had some SOB. Symptoms worsened as she ambulated over to the medical bay along with her chest pressure. She denied rash, hives, welts, hoarseness, stridor, itching, lightheadedness, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. Patient reported recently admitted for unstable angina and CAD with tachycardia. Patient had elevated d-dimer and blood clot was ruled out. Patient discontinued on new medication, beta blocker. Since discharge this Sunday 21Feb2021, she reported chest heaviness as if she has &#34;cardboard on chest.&#34; Can slightly increase with going up and down stairs or increased activity. She states she had reached out to her cardiologist via an online site but has not heard back. Patient stated her pain is about the same today. Patient complains of chest tightness and shortness of breath. The outcome of events was unknown.   No Follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of events unstable angina and tachycardia cannot be excluded. The patient&#39;s age and suspected cardiac condition are risk factors. The event CAD, given its progressive nature, is most likely an underlying condition, thus unrelated to the suspect drug.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The possibility that suspect drug may have contributed to the reported event cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 70-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 70-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included viruses, flus (I have had viruses, flus my whole life), five surgeries, gallbladder removed, and asthma, all from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) on an unspecified date, at the age of 70-years-old and experienced a very sore arm. On an unspecified date in Feb2021 the patient experienced, &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34;. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;I wanted to call today because I got the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 3 weeks ago, 03Feb2021 it was. After the first dose I had a very sore arm and that was it. It was more sore than normal vaccine, but it was that was all I had. After the second dose I was not aware that I would get sick to the extreme that I did. I found out afterwards that other people have said this, I did not know at the time. I thought I was going to die. I am a 70-year-old woman, I am not young, and I have had viruses, flus my whole life and I got so sick. First, I had over a 103 temperature, it came on suddenly, 12 hours to the minute after I got the vaccine. On top of that I had such bad chills I never saw anything like that in my life, 5 blankets on top of me, sweaters, sweatshirts and the fever was so high. I could not keep the Tylenol down because I had nausea and I would throw it up. So, I could not even get rid of it. Then on top of that my arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all, plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain, it was excruciating. I have had 5 surgeries, my arm hurt worse than all 5 surgeries put together. And I had my gall bladder removed and everything, nothing hurt to this extent. Now also I have asthma, nothing severe but I do have asthma, so I have one of those little oximeters and you put it on your finger and it checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91, all night it was 91, my chest was shortness of breath. I was ready to go to the hospital. And I did not know it was going to be that bad.&#34; When clarified about the treatment the patient stated that &#34;yes, the Tylenol helped once I could hold it down. The doctor gave me something to stop the vomiting and the nausea. And then I could take the Tylenol and then the Tylenol worked great. But at first, I was so sick I could not hold the Tylenol down in my stomach I would throw it up, that was the problem.&#34; When asked about lab work the patient stated that she had not had lab work done since the first vaccine. She stated that she had stayed in the house because she had other health issues and was afraid to come out for 11 months. So she had not gone out to get anything done. The patient stated that she called because if a third dose was needed, she suggested that a smaller dose be given to small people. She stated that she took childrens medicine most of the time because she was tiny. She wanted to know if Pfizer in the future would be making doses for small people and doses for bigger people. Her suggestion was to have a separate booster to go by weight or by gender, men usually did not experience the same. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34; were all recovered/resolved on unspecified dates.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E18982), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:00 by injection once to left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) as blood thinner. Patient was calling about COVID 19 vaccine. She had the first shot 21Jan2021, and had had flu symptoms ever since on 21Jan2021 and when they gave the shot they didn&#39;t ask for her allergies or anything, and she read on a letter given after, she was taking blood thinners, she was not sure what they do to the vaccine, that wasn&#39;t asked of her either, before she decided whether to take second or not, she needed some answers, she hadn&#39;t had the flu for 40 years. Her shot was at 1PM, and about 6 or 7PM that night, she got hot and thought she would pass out and it went downhill from there. Patient did not have some medical problems that she checked off when she registered, none of that came through either. Patient was thinking about not taking the second shot if she didn&#39;t get some medical information. The outcome of event flu symptoms was resolving, outcome of other events were unknown.

Medical history included breast cancer from 1988 to an unknown date , ovarian cancer from 2015 to an unknown date , she has had lymph nodes removed from her right arm &#34;30 years ago&#34; from 1988 to an unknown date, pass out from unknown date to unknown date. Concomitant medication included olaparib (LYNPARZA) taken for ovarian cancer from Feb2020 at 150mg, 2 tablets in the morning and 1-2 tablets at night by mouth.She says she is a little person and couldn&#39;t tolerate the side effects of that, so she varies how many she takes based on her side effects. She says she is supposed to take 300mg in the morning and 300mg at night. She says how she takes it is, she takes 150mg or one pill in the morning, then one or two at night depending on how she is doing. Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1, lot no: EL9264, route left arm for Covid-19 immunisation. Past drug history included on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out. The patient reported approximately 15 hours after the shot, on 21Feb2021 she had muscle spasms almost to seizure amount of shaking, full body muscle spasms. She clarifies that her side effects didn&#39;t kick in until 02:30AM on 21Feb2021. She says at 07:00AM on 21Feb2021 she got up and went into the bathroom and passed out, and had a low blood sugar episode she supposed.  She crashed unconscious to the floor. She said that could be from the shot, but she is also a high risk patient, a cancer patient, and is on a maintenance chemo drug. She says on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out, so she doesn&#39;t know if that was related to the COVID shot or not. No testing had been done on high risk patients, so she thought maybe this could be a good heads up for something someone else may experience. Her side effects were on and off for several hours, the shaking and spasms would subside and then start again.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal. Outcome of the injection site pain was recovered on 01Mar2021, of the difficulty breathing was recovering, of the headache, chills, fever, dizziness, weakness, and felt sick was not recovered, while of the remaining events was unknown.

Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 70-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EP6955), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 22Mar2021 at 16:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EN6198) on 25Feb2021 at 15:00 on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and reported that her blood pressure went sky high and it continued to be high and her heart rate was up and caused her to go to urgent care. The patient also previously received a flu vaccine on an unspecified date and her arm was sore for 3 weeks and she felt like she had the flu for 3 days. The patient reported that after she got her second vaccine she had the normal, what people call normal reaction, of feeling sick and stuff on 27Mar2021 then she ended up in the hospital her blood pressure was way up, it was at 188 and she forgets what the bottom number was. She went in because she felt like she was having a heart attack there was a pain in chest like right where the middle of a bra would be. It lasted about 15 or 20 minutes. That is her experience with the vaccine, it is raised blood pressure and she is still dealing with it her blood pressure is still high. She tries not to be scared but the doctors at the hospital made her a little nervous that is why she spent the night but that is a definite side effect. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 27Mar2021 and was discharged on 28Mar2021. They wanted to keep her for 2 nights and do a stress test and she said no way she is not staying for 3 nights in that hospital, the nurses were outstanding they were the most efficient nurses but the hospital food sucked and she got no sleep. Also, on her right arm she has a hidden rash between her hand and her elbow under the skin there is a rash that popped up with the vaccine on an unspecified date in Mar2021. The patient also stated that her blood type is O negative and she does not know she heard that O neg people weren&#39;t going to get COVID and she has never got COVID before. The patient also reported that they drew blood 6 times in the hospital to see if she had a heart attack and everything came back negative. it just so happens she had a echocardiogram the day after the first dose was given and her blood pressure was elevated that day but everything was fine. She says it is not relevant but she tested for that out of precaution, her doctor asked her to do that every 2 years and just so happened to fall on the day after the first dose. The patient received treatment for the events she ended up in the hospital her blood pressure was way up, it was at 188, felt like she was having a heart attack and pain in chest. The outcome of the event she ended up in the hospital her blood pressure was way up, it was at 188 was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

For whatever reason, she then went into her bedroom where he said she fell out. He noticed foam coming from her mouth and called 911. EMS was unable to revive her. She passed away at home.

A 70-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing thrombocytopenia  (diagnosed 4-5 years ago). No concomitant medications. Family medical history included high cholesterol. The patient previously received the first vaccine dose of BNT162B2 on 23Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunization. No adverse event (AE) following prior vaccinations. The patient&#39;s daughter stated that the patient seemed like she was having an adverse reaction since her second vaccination. The patient&#39;s daughter said that this started after her mother received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine last 16Mar2021. The patient&#39;s platelets have been significantly dropping. The patient was rushed to the hospital because platelets were down to 4,000 units. The patient had  thrombocytopenia but was managed well. The patient has Thrombocytopenia Disease and her hematologist recommended that she get the vaccine. Before the second vaccine, her platelets had been stable, not at normal range, but 78,000 to 71,000, which was normal for her. After the vaccine, the patient&#39;s platelet level has been significantly plummeting to single digits like 4,000 and then in a few hours shooting to 31,000 (in Mar2021). It was a consistent up and down for her. The patient was rushed to the hospital from her doctor&#39;s office and she was being admitted because her platelet level was down to 4,000 and she was getting a platelet transfusion. Ever since the patient got the vaccine, this started happening. Before, only once in a 3 year span, the patient&#39;s platelets dropped to 6,000 and now this is happening very often. The patient felt really weak for the last 2 days since 19Mar2021 (as reported) especially but it really started the same time as her platelets first dropped, so they took her to see the hematologist and fortunately they were able to get her in and did a complete blood count (CBC) and her platelets were down to 4,000 on 19Mar2021 (as reported). The treatment included Platelet Transfusions and was given steroid medication (they haven&#39;t received it yet but she was prescribed Promacta by Novartis). The patient has been in and out of the hospital 3 times within 2 weeks. Within a 2 week time frame, the patient has been there 3 times, 2 direct admit hospitalizations and 1 emergency room (ER) visit. She was rushed to the ER on either 05Apr2021 or 06Apr2021, but she was not admitted because when they took her labs at the doctor, her platelets were 4,000, but when they were rechecked in the ER they were 38,000 so the released her because it came up and was over 30,000. The patient was admitted to the hospital from her doctor&#39;s office on 09Apr2021 and released 10Apr2021. She was admitted to the hospital again on 14Apr2021. Event occurred after the second vaccine dose. The patient had a visit to physician&#39;s office for a couple of times. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.  After approximately 25 minutes, 911 was called and she was transported by ambulance to the emergency room in stable condition.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

Took BP meds (.5 mg Ramipril and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide). Waited 15 minutes and BP was 167/101. Waited another 15 minutes and BP was 149/91. Saw doctors PA in the afternoon, BP was 162/81.  PA administered EKG, blood work, and spent a significant amount of time listening to heart, lungs and carotid arteries. Everything was in normal range except sugars, but an A1C test was normal.  PA said to take an extra Ramipril at night and track BP at home for 7 days.  BP went down each day and on  2/26 was in normal range. However, after 7 days, she said to permanently stay on the evening addition of Ramipril.

A 71-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 (at the age of 71 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation; and paracetamol (TYLENOL), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dose and frequency for an unspecified indication. Medical history included high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, tinnitus, vertigo, blood cholesterol. Concomitant medications included amlodipine for high blood pressure, lovastatin for blood cholesterol, meclizine [MECLOZINE] for vertigo, dipyridamole for tinnitus, prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis, and folic acid. On 21Feb2021, the patient experienced rash (hospitalization) and fast heart beat. &#34;If this is the reaction, I guess I shouldn&#39;t take the second dose, right? I just think that I am not going to take second dose.&#34; Both the events required emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work, electrocardiogram (EKG) and x-ray and everything came back normal on 21Feb2021. Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the rash which included hydrocortisone. The action taken in response to the events with paracetamol was unknown. Outcome of both events was recovering.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                mild peripheral neuropathy/sensory peripheral neuropathy around her gums and lips on her left side, as well as tingling on 4 of the 5 fingers of her left hand; paralysis in her lips and gums all the way down to her finger tips on the side of the injection which was the left side; portion of the trigeminal nerve on the left side seemed to have been impacted; blood pressure had sky rocketed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician and a contactable consumer (patient). A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), lot no. EL9269, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The physician asked if there were any reports of paresthesia around the gums and/or tingling in the hands and fingers. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. About 1 week after receiving the vaccine (20Feb2021), she experienced symptom complex, consistent with a mild peripheral neuropathy/sensory peripheral neuropathy around her gums and lips on her left side, as well as tingling on 4 of the 5 fingers of her left hand, She was admitted and a full workup for central disorders and vascular disorders was negative (Feb2021). But her symptoms were continuing intermittently. She had numbness of the gums. A portion of the trigeminal nerve on the left side seemed to have been impacted. Also, peri-orally on the left side.  The physician asked if this symptom complex has been reported and if there were reports of these mild sensory peripheral neuropathies coming from the vaccine. The physician stated that any info on dental paresthesia or any reports of other incidents of sensory paresthesia would be very helpful. The patient also called about the COVID 19 vaccine. On 13Feb, she got the vaccine in and then one week later on the following Saturday, the date would have been 20Feb, she started having a sensation of tingling and paralysis in her lips and gums all the way down to her finger tips on the side of the injection which was the left side and that has continued. She went to see the doctor the following Monday 22Feb and not knowing what it was, she sent her to the ER she was kept overnight, she was discharged 23Feb but her symptoms persisted even through today. These sensations were happening on average 3 times per day, sometimes many more anywhere from 3 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes then it goes away. She did not go to her primary care. She confirmed her first dose was given 13Feb and the tingling and paralysis started the 20Feb it was still ongoing at this time. It has persisted but she can&#39;t tell whether it was getting better or not because sometimes it will last 3 minutes sometimes it will last 1 hour and 45 minutes. It started to effect other parts of her so she thinks it might be getting a little bit worse. It was starting to effect other parts of her body the progression goes, it started at the tip of her tongue and gums and then shortly within 30 seconds or less than a minute it spread to her upper and lower lip only on the left side and that was how it was on her gums as well it was only on the left side then she had the tingling in her finger tips on the left hand. She specified that she experienced these sensations on the tip of her tongue, left gums, lower left lip, and into the fingers on the left hand. She would like to know if these symptoms have been reported in association with the vaccine and if so, how long she can expect them to last. She stated that yesterday, a physician called in on her behalf for more information and said he received literature from 29Jan regarding reports that included information about dental paresthesia after the vaccine. She was planning not to get the second vaccine. She was not taking medications, she was in good health she did go and was admitted in the ER, they did a work up. Her blood pressure had sky rocketed on Feb2021 and since she mentioned sensation they ruled out a stroke. On Feb2021, they did blood work, MRI and CT scan and everything was they did not find anything linking to a stroke. She spent the night in observation. She was in the ER, they did put her in the main hospital but it was for observation from the emergency room. She went in on the 22Feb and was discharged home on 23Feb. She asked where this goes from here, these symptoms were concerning to her. She did not find any incidences at least in general of reporting this, asked if there were these kinds of things being reported, she didn&#39;t know how long it was going to last or if it will get worse. The outcome of blood pressure had sky rocketed was unknown while outcome of other events was not recovered.

                                                The patient initially presented (3/3/21) with headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise. Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved). Patient was appropriately treated for these conditions. Also, her known uncontrolled diabetes was treated. Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

A 71-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6201), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 16Feb2021 15:45, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ITP, from an unknown date. The patient had her first dose of bnt162b2 vaccine on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. Concomitant medication included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA). Platelet was dropped to 25 (units not specified). Patient&#39;s platelets was dropped all the way after the second dose (16Feb2021) and she had to take Prednisone. Start date of event, Nurse stated, 4 days later. (Confirmed the date as 19Feb2021). CBC Date: Nurse stated, Last one I had it was every day since the day before the vaccine and today. Results: Nurse stated, platelets went down to 12,000. Patient is now on Prednisone, so her platelets are up. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a plausible temporal association, a possible contributory role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the reported event platelets decreased cannot be excluded. The history of ITP may have provided the contribution to the event.

                                                allergic reaction/anaphylactic reaction; heart started pounding and racing; high blood pressure 220/118; throat felt funny; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable Nurse (Patient).  A 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 23Mar2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: Jul2021) at the age of 71-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included low magnesium, low vitamin D, allergy to Band-Aids, skin adhesives, and allergy to polyurethane spray tan (She&#39;s had a reaction to polyurethane on wood floors at her dad&#39;s house. Her throat started tightening and it was hard to breathe. She couldn&#39;t be in the house until they were finished with the floors. She had to stay in a hotel. She&#39;s also had a reaction to spray tan. After the spray tan was finished she had the tightness in her throat. She went to the emergency department and was given Benadryl and her reaction stopped after a short amount of time), She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; magnesium taken for low magnesium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D) taken for vitamin D decreased, start and stop date were not reported. The patient had allergy to Polysporin (Johnson and Johnson NDC30036385, Lot#103812, Expiry Jan2020), Polysporin caused a bad skin reaction, it was awful. She can only use plain bacitracin. Some make ups she can&#39;t use. She&#39;s had no problems with creams. Foods are ok. She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years ago and she put the polysporin on the wound and that&#39;s when she had that reaction. It was bad around the incision, that wound took a long time to heal because of that sensitivity. She also can&#39;t take zinc oxide because it caused an allergic skin reaction, she also had allergy to Epinephrine, She had a reaction happen to her at the dentist. She was given epinephrine and her heart started pounding and racing. The dentist put her in a shock position. The dentist told her it would pass but it was scary. The patient previously also received Antihistamine for allergy. The patient experienced heart started pounding and racing (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, high blood pressure 220/118 (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, throat felt funny (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, allergic reaction/anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 23Mar2021. Events were considered as related to Covid 19 Vaccine by reporter. Event required a visit to Emergency Room. The clinical course as following: She received her first Covid 19 vaccine yesterday, on 23Mar2021. After she received the Covid 19 vaccine she walked down the hall to wait in the other room. When she sat down in the other room her heart started pounding and racing. The nurse took her pulse and took her blood pressure. The nurse asked her if she had high blood pressure and she does not have high blood pressure, she has low blood pressure. And the nurse told her that her pulse was fast. A second nurse came in to recheck her blood pressure and she got a high reading as well. The nurses called the nurse practitioner in also. The nurse practitioner said the caller should go to the emergency department. Her throat also felt funny but not bad. She has had reactions in the past when her throat got tight. In the emergency department she received 2 Benadryl, 50mg of Benadryl. They checked her out in the emergency department. The doctor checked her out. She was hooked up to monitor and she stayed for 4-5 hours in the emergency department in case there was a rebound effect. She was discharged from the emergency department. She reports her pulse was 118 beats per minute. She felt like it was higher than that. Her blood pressure was 220/118 the first time. She takes her blood pressure at home and it runs 118-120 over 68-72. The sensation after the Covid 19 vaccine was her heart started pounding. Her heart was moving she could see it pounding. She asked the emergency room doctor what does she do about the second Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Apr2021. The doctor told her he wasn&#39;t sure about that. The doctor advised her to call the CDC and let them know what&#39;s going on. She did not speak to anyone at the CDC, she left her contact information for a call back. She found the number for Pfizer and called it. The symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours before the pulse came down to the 90&#39;s (beats per minute). The blood pressure came down quicker then the pulse did. Probably within the hour her blood pressure was down to 158 over something. In the emergency department she was instructed to take Benadryl 25mg every 6 hours for 24-48 hours. She&#39;s not back to her perky self, but her heart rate and blood pressure is normal. She took 25mg of Benadryl last night, 23Mar2021 then 25mg of Benadryl this morning, 24Mar2021. She&#39;s not taking it right at every 6 hours. And she&#39;ll take the Benadryl for only 24 hours. She reports it&#39;s unnerving for this to happen to her. It helped her that her blood pressure was coming down and they didn&#39;t have to give her any other medication besides the Benadryl. She felt like she was in a safe place in the emergency department. She kept drinking water the whole time, she likes to drink a lot of water and she also did some deep breathing exercises. She gets anxious when things like this happen to her. She felt this was medically significant because she didn&#39;t know what caused it. Is something in the vaccine that might have caused this to happen. When probing for relevant tests, she reports she had no tests done in the emergency department. They only maintained her on a heart rate monitor and took her blood pressure. She had no IV or anything like that. All the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction was described as high blood pressure, heart was racing, throat felt funny. Time of onset was minutes after receiving the vaccine, symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours. Patient require medical intervention included Antihistamine, Benadryl 50mg. Patient seen in the Emergency Department, she was monitored in the emergency department for about 4-5 hours on a heart rate monitor and had her blood pressure taken. The patient was not hospitalized. Organ involvement Cardiovascular: Hypertension 220/118, Tachycardia 118 beats per minute. The event was not required the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Patient&#39;s outcome following the potential anaphylactic reaction was Recovering. No laboratory tests or diagnostic studies performed. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. The patient hasn&#39;t received any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported anaphylactic reaction described as high blood pressure, palpitation and oropharyngeal discomfort was likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 71-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 10Apr2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS), tamsulosin, and iron. The patient got her first injection on Saturday, 10Apr2021 at 1:30 pm in the afternoon around 7 o&#39;clock the same day she started to itch, it was mild across her breast and stomach but her thighs and bottom legs were turning red, swelling, hives there too, and she rubbed alcohol (treatment) on this to stop the itch, that seems to helped a little bit, but the swelling was not that bad today but the redness was still there. She has scabs on her, blood was coming through, and slight bee stings all over and thigh on an unspecified date, she used hydrocortisone cream (treatment), she was lucky she have some of that here because she keep that when going or here but she rubbed that on last night and that was the only way that she was able to get some sleep. The patient doesn&#39;t think that she was going to get the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to experience that again. It feels like that today it was not that bad itching today but at 71 that was miserable yesterday so probably she would not get the second shot. She hopes that the first one can protect her to a point, but she cannot subject herself to that again, that would be senseless for her to experience that again and get a second shot. The patient also stated that her eyelids have been a little itchy too so hopefully you all understand it was 71 years old was suffering from that kind of misery second time. The patient was unable to probe the more question, patient was in pain and not willing to proceed. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                1st covid shot on 1/16/21.  Then on 1/19/21 I had ortho inject a steroid in my thumb.  Right after the steroid shot, I started reactions---Severe headache, chills, nausea, cough, upper chest pain, severe weakness, blood pressure up and down.  Went to family doctor 1/22 and covid shot in office showed negative.  Worse on 1/24/21 and went to ED.  They did a chest x-ray, CTA chest, lots of bloodwork and covid test that took 2 hours to receive results.  All was negative except the D-dimer test.  Thye thought it might be a result of the 2 injections within days of each other.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 at a single dose in the hospital for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety, seizures, and high cholesterol. She passed out last summer and they put her in the hospital from 31Aug2020 and ran all kinds of tests. In the end, they said she only had a few PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and she doesn&#39;t need to see the doctor for a year. Mentioned she also has chronic bronchitis and this is related to having low platelet count and low immunity. All of these events predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin for high cholesterol, clonazepam for seizures, escitalopram for anxiety, levothyroxine sodium for thyroid, and mirtazapine for sleep; all were ongoing. Stated that she had something weird happen after her injection about four hours after the shot. She received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 in the right arm. About three or four hours later on 13Jan2021, she was getting ready for bed and when she sat down and leaned over she had a god awful burning in her chest and nausea. She was going to take baking soda but when she sat up she had horrible pressure and pain in her chest and felt woozy so she sat on the floor and then the pain started to radiate through her arm and into her neck. The horrible pain and pressure in her chest felt like something was sitting on her chest and the bad pain in her chest was going into her arm and a little into her neck. She laid real still on the floor, and did a lot of praying, and then 20 minutes later it totally stopped. She got up slowly and finished getting ready for bed and was fine. She was just hoping they will still let her get the second shot. The whole event only lasted 20 minutes and when it was over it was completely gone. She did tell her husband when he came home. She was alone when this happened. The patient wanted to know if she can receive second dose of vaccine. She stated it almost felt like a heart attack. She was planning to get the second dose on 03Feb2021. Wanted to know if her effect will preclude her from getting the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 14-JAN-2021 at the 72 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included COPD so sometimes she would cough, kidney stent, rheumatoid (&#34;two&#34; Tylenol and 20 mg prednisone for &#34;her rheumatoid&#34;). The concomitant medication was clarithromycin (MACROBID) from an unspecified date to 12Jan2021. The patient got it on the 14Jan2021. She says she had been doing fine she didn&#39;t know now. She was a retired paramedic so she usually felt things out, she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching on 14Jan2021 but she did not think anything of it. Friday evening she had a good time eating some walnuts and she woke up about 2:30 itching that was Saturday morning before day, she took Benadryl and went back to sleep later then later on she was itching a little again in the palm of her hands and she just took a Benadryl and it went away. Then Sunday night, last night, she was okay so she decided to go to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl, they had no Benadryl and she only had old Benadry. Then about 12:30 she started itching on her bottom, itching on her arms and she was scratching. She noticed she was having some face soreness in Jan2021 but she was using some expired facial cream so she thought that was why her face was sore so she put some hydrocortisone cream on it. Since she was itching she decided to take a little of her nieces Benadryl, it is pediatric Benadryl. She was itching so she called her doctor and she heard him in the ER say they had too many people in there to tell her to go to the ER so she said okay. She hung up and called the pharmacy and they said it sounds like having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she told him she had the COVID vaccine but she doesn&#39;t think she was short of breath and she gave them her vitals her BP was 152/85(BP 157/85) that was high for her in Jan2021, but it came down, she took some Tylenol then it was 146/77, her pulse rate was 77 and her respirations were good she did not have shortness of breath or cough well she has COPD so sometimes she would cough. Then she got up and said let me go one over and get some Benadryl so she went by there got some good Benadryl and she thought she would call and see what they think about all this. She took the Benadryl at 10:25 and she is doing okay right now but she had whelps, she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching in Jan2021, it is on the left side of her hip, the cellulitis part of her skin that is mostly where she is itching in Jan2021. She remembers when she worked at the health department they would give Benadryl and Prednisone. She thought if the Benadryl does not help then she would call, then she decided she would go ahead and call to see what information they have. She says Pfizer is giving her alerts that she has been answering but she did not have the itching at that time. She retired from being a paramedic in 2009. She says she is 72 now but she woke up in 1985 and her lip was swollen like not totally swollen but her top lip was swollen more than the bottom in Jan2021. They gave her an Epinephrine shot and Benadryl and she is just wondering if this itching is related to the vaccine or if it is just an allergy that she may have come up on or something like to the walnuts or something. She says they went there and they gave the shot and they gave Benadryl but they are not sure. She said the doctor never figured our what it was that cause it and it never happened again until she did notice a little puffiness on her lip again this morning. She said the itching first started around 2:34 AM in the morning before light. It had improved since taking up to date Benadryl. She was supposed to get her second dose 04Feb2021. She didn&#39;t want COVID 19. She knew she just came off, she had a kidney stent and she had stopped taking 2 days before, she was taking Macrobid. She was not taking that right now. She took a lot of other medications but the Macrobid she was just on and it was stopped on Tuesday 12Jan2021, 2 days before the vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if the Macrobid would interfere with getting vaccine. The outcome of the event itching was recovering, the other events was unknown.

                                                she has a bleeding disorder/ a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding; Hashimotos&#39; Disease; Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease; allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes; allergies to adhesive, and polymers; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer based on information received by Pfizer from Bristol-Myers Squibb (Manufacturer Control Number US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-005628), license party for apixaban (ELIQUIS).   This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: 2021040024) on 18Jan2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 19Jan2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (Hashimotos&#39; Disease), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease) and HAEMORRHAGE (she has a bleeding disorder/ a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding) in 72-year-old female patient who received apixaban (ELIQUIS) for an unknown indication. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included COVID-19 VACCINE for an unknown indication. On an unknown date, the patient started ELIQUIS (unknown route) and COVID-19 VACCINE (Intramuscular). On an unknown date, the patient experienced AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (seriousness criterion medically significant), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (seriousness criterion medically significant), HAEMORRHAGE (seriousness criterion medically significant), CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY (allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes) and DERMATITIS CONTACT (allergies to adhesive, and polymers). The action taken with ELIQUIS (Unknown) was unknown. At the time of the report, AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS, MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, HAEMORRHAGE, CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY and DERMATITIS CONTACT outcome was unknown. Consumer reported that she had read the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and have some questions to the &#34;What should you mention to your vaccination provider&#34;. Caller mentioned that she has allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes, adhesive, and polymers such as the angio-seal that was used on her for a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding. She has irritation from the polymer and described it as a sponge that was meant to be absorbed for a month. Her first question was does the COVID-19 vaccine contain latex, mold (polymers) and adhesive? Response: For latex. For mold (polymer) and adhesive: &#34;A review of the ingredients list on the product label show that mold (polymer) and adhesive are not part of the formulation, however, Pfizer does not specifically manufacture the vaccine to be free of mold (polymer) and adhesive, therefore, we cannot assure that it was &#34;mold (polymer)-free and adhesive free&#34;. We cannot guarantee that minute amounts of substances are not contained in raw materials obtained from our suppliers. She had the PPSD23/Pneumonia 23 vaccine last 05Jan2021 and was told not to get the COVID-19 vaccine for 14 days. Is it because of the injection site or is it for systemic reasons? Consumer mentioned that she was on ELIQUIS. She has Hashimoto&#39;s Disease and Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease. She said that she was not immunocompromised. She mentioned that she has a bleeding disorder. The Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine can only be administered as an intramuscular injection For ELIQUIS (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Reporter&#39;s causality assessment was not provided.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Causality assessment for ELIQUIS: Events: Hashimoto&#39;s disease, Contrast media allergy, Topical adhesive allergy, Mixed connective tissue disease were considered unrelated while bleeding was considered related.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: BMS Medical Evaluation Comment: This patient had autoimmune thyroiditis, mixed connective tissue disease and hemorrhage after receiving apixaban therapy. This patient also had COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the anticoagulant action of apixaban, its role in the event hemorrhage is considered as possible. Based on the etiology of the reported events, auto immune thyroiditis and mixed connective tissue disorder are considered not related to apixaban.

A 72-year-old female received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 28Jan2021, 11:00 AM (lot number:EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient medical condition included right Bundle Branch Block, cardiac from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no known allergies. The patient concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and Upgraid. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in the left arm on 06Jan2021, 02:00PM (lot number: EL3249) at the age of 72 years for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested after the vaccination for covid-19. Twenty-four hours after vaccine received, on 29Jan2021 at 03:00 PM, the patient suddenly lost ability to speak intelligibly. The patient stated &#34;I was completely aware though a little &#34;foggy&#34;. Blood pressure 170/84. Friend present thought I was having a TIA and called 911. Ambulance came.  Within 25 minutes, my ability to speak returned slowly. By the time I got to the ER, (45 minutes after onset), my ability to speak had mostly returned.&#34; Many blood labs were drawn, CT of head done, MRI of head done. EKG done. No cause of incident or evidence of TIA seen. After 5 hours, the patient was discharged with orders to come back if symptoms reoccurred. The patient had a headache, scratchy throat, fatigue and body aches in 2021. Since then the patient had a variety of tests, labs and Dr. visits. Blood pressure has been higher than her normal of 120/80, at intervals during the day in 2021. Since no evidence of TIA has been found, the patient was wondering if there have been any other reports of this loss of speaking ability (aphasia) occurring with any other vaccine recipients. The patient received treatment for the events. The consumer considered the events as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On 2/2/21 I developed chest pressure and irregular heart beat at 4:00 pm.  Went to ER and it spontaneously resolved while staff was telling me how they would treat it.  Gave me Metoprolol 5 mg IV with 500 IV fluids and discharged.  Then on 2/6/21 I slept poorly and felt very jittery and had more chest pressure but pulse was regular.  then on 2/8/21 at 6:00 am I awoke and felt terrible with chest pressure.  Took my blood pressure at home and it was  193/103, and I was very shaky.  Went to  ER where they did blood work, X-ray, and monitored my heart and blood pressure for 4 hrs.  Gradually my blood pressure came down, and my blood work and X-ray probed to be WNL.  I was discharged without medication change but had echocardiogram scheduled and follow-up  appt. with Cardiologist, on  zoom.  He started me on Flecainide 100 mg bid, and stress test on  2/24/21 and follow-up appt. with him on 3/3/21.  I also had a follow-up appt. with my GP the day after the first ER visit and she ordered more labs, and the echocardiogram.  I have continued to have feelings of fluttering and pressure in my chest off and on and they continued after my second vaccine.  But my heart has remained regular since starting the Flecainide.  But my blood pressure went up to 150/85 on 2/9/21 and again to 142/81 on 2/10/21 both times with feelings of jitteriness and pressure in my chest.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9262, expiration date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at left upper arm around 19:00 or a little later at single dose (at the age of 72-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included bad knees and got injections for this and recurrent cellulitis of legs (cellulitis was not active at time of vaccine; but anytime her leg swells with bad knees she had a little episode with the cellulitis down around her ankles on both legs but left leg was more predominant. She had been keeping it at bay), mineral supplementation, bad knee pain, blood pressure medication (abnormal), urine output control (abnormal), dehydrated and dizzy. Concomitant medication included lisinopril as blood pressure medication, potassium for Mineral supplement, solifenacin succinate for urine output control, paracetamol (TYLENOL 4) for bad knee pain. She had taken potassium before and it calmed it down: she was little dehydrated, little dizzy, so was drinking some Pedialyte, water, and taking potassium. The patient had it once before but it kind of snuck up on her again. The patient called to ask if anyone had reported any type of blood clot on the same side of the body that the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. She questioned if she might have a blood clot in her left leg after having been administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She had recurrent cellulitis in both legs prior to Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The doctor thought the cellulitis in left leg may be acting up and that she might have an infection in that area of cellulitis. She reported pain in the left leg when she rested her leg on a pillow; but did not feel any pain when she was standing and walking. The pain became a little too hard for her to bear so the doctor prescribed her Cephalexin 500m capsule every 12 hours-she was on the 3rd capsule now. Onset date for the events was approximately 03Feb2021 or 04Feb2021. The events were better since started Cephalexin. Second dose date scheduled for 22Feb2021 but did not give her time. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Follow-up (23Feb2021): New information received from the product quality complaint group includes confirmation of lot number (EL9262) and new expiry date.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 72-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206) at left arm on 08Mar2021 09:30 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteoarthritis, nodules on thyroids and allergy to Aspartsme. No covid tested post vaccination. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication included pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PANTOPRAZOLE 40). the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient previously took Sulfanomide (Sulfa drugs) and had allergy (swelling), codeine and had allergy (nausea). The symptom that has made patient concerned enough to report the possibility of a side effect is: she had her shot this morning and between about 8:55 and 9:15 this evening she had 9 or 10 episodes of what feels like her heart quivering for several seconds followed 3 or 4 times by very slight pain, just below her right breast, she has never experienced such a thing before. (she took baby aspirin around 9:20 in case she was having some kind of heart thing). It&#39;s 9:45 pm, and the quivering episodes haven&#39;t happened for the last 30 minutes, so maybe they&#39;re all cleared up. Earlier, within 30 min of getting the vaccine, her ears started feeling like they were stopped up and her nose started feeling stuffy. Then as she was driving home she felt flushed and looked in the mirror and her face was red, she took one Sudafed in case it was allergies, and those symptoms improved quite a lot. Adverse event start date was 08Mar2021 10:00 AM. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Unknown if treatment received for ears started feeling like they were stopped up and nose started feeling stuffy. Outcome of what feels like my heart quivering for several seconds followed 3 or 4 times by very slight pain was recovered. Outcome of felt flushed and face was red was recovering and outcome of other events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

All blood tests do not show that it came from a DVT or or that it was inherited therefore, can not show where the clot came from. It is unknown or considered &#34;Unprovoked&#34; due to unknown cause. This causes a concern for an adverse reaction from the vaccine

                                                the problem was a bloodclot; slight swelling of right foot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 72-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure and allergy to tape. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; olmesartan; metformin; all were taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to BNT162b2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 13Mar2021 15:00, the patient noticed slight swelling of right foot and on 14Mar2021, the swelling increased so the patient texted the nurse who arranged appointment. The nurse said to contact the doctor and the patient spoke with registered nurse (RN) on duty who told the patient to go to the emergency room (ER) because the symptoms indicated the problem was a blood clot. The ER doctor examined and ordered an ultrasound and the results confirmed blood clot. The patient was given a prescription for blood thinner to take for 21 days (times/day, 15mg) and was told to make an appointment with the primary doctor. The patient&#39;s doctor was on spring break and she was walked in to see another doctor who said swelling looked improved and showed her where the clots were located. The patient saw her primary doctor today and she ordered a visit with a hematologist as soon as possible (ASAP) because of concerns about possible underlying issues. The outcome of events, slight swelling of right foot and the problem was a blood clot was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

The patient has been diagnosed with AML back in 2016 and underwent several lines of therapy including chemotherapy with 7 and 3 and the last treatment was decitabine with maintenance treatment with ivosidenib.  Having severe leukocytosis and right-sided leg edema with DVT raised concern about  blast crisis and leukostasis. Patient was admitted to hospital and received. ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible pneumonia.  She underwent leukophoresis on the 4/6/2021, 4/7/2021. Patient received IV heparin gtt for DVT but later on was on hold given worsening thrombocytopenia. She was transferred from one hospital to another hospital.  I do not think the development of DVT was due to COVID vaccine. But prior to COVID vaccine, patient was in AML remission.

                                                congestion in her chest; The congestion in her chest is, she knows it&#39;s there, it&#39;s tight,; cough; arm was sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reporting for herself. This is report 1 of 2. A 72-year-old consumer (female) received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL9266, Expiry date: May2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 25-FEB-2021 at left arm around 11:30 -12:30 and patient received second dose BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: ER8730/GR8730) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 both as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medication reported as diabetes and blood pressure medicine (From: Unspecified To: Ongoing), has since about 2015 or 2013 or something like that. She declines to provide her medication. She is not a serious diabetic. Sometimes she does not have to even take the diabetes medication because she keeps her A1C is so low she doesn&#39;t have to take the diabetes shots. She did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. She didn&#39;t have any other real problems with the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine other than her arm getting sore. For her second Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine she don&#39;t have to bother her arm. She had a little cough started sometime last week before she took the second Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The cough doesn&#39;t happen all the time. She was coughing quite regular every 2-3 minutes before. She got the Diabetic Tussin cough syrup which has no sugar or alcohol. After taking that cough started quieting down. She was asking is it a regular cough or did the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine cause the cough. She&#39;s taking it once a day sometimes twice a day. It is nasty cause it&#39;s got nothing in it. Maybe she is not taking it enough, it says to take it every 4 hours, maybe she is not taking it enough, she does not know. She is taking it maybe once or twice daily, maybe she takes it more. She reports it&#39;s not a constant cough. She also has some congestion in her chest. The congestion in her chest it&#39;s tight, she just knows it&#39;s there. Her chest congestion is staying about the same. If she gets rid of the cough, she&#39;ll get rid of the chest congestion she guesses. Caller reported that people are not educating themselves on these shots, referring to the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shots. They&#39;ll tell you it&#39;s gone kill you; that she does not believe because some people have died, they took the shot and they didn&#39;t get a chance to take the second shot and they passed away. And they are telling her not to get the vaccine because it&#39;s going to hurt her. She&#39;s going to put it in God&#39;s hands and take that Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine to help prevent or at least have it in her system. She&#39;s 72 years old and concerned about herself. The outcome of the event arm sore is unknown, little cough with outcome recovering, congestion in her chest outcome not recovered.

A 72-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/Lot Number: ER2613), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 13:53 (at 72-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Spinal leak (Diagnosed with a spinal leak about 1-1/2 years ago. She said she has had spinal leaks, on and off, since that time.), ongoing Oral lichen planus (Stated she was diagnosed with Oral Lichen Planus between 10-15 years ago), ongoing Rheumatoid arthritis (Stated she was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at least 3 years before she was diagnosed with Oral Lichen Planus. She said she had been tested for food allergies &amp; as long as she stayed away from gluten, chicken, tomatoes &amp; some other things, she did not have a problem with her rheumatoid arthritis. She said gluten, in particular,  triggered her rheumatoid arthritis.), Gluten (triggered her rheumatoid arthritis), fractured her L4 vertebrae in last summer 2020, sciatica from Feb2020 (pinched sciatic nerve since Feb2020), Bone density issue. Stated her family has a history of autoimmune diseases, like Lupus. Concomitant medications included diphenhydramine, paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL PM, NDC Number: 50580-937-19, Lot Number: SLA006, Expiration Date: Aug2024); ibuprofen (ADVIL, UPC Number: 305730154604, Lot Number: EG1007, Expiration Date: Jul2023); gabapentin (&#34;ACI Health&#34;, Expiration Date of 05Mar2022). The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EN6198) on 02Mar2021 (at 72-years-old) Intramuscular on left arm for covid-19 immunization but experience Left arm was sore, left arm soreness went away after 2-3 days. The patient previously took Flu vaccine but experienced Mouth sores. Reported she had both COVID-19 Vaccine doses. She said she got the typical side effects of a headache, chills, not feeling well, and her body was aching. She clarified those side effects started late the night of her second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (24Mar2021). She said those side effects were mild, and resolved in about 2 days. She said she didn&#39;t think much of those side effects, until the next day (25Mar2021), when the other side effects started (blacked out, lightheaded, equilibrium was off). She said her left arm was sore after her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t treat her left arm soreness, and the left arm soreness went away after 2-3 days. Reported on 25Mar2021 at about 11:30AM, she blacked out. She said she just sat down in a chair, and everything went black for a second. She said she then got really lightheaded, and her equilibrium was off. Reported she had spinal leaks, on and off, for the past 1-1/2 years. She clarified that her doctors didn&#39;t think the spinal cord leaks would be contraindicated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said all her doctors said it was up to her if she wanted to get the COVID-19 Vaccine because she previously had problems with the flu vaccine. She clarified she had a flu vaccine about 15 years ago, and the day after the flu vaccine, she got mouth sores, and the mouth sores got worse. She said her local doctors didn&#39;t know how to treat her mouth sores, so she went to the clinic. She said the clinic doctors told her she had Oral Lichen Planus, and the Oral Lichen Planus was caused by the flu vaccine she had received. She stated she did not have any information (NDC, Lot, &amp; Expiration Date) for the flu vaccine she received back then. She stated she has not had a flu vaccine since that time. Reported her spinal cord leaks caused equilibrium, and lightheadedness. She said she thought her second COVID-19 Vaccine exasperated her spinal cord leak symptoms because her lightheadedness, and equilibrium being off, started on 25Mar2021 11:30. She said her lightheadedness, and equilibrium being off was still going on. Reported she hurt more, too, in her L4 &amp; L5 vertebrae, and had pain throughout her whole body. She clarified she fractured her back (specifically her L4 vertebrae) last summer (2020), and her L4 vertebrae had since healed. She said she had a pinched sciatic nerve since Feb2020. She clarified her L4 and L5 vertebrae move because she had 3 blood patches to treat her spinal cord leaks. She said when the blood patches were done a lot of force was used to stop the spinal leaks. She said the first blood patch caused her buttocks to really hurt. She said she had 2 more blood patches. She said she was not too sure about second blood patch, but with the 3rd blood patch, she was miserable. She said she had physical therapy weekly, and she may have to have her back fused. She said she had a bone density issue that apparently was mentioned in her medical records when she was in her 50s. She said she was never treated for her bone density issue until after she fractured her L4 vertebrae in 2020. No further details provided. Reported her last blood work was 3-4 months ago. No further details provided. Reported her Oral Lichen Planus was more pronounced since her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose (Mar2021). She clarified she started to get Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores a couple days after she received her second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she can go months without having any issues, and then get the Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores. She said she took medication to manage her Oral Lichen Planus.

It was sky high. 210/180 They took it a couple of times and even changed machines.  Then the took me in a wheelchair to the ER. On the way I could not answer some questions  or my answers were slow. According to my husband I slumped a bit. And answered questions in my native tongue. In the room they did all kinds of  tests.  BP was still high, but came down . After a few hours my ?fog? in my head cleared and I felt ? normal ? again.  They let me go around 11 pm. The doctor said it was NOT the vaccine, but I disagree with her. I felt good till I got the shot. She says I had a syncope vasovagal. But that occurs with low BP. I had high BP.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed 15 years ago, maybe; High cholesterol diagnosed 20 years ago, she doesn&#39;t know, reflux diagnosed 20 years ago, maybe more, prediabetes and allergy induced asthma which she carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year. Patient reported that she was tested and they don&#39;t know for sure, but she reported that she may have allergy induced asthma as she has to take, carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year, in the fall when leaves are falling down, the leaves get moldy, and she was driving in her car, or walking in a wooded area, she gets tightness, takes her inhaler and was fine, that&#39;s the extent, no other circumstances; fall or she had where a plant was blooming outdoors, she gets tightness, and she took her inhaler, and was good for the next year, so sitting in the environment and nothing further materializes, if she takes the inhaler three or two times a year, considering what other people have, she thought this was insignificant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she got vaccinated this Friday and had nothing but a sore arm afterwards, on 16Jan2021 and was fine all day, evening, all day Saturday. She just had soreness at the site, she had no redness at the site of injection, but the weird part: she doesn&#39;t think anyone would believe, 33 hours later, at midnight, she was still up, on her way to bed, and all of a sudden she experienced extremely excruciating stabbing pains in her arm with the shot, it was stabbing, excruciating, and immediately at the same time, she had shivers/shivered and had a splitting headache, was freezing and had to put socks on, and had noticed very slight difficulty breathing, and since it was midnight, she didn&#39;t want to wake up her husband, she dozed off, and was up at 0530. She had body aches, slight, it was the least, but the stabbing stopped in her arm. She slept from 12:30 to 05:30, and the shivering and aches stopped, but the headache was still on, so she took a pill for the headache. She took the thermometer that marked 100F orally; she stated that the fever was higher in the night and she assumed with the shivering, she had a greater fever than 100. Also, the oximeter indicated 133 pulse and 86 of oxygen saturation. By 10:00, it all had resolved. She has an oximeter, and since she still had the feeling of difficulty breathing, she put it on, but her pulse was 133, that was when she was feeling better. It was reported that all symptoms were gone except for rapid pulse, it was 133 and the slight breathing, and her 02 saturation was anywhere between 86-88, it varied, and by 10:00, all issues resolved, her heartbeat was down to normal, her breathing was above 94, or whatever, everything was fine, and has been fine since then. Maybe she had fatigue on Saturday and Sunday, on Sunday was like after the flu, after you finish, you have fatigue and was a little out of it, this was on Sunday. On an unspecified date, the patient stated that she was shrinking and weight varies. Patient stated that the only thing she does have, says she has a cough, but because she needs a drink, she was not sick and she gets to drink water. She felt like the reaction she had was in the limit of a severe allergic reaction due to the rapid heartbeat and her difficulty breathing. She would like to know if there was information about these side effects reported so she can determine if she was going to have the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of events states she was shrinking, weight varies and cough was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was recovered on an unspecified date.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283, expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 10:02 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Seasonal Allergies (probably started in the last 4-5 years; reoccurs every year from about Oct through Mar), ongoing high blood pressure since like 2006 or 2004, ongoing Iliac artery stent placed started couple of years ago, anxiety from 2010 and ongoing (her cardiologist put her on Xanax around 2010-ongoing). Concomitant medication included ongoing alprazolam (XANAX) since 2010 for anxiety. She gets the flu shot every year and has never had a problem with the flu shot. She got her last flu shot in Oct2020, no adverse events with that or other flu shots historically. On the second dose of Pneumococcal vaccine, it swelled her arm up from the injection site all the way down to her wrist; she went to the urgent care for that. They gave her some medicine and eventually the adverse event went away. She experienced some side effects following that injection. The patient reported that in the morning of the 20Jan2021, she was weak and just kind of rested. She did not have any other side effects until 21Jan2021. At 5am on 21Jan2021, for the whole day she had a fast heart rate, 125bpm, she woke up with her heart rate up, fast heartbeat, then down to 110 and then just toggled a little bit, she had blurry eyes so she could not really focus her eyes, weakness and dizziness. These events continued all throughout 21Jan2021 but her heart rate came down, it was running in the 90s and she was weak all day. Her blood pressure was also up on 21Jan2021. She thinks the blurry eyes, with her eyes being squirrely was related to her heart rate being up and blood pressure being up. She feels like she recovered completely from these events by this morning 22Jan2021. She feels good, strong and her eyes are clear today, felt better than yesterday but not 100%. She has probably shrunk in height, her last known height was 5&#39; 9. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose as scheduled for 12Feb2021 in response to the side effects. Outcome of the event &#39;she has probably shrunk in height&#39; was unknown while the rest of the events was recovered on 22Jan2021.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Two days after receiving the vaccine,  on Jan 28th, I noticed pain in my right lower back area.  It went away so I didn?t pay much attention to it.  On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

                                                On Feb. 12th at 2PM symptoms started with lower back pain, pain in abdomen and stomach, cramping, chills, ear ache, pain level 8.  Felt sick all over, like having the flu and then whole body ached, not just GI track.  Left arm injection site was red, sore to touch, swollen (slightly).  Doctor couldn&#39;t get vaccination needle into arm muscle the first time and so had to try a second time.   Intense cramping of GI track started up again 8:45AM on Feb. 13th.   By 4PM Feb. 15th fever 102F, chills, felt freezing cold and had to wrap myself in a heating blanket.  Pain level 10, especially in pancreas. Fever broke around 2:30AM Feb. 16th and later when I was up at 8AM I felt very weak, faint, pancreas ached.  Pancreatic pain lasted another 3 days.  Pancreatic pain stayed around level 5.  On Feb. 17th took ibuprophen.  Pain level reduced to 1.   This was the only time that I took pain medication between Feb. 10th and 17th, because I am conservative about using Ibuprophen, Tylenol, and have a high threshold for pain.

                                                Tingling of fingers and numbness of left cheek.  Did not get any worse after 30 minutes. Extremely tired and sore arm that day.  Day 2 - tired easily, no stamina.  Dizzy and nauseous after showering at3:30 pm.  By 10:30, both hands were red and itched.  Sometime in the night woke with a very sharp, painful headache.  Did not last.  No real problem again until Saturday.  Nausea at 11:20 am.  Sunday I sat all day doing taxes - no symptoms noted.  Monday after walking - rapid heart rate and very tired after what is normal activity.  By 4:30 I was tingling all over my body.  Tuesday night my ankles are swollen for the first time in years.  Only happened that nigh.  Wednesday morning, the tingling is very strong in my calves. and I had a sharp pain in the area of my Achilles tendon.  I believe that the vaccine has exacerbated the neuropathy (undiagnosed) of the bottom of my feet.  Today I am reporting because I fell for no reason getting out of a chair, and the tingling is in my legs, arms, shoulders.  I had not heard until today that the vaccine could affect the nervous system.  The effects are the worst they have been and it has been one week since I had the vaccine.  Should I get the second shot?  Due March 11,2021.

                                                irregular heart beat; congestion in the chest; dizzy/the dizziness she was having and feeling now after getting the vaccine was definitely more noticeable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient). A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid/ left upper arm in the shoulder on 26Jan2021 around 14:00 (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: stroke about 4-5 years ago in June, dizziness, blood pressure. The patient also had difficulty writing stuff down; besides having a number issue, she had issues writing numbers down. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from an unspecified date and ongoing as a blood thinner. The patient stated she was on ten different medications. These medications were added after the stroke. Before the stroke she was not on any medication. The patient did not have any vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient got the pneumonia vaccine (unspecified), but thinks it was longer than 4 weeks before. She did not remember, but she believed it had been a month and a half to 2 months (at the age of 73-years-old) since getting the pneumonia vaccine for immunization. The patient had the COVID shot on Tuesday of this week (26Jan2021), and she didn&#39;t seem to have much of a reaction other than what they expected except at 21:00 that night, she got pretty dizzy. She was still dizzy now. It was enough for her to have to walk with a cane in order to try and keep herself leveled. She could not move quickly. She did not know why she had this reaction. She called her doctor the next day, and he did not understand why. She mentioned she was reading material and saw this could be a severe side effect/situation. The doctor mentioned they were trying to find out if it was related to the blood pressure. She wanted to know if this is part of the side effect, dizziness? When the patient was attempting to provide the zip code, she stated her mind was going blank and could not remember the zip code. She later found something with it written on it and provided those details.  She explained she had a stroke when trying to provide her current age. She stated numbers are hard for her. She stated she would be 74 in March, and questioned how old that would make her now, she later confirmed as 73. She read information today about the COVID vaccine, and she saw that one should be cautious about the vaccine if have a bleeding disorder, and she commented she was on a blood thinner. She went to the doctor last week and mentioned she was having dizziness. She clarified she had dizziness before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. When she went to the doctor, they thought it was due to blood pressure as the problem. They changed her blood pressure medication by placing on a higher dose. Then she started having more dizziness, and the dose was taken back down to the dose she was on before. She also added, she has an irregular heartbeat (unspecified date). She went to the doctor because of congestion in the chest (unspecified date); that was why she went to the doctor. The doctor asked about dizziness and she said she was having a little. However, the dizziness she was having and feeling now after getting the vaccine was definitely more noticeable. The clinical outcome of dizzy was recovering (as reported). The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 EUA Vaccine  Pt received first COVID vaccine 2/25/21. Tested positive for COVID late February. Reported to ED 3/5/21 with near syncope. Patient was seen emergency department laying in bed. The patient had a noticeable scalp laceration to posterior parietal area.  After being symptomatic with COVID-19 for a few days, the patient reports getting up at 5:00 a.m. to use the bathroom, feeling lightheaded, then ended up on the floor, she reports sitting on the floor and then hit her head at some point, but was not entirely sure of this timeline.  She states she ended up moving to the living room when she noticed that her head was bleeding a lot and her fiance called 911. She reports a history of syncopal episode in 2001 when she had influenza and apparently the story was much the same as this time, but she actually lost consciousness in 2001. Admitted to observation.    3/7: 73-year-old female recent COVID-19 infection admitted on 03/05/2021 for an episode of syncope probably secondary to bradycardia versus volume depletion.  Paramedic on arrival at home reported bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s but has been normal since admission. The CT angiogram of the chest done at the emergency room showed bilateral infiltrates compatible with recent COVID-19 infection.  No PE.  However patient has no respiratory symptoms and O2 saturation is perfectly normal.  Urinalysis was suggestive of infection and subsequent culture was positive for E coli and it is pansensitive.    She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  She was commenced on IV Rocephin and azithromycin.  The EP cardiologist was consulted and she recommended and echocardiogram and it revealed mild global hypokinesis with LVEF of 45-50% but patient denied any prior history of cardiac problem.   On re-evaluation this morning the vital signs remains normal.  Patient has not had any episode of bradycardia since she presented to the emergency room.  She will be discharged home follow up with the EP cardiologist for further evaluation. Patient does not need outpatient oral antibiotics as IV Rocephin for 3 days should be adequate for uncomplicated UTI.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6207, expiry date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 10:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes from Jun2001 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included metformin taken for diabetes from Jun2001 and ongoing. The patient previously received flu shot from immunization (she had the flu shot 20 years ago had bad reaction to). Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the hospital. The vaccine was not administered at military facility. The patient received the vaccine on 19Mar2021 and she felt fine that Friday. On 20Mar2021 (Saturday), she started having a bad headache and took Aleve. She took Aleve 3 times 4 hours apart because she still had a bad headache. She started losing the ability to bring out words. She stated that her headache was gone. On 21Mar2021 (around 4 o clock), her husband was in the kitchen and asked her a question but could not understand her and asked again. She could not say the words but she could spell them. Her husband asked her another question, she tried to talk but she could not answer back. At that point her husband said they were going to the hospital. She was admitted for 3 days from 21Mar2021 to 23Mar2021. The doctor told her she was having a migraine because it had lasted for 2 days. She also spoke with her primary care provider, who looked it up and said this could be a side effect. She was told the migraine may take away the ability to talk. Her headache has been gone but continues to feel very tired (extremely tired since 19Mar2021). Her symptoms came out as if she was having a stroke on an unspecified date. The event &#39;could not understand words but could not answer back&#39; required an emergency room visit.The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CAT scan, MRI, and contrast test, all with negative result on 22Mar2021. The outcome of the event &#39;could understand words but could not answer back&#39; was recovered on 22Mar2021, the event &#39;bad headache/migraine&#39; was recovered on 21Mar2021, not recovered for extremely tired, and unknown for the event &#39;stroke&#39;.

She underwent R foot debridement and amputation on 4/16/2021. ID team treated with Vanco/Cefepime. On 4/18 afternoon, she developed PEA and coded for about 25min. Since ROSC, she never regained consciousness. This morning, at the beginning of my shift at 7am, she&#39;s on bicarb drip, maxed Levophed 100, Epi 100 drips and full vent. However, she was getting paced and BP stayed in 40s. I discussed with ICU pharmacist and gave her stress dose Solu-cortef. Checked serum cortisol level, turned out to be appropriate later. Lactic acid 22 and bicarb was only 2 despite being on Bicarb drip. I called Shauna/daughter to  inform her about guarded prognosis (imminent death) and asked to bring husband to come see her asap. Before family arrived, she developed another PEA and code blue was called. She was given Epi, bicarb pushes and CPR started immediately. Code blue was unsuccessful. At 8:13am, she was pronounced dead. I called daughter again to notify her of patient&#39;s death. Family arrived around 10am. I met both daughter and husband at bedside and offered emotional support. Chaplain was consulted.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 25Mar2021, she received the first COVID-19 vaccine and instantly had a pounding headache.  She went to her doctor who said her blood pressure was elevated and was going to do more testing. She and her sister went away thinking she just needed to relax but then had a stroke in the hotel that same day and was in the hospital for 3 days (until 28Mar2021). She has never had high blood pressure and no history of headaches.  The doctor in the hospital thought that this could be related to the vaccine since she had no high blood pressure or headaches before.  She asked the doctors if she should get the second one and they all said they don&#39;t know enough about the vaccine to give her guidance. Outcome of the events were unknown.   Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

A 73-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7533), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 07Apr2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included breast cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2 on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 73-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced Sore arm and feeling blah. Clinical course was as follows: She spent 50 years in neurology and neuroscience, she was a crazy RN that did neurology right out of school, she was recommended for that specialty. She is not sure if she had a reaction to the vaccine or if it is just her. Her 2nd dose was last Wednesday, 07Apr2021. She had a sore arm and felt blah. Just like after the 1st shot. On Saturday night (10Apr2021) at 0200, she was awakened with chills, cold sweat, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She was sick as a dog for 2 days and didn&#39;t eat or drink much of anything. She went to the doctor who sent her to an infusion center. She is down to 5&#39; 2&#34; and weighed too much. She has not been able to lose weight for a couple years. She gained 40 pounds when she turned 50 years old. After the shot, she had a sore arm and felt blah like she did after the first dose, but she thought everyone felt that way. She missed a day of gym class because of her really sore arm. This got better like after a flu shot, it was nothing. This time she had a really sore arm and felt blah after the shot but then on Saturday morning this whole thing started happening. She woke up very restless, was all sweaty, cold, dizzy and was too miserable to try and take her blood pressure. Her blood pressure tends to run low. Her symptoms of the sore arm resolved at 06:00 Saturday (08Apr2021). She had nausea and vomiting and couldn&#39;t eat or drink. That lasted through Monday morning. She had some back pain with this, but she has back pain normally as she is a little old lady. She had a scheduled Oncology appointment Monday, as did her husband. She experienced orthostatic dizziness. She woke up plain dizzy. Her doctor gave her a liter of fluids and it helped her. This was something that needed to be addressed. It was serious. It was all serious. She had nothing left to vomit. She is an old lady with Breast Cancer. Her creatinine level of 1.10 which dropped her GFR of 52, she calculated the GFR using a computer program. This is what lead to the doctor giving her a liter of fluid. She had an appointment scheduled and her doctor sent her to the infusion centers for a liter of D5NS. She was sent home afterwards and encouraged to drink fluids. She also had a CBC and chemistry panel with her blood work. She was worried because her skin was tenting badly, and she couldn&#39;t keep anything down. She was probably dehydrated. Her blood pressure at the doctor&#39;s office was 82/50. She didn&#39;t care that her skin was tenting. She has been drinking a lot of fluids as advised after her liter of fluids at the infusion center. She is interested in researching the MRNA process because it is used it in other things. The way the vaccine was developed, it should have dissipated after 48 hours. She likes to research everything. She and her husband experienced a year from Hell starting in August of last year. All events are considered serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatinine: 1.10 and blood pressure measurement: 82/50 on 12Apr2021, blood test, full blood count and investigation with unknown results and glomerular filtration rate: 52 on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events chills and cold sweat was recovered on 12Apr2021, skin tenting and orthostatic dizziness was recovered on 13Apr2021, vomiting and nausea was recovered on 14Apr2021, pain in arm was recovered on 10Apr2021, feeling abnormal was recovered on an unspecified date, while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a temporal association and the known drug safety profile, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccine (because she&#39;s 74 and high risk). Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included irbesartan oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date (maybe 3 years ago) and ongoing at 300 mg once daily (150mg, 2 tablets once a day in the morning) for hypertension as blood pressure medication. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on Monday (11Jan2021) morning (AM) at 10 at the county (public) health department. She had no problem at all until yesterday Tuesday, she experienced mild swelling; the swelling happened in the upper left arm (swelling of left arm) which started on 12Jan2021, this was also the same side that she got her vaccine on, the left arm. On 13Jan2021 she woke up at 4AM [also reported as thirty (30) hours after the shot] in which she started to have severe chills (horrendous chills), could not get warm under the blanket for an hour and a half. It lasted a long time. Her severe chills did stop, she used an electric (heated) blanket. This morning on 13Jan2021 at 8:30, she woke up with the fever, which she was able to reduce with acetaminophen (did take two acetaminophen). Her fever was also gone. She was a little concerned because she thought her breathing was deep too on 13Jan2021. She did some relaxing breathing which helped. It lasted a long time. The patient also experienced a drop in blood pressure on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running the past few days at 133/80 on 11Jan2021. Today (13Jan2021), she took her blood pressure and it was at 93/50. It went to 87/56 after drinking some salty soup on 13Jan2021 (the bottom number in the blood pressure was going up a little, and the top number was going down a little). Her blood pressure has been normal 133/70 on Jan2021, but this morning it was 90/50 on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running normal the last couple of days like 133/90 on Jan2021. She was shocked it was lower. She knew they talk about dizziness and weakness, but she didn&#39;t experience that. She was concerned about that sudden drop in blood pressure. She did some research and started eating some salty soup and stuff (has been drinking salty soup). Her bottom number went up to 53 on Jan2021. She was concerned about that drop there. She was wondering if that was a side effect of the vaccine (result of the vaccine). She asked if drop in blood pressure was a concern. She had no positive test for Covid before the vaccine. She never had any tested, she&#39;s been pretty isolated. She had no antibody test. She has had no issues with vaccine in the past. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe chills/could not get warm, fever, her breathing was deep, and drop in blood pressure. The outcome of swelling of left arm/mild swelling and drop in blood pressure was not recovered; of severe chills/could not get warm was recovered on 13Jan2021 05:30 and fever was recovered on 13Jan2021; and of her breathing was deep was recovering.

However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

Then, she was admitted into the hospital with a kidney infection and she has progressively declined. She has no idea if it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine or not. She initially called regarding the second COVID-19 vaccine. She didn&#39;t know what would happen if her mother didn&#39;t show up for her second vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if she would get on the &#34;never going to get the vaccine&#34; list or what as her mother was just so unstable. On an unspecified date, her blood pressure was so low right now they can&#39;t even transfer her to the hospital that can perform the surgery she needs. The reporter stated that she has no idea if this was COVID related or what. She began having problems less than a week later after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, she mentioned Wednesday. On 27Jan2021, her mother began having issues with her kidneys and has progressively declined since. Consumer stated her mother was swollen from head to toe with edema on an unspecified date and that was how this all kind of started. Her mother became very weak and didn&#39;t tell anyone. She fell using her walker on Wednesday and the EMS was called. Her mother told the EMS she wasn&#39;t hurt but was just too weak to get up and EMS got her up.  Her primary care doctor sent her for an x-ray, and she had some wheezing in her chest. She was given an antibiotic for that. The patient fell again, and the EMS was called and had some face lacerations and stuff, so she was taken to the hospital. Consumer confirmed her mother was admitted into the hospital and was first diagnosed with a kidney infection and it has progressively gotten worse. Outcome of event kidney infection was not recovered; and outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Blood pressure feels really high; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID-19 virus in the past year (2020) from which her husband died last year (2020), receiving occupation therapy (OT) at home, and stroke (in the past). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine dose on 16Jan2021 and is scheduled to receive her next COVID-19 vaccine booster on 06Feb2021. The last time the patient had her COVID-19 virus antibody blood work was on 11Jan2021, and her COVID-19 virus antibodies were down to 1.9 from 8 (on an unspecified date). The patient&#39;s COVID-19 virus antibodies have been progressively going down since she was first being tested for them. The patient received a call today that her occupational therapist tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Both her occupational therapist and she were wearing masks when working together. The patient received the call today because she was exposed to the occupational therapist. The patient asked if she can still take the COVID-19 vaccine booster that she is scheduled for on Saturday (06Feb2021). The patient really wanted to get the COVID-19 vaccine booster on 06Feb2021. The patient was going to be speaking with a trained healthcare professional when she is transferred to Pfizer medical information. Anyone the patient has spoken to about getting her second COVID-19 vaccine has not been willing to answer her questions. The patient&#39;s blood pressure feels really high now (02Feb2021), and she has had a stroke in the past. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

The patient&#39;s medical history included hypothryroidism from an unknown date. Patient&#39;s height used to be five foot three with weight: between 140 to 150 pounds, usually around 145 pounds. Concomitant medications included Magnesium Malate at 1000mg and at 200mg (lot number: X002OISTE1 and expiration date: Aug2023). She got Magnesium the heart doctor told her to get. She stopped taking it on 22Jan2021, two days after the first episode on the 20Jan2021. Patient previously had problems with another thyroid drug, it was a natural thyroid medication called NP THYROID and she had palpitations on that one. The drug was not as standardized because it is natural thyroid. She started it in 2019 and took for a year and half. She was on a higher dose, 30mg originally and dropped down to 15mg or .25gram because it was &#34;too much.&#34; The pharmacy sent a notice out that a dosage was too high in May or Jun. Then in Sep the dosage was too low. She asked pharmacy about the lot number and they said they didn&#39;t put it on there. She got it from (Pharmacy name withheld). RX number: 1677890-07298. Manufacturer: (Company name withheld). The dose amount had dropped, and she wasn&#39;t getting enough of the drug and her TSH had gone very high. That was causing the palpitations. Then she was switched to levothyroxine sodium.  On 20Jan2021, patient experienced heart palpitations. It was reported that at the beginning of Jan2021 (also reported as 20Jan2021), patient decided on her own to take levothyroxine sodium sublingually and she experienced heart palpitations. Patient confirmed that this was not prescribed to be taken sublingually. Patient asked if taking levothyroxine sodium sublingually increase its potency. Also, on 20Jan2021, she received the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine. Her thyroid levels taken this past Friday (29Jan2021) were normal. Patient asked if taking the Covid vaccine with levothyroxine sodium cause palpitations. She wanted to know if there is data on taking levothyroxine sodium sublingually. She wanted to know if it has more of an effect and wondered if taking levothyroxine sodium sublingually might have effected it. She doubts if Pfizer has studied it sublingually, but would that have increased the potency of the levothyroxine sodium? Maybe she got more than she was getting before. On 20Jan2021 she received Pfizer&#39;s COVID19 Vaccine. She started having palpitations that night and she was not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with it. The palpitations are ongoing. Some days they get worse and other days they are ok. She thought she was low on levothyroxine sodium, so she started taking a little more. She knew she was supposed to call the doctor.  The day after she got palpitations, she started increasing the thyroid medication and it didn&#39;t seem to help. Over- the- counter Zinc, Magnesium, and Potassium helped. Zinc seemed to have most effect at trying to reduce them. It was reported that patient took Zinc 30 Orotate (lot number: 210606, expiration date: Nov2020). She took it on three occasions when she had it bad. Within a few hours after she took it the palpitations calmed down. Patient also took Potassium (lot number: 8BO3217 and expiration: Mar2003). She has only taken it twice since the palpitations.  She doesn&#39;t take those normally except for the Magnesium. She went to the doctor yesterday, but she didn&#39;t see the doctor and only saw the nurse. She underwent thyroid test on Friday, 29Jan2021 and it was within range. The TSH was not high, meaning she was getting the correct amount. She doesn&#39;t know how quickly taking the half thyroid pill would have effected it at that point. Supposedly she is within range, but still was having palpitations. Some days are really bad and other days not so bad. The levothyroxine sodium is the same prescription bottle. She just switched from taking it orally to sublingual. She took it orally for the first several months and then switched to sublingual, for both, she would take half of the tablet in the morning and half at night because she was so reactive to medication. She was concerned if she should get the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine because &#34;you never know.&#34; The patient further reported that she saw the cardiologist in the fall, and he did EKG and didn&#39;t find anything unusual. She is going to go see him again tomorrow because her other doctor said if the heart palpitations are bad enough, she needs to go to the ER and get EKG. She just had EKG in the fall. She knows it was a reaction to something. As soon as she started getting more thyroid medication in her, it went away. The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown and for BNT162B2 was not applicable.  Outcome of the event heart palpitations/ palpitations was not recovered.

                                                pain in chest through back; tongue swelled up; difficulty swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine; lot number EL9764/EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 01Feb2021 09:45 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing three stents in her artery, heart issue where they took test to see if she had a heart issue, and everything came back negative, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, overweight, penicillin allergy, IV iodine allergy, allergy to pollens, inhalants, dust and animals. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin (DILANTIN), bacitracin;neomycin sulfate;polymyxin b sulfate (NEOSPORIN) and cefalexin (KEFLEX); all of which patient experienced allergies/ drug hypersensitivity. On 01Feb2021 09:45, immediately after receiving the vaccine, her tongue swelled up, she had difficulty swallowing, and she has a pain in her chest that went through to her back. The patient was sent and admitted to the ER and got an IV shot injection of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) that got tongue back down. She didn&#39;t need an Epi pen, it wasn&#39;t that bad. They took the test to see if she had a heart issue, and everything came back negative. The patient was advised by the head of ER that she shouldn&#39;t get the second shot because of the reaction. It could be more severe with the second dose he said. The outcome of the events was recovered on 01Feb2021.

A 74-years-old female patient received BNT162B2, dose 2, via intramuscular, administered in right arm on 16Mar2021 10:00 AM (Lot Number: EN6204; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility type was hospital. Medical history included eczema from 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms and had mild allergies to mold and juniper. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 74-year-old on 23Feb2021 at 10:00AM (lot number: EN6198, Expiry: Jun2021) intramuscular injection in left arm and experienced pain at injection site and couldn&#39;t sleep. The patient also took Prolia shots for arthritis. The patient experienced headache, nausea, pain at injection site and hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold on 16Mar2021, passed out, weakness and disorientation when walking on 17Mar2021, a little tired on 18Mar2021. The clinical course included: The patient was calling about the second vaccine that she got on 16Mar2021 (Tuesday). She was calling about the after effects. They were quite huge. She had a headache, nausea, weakness, and disorientation when walking. Stated she obviously had pain at the site of injection. Stated some of it was her own fault, and at first she felt fine. On the same day that she got her second dose of the covid vaccine, she had a glass of wine and was not too hungry. She ate a little that evening. The next morning she passed out. Clarified that she had two glasses of wine, not one. Caller&#39;s daughter was a doctor. Caller referd to her daughter as doctor daughter. Stated that she told her daughter about what happened. Her daughter told her it was because she was dehydrated. Her daughter told her that it was called vagus something or another. Her daughter was not there with the caller. Her daughter called it vagus something, she does not remember. Her daughter told her that it had to do with inflammation and her immune system. Caller stated she also has arthritis. Her daughter told her that she was stupid for drinking wine after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine and not eating a full meal. Whenever she passed out and fell, she did not hurt herself but it was a wake up call. She realized she was vulnerable. She was calling because she did not know why no one told her to drink a lot of water after receiving the vaccine. She got a Prolia shot in July and the nurses told her to drink a lot of water. She was asking why the nurses who gave her the covid vaccine are not saying that to people. Her daughter told her to call the doctors office about this, and she told her daughter that it was over with now, she&#39;s 95%, she was a little tired on 18Mar2021. She was unconscious for 15 seconds per her husband. Her husband was shouting her name, and she did not hear anything. She wanted to call and report that the nurses should tell people to drink water. One more thing, her daughter told her that the covid vaccine was slowly released. About 10 hours after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold. She got the vaccine about 10AM, and about 10PM at night is whenever her hand got cold. She had pain at the injection site where she had the first dose of the vaccine too. She had more pain at injection site after the second dose of the vaccine. It was not awful, but only if she pressed on it. Clarified that she gets Prolia shots twice a year for her arthritis. Luckily whenever she started to get dizzy, she braced her self, whenever she fell, she did not fall from an upright position. She was crouched over, and fell against trays that fell with her. Her doctor daughter told her that inflammation was because of her immune system. One other thing was that she has been stung in the past and had extreme reactions from yellow jackets in the 90&#39;s. She thought her immune system was sensitive. One other things related to her autoimmune from 3 years ago. She moved to a city in 2012. Everyone told her after 5 years she would develop allergies. In 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms. It was not just like a topical thing where she scratched and itched, it was under her skin. She went to a dermatologist and he took a biopsy, but the results just said eczema. She went to an allergist, he finally found a space on her underarms where he could do a test. The test showed that she had mild allergies to mold and juniper. Juniper is a tree that they have there, she has one in her back yard. Her allergy was very mild. She tried everything, and in 4 months it went away. Now she just latherers her skin with coconut oil. Her diagnosis that this autoimmune issue was related her immune response from the yellow jacket reaction is a self diagnosis. A doctor had never told her this, this was coming from her own self. Clarified that she is calling about the second dose of the pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Headache: It was not a bad headache, it was more like pressure all across the top. Whenever she went to sleep, the headache started. She got the second dose of the covid vaccine on 16Mar2021. She had a little bit of a headache this morning. A cup of coffee with milk made it better. Nausea: It started whenever she did not want to eat dinner. She could tell her stomach was not right. The nausea and headache started together about 12 hours after her vaccine at 10:00 PM. Weakness: She noticed weakness on the next day whenever she got up to use the bathroom. Clarified as the early morning of 17Mar2021. Her weakness was about 90 percent resolved. Disorientation when walking: Clarified that her disorientation was in reference to walking only right before she fell. She was not mentally disoriented. Mentally she knew that she was not doing well. Second dose: pain at injection site: The pain only lasted for about 2-3 hours. It was now absolutely minimal. She would have to press on it to feel anything. Her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold: She got the second dose of the covid vaccine around 10:00 AM, and noticed her hand was cold about 5:00 PM., about 7-8 hours later. Whenever she went to bed, she was cold. She thought that it resolved by the next morning. The morning after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine, she passed out: She passed out about 8:15 AM. The outcome of the events headache, nausea, weakness, pain at injection site was recovering. The outcome of the events disorientation when walking and her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold was recovered on 17Mar2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                February 17, 2021:  Patient received 1st dose of PfizerBioNTech vaccine.  Reported mild cough, nausea and bone pain lasting one week. However, she felt it wasn&#39;t severe enough to contact me as her asthma specialist.  No cough per patient for the week prior to the second dose of PfizerBioNTech. March 10, 2021:  Patient received 2nd dose of PfizerBioNTech vaccine at 1:10pm.  Said she had mild chest tightness during the waiting period and used her Ventolin but she attributed it to the characteristics of the waiting room area.  Between 5:00pm and 6:00pm (~4 hours later), she became light-headed, vomited and began to cough frequently.  She contacted her primary care physician who told her to use Mucinex and contact me if needed. March 12, 2021:  Patient contacted my office in the early afternoon.  Unable to stop coughing while on telephone.  Came to office approximately 90 minutes later.  Physical Exam;  Peak Flow 210 (personal best 310-320), oxygen saturation 93-95% (typically 97-98%), temp-98.2 F.  Intractable cough with scattered bilateral expiratory wheezes on auscultation.  Heart rate 132 and regular.  Patient treated with Levalbuterol 1.25 mg nebulization with subsequent modest improvement in frequency of cough, pulse 102, oxygen saturation 96-97%.  She declined going to emergency department of hospital because she did not want to get infected with COVID-19 from a patient in the waiting room.  She declined Prednisone when told that the corticosteroid might reduce the efficacy of the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Placed on Budesonide 1 mg bid and Levalbuterol 1.25 mg q4-6h prn. March 16th:  Patient reported her cough was 70% improved and wanted to stop Budesonide.  Patient was told to continue Budesonide daily at 1 mg q day. April 5th:  Patient contacted my office because of continued coughing and wheezing.  Had been hospitalized March 25-27 for the cough.

This 75-year-old female consumer (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 09Jan2021. Relevant history included High blood pressure. Relevant concomitant drugs included Losartan for Blood pressure high, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient had the first Covid 19 Vaccine on 09Jan2021 and she knew little bit dizziness was normal but she had a nose bleed in the next morning that she could hardly stop, she finally got it stopped it, it left she little weak so she just wanted to report that, she did not know if anyone had ever had that before (Hence, MI was made). Outcome of event Nose bleed was recovered, the outcome of other event was unknown.

I was anxious as I have anxiety disorder! But my face was RED and TIRED looking. I asked staff what wrong. No swelling at that time! 4:40 PM.  That nite, my heart started POUNDING HARD all night, not stop. Ativan not help. I slept, weird dreams, wake up and still heart pounding.  8 am --- got up and hands, arms, extremities SWOLLEN!! Heart still pounding,  Felt like allergic to MSG or nitrates or preservatives or too much salt. Felt weird.. Not faint-- just weird. Tired from the pounding heart. Not fatigued.  I did have sore arm, but it was NOT an issue.  My hands, toes were red.

A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

She reported that on Friday patient collapsed and started foaming at the mouth and was rushed to hospital. She stated that  patient is on a ventilator and at 5PM today they are going to take her off. Sister was very upset and I was uncomfortable asking more questions. She will call me with more information at a later time. She did say that the hospital staff was not sure of what caused her collapse.

                                                I woke up feeling sick with headache and pain in abdomen, went to bathroom and sat down, I was burning up and perspiration was dripping down my body, i felt like i might throw up and that was the last though until I came to on the floor of our walk in shower.  It took me a while to orient myself and get up and sat down again on toilet still with pain in head and disoriented. next thing i know i am coming to wedged between the toilet tank and the vanity.  I managed to get back on the toilet and sat there wondering what was happening to me.  I could tell i was getting better so i just sat there a while longer until i though my legs would hold me so i could get back to the bed.  I laid in bed the rest of the night unable to sleep with headache and shivering with being cold even under my blankets. I stayed in bed Saturday then called the doctor first thing Monday morning. I got in to see her at 10:30 Monday morning.  She ordered a full blood panel and urinalysis and heart monitor for 48 hours.  The blood panel and urinalysis reports are all ok.  Have not received report yet from the heart monitor.  Doc said I cannot take the second shot.

A 75-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Jan2021 04:00, she went to bed at night and woke up at 4 AM with a severe headache. She took Aleve and went back to bed. When she woke up at 8:30 AM her headache was very severe and was accompanied with very severe chest pain. She immediately took her to the ER. They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on February 5th but we are very concerned and hesitant as we don&#39;t want to cause any more damage to her heart. The patient was hospitalized for events &#39;headache&#39;, &#39;chest pain;&#39;, &#39;pericarditis&#39; and &#39;pain&#39; for 4 days. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination and did not received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included imaging: pericarditis on 16Jan2021 and Nasal Swab: negative on 16Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events which included Colchicine and prednisone, morphine and dilaudid. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events &#34;headache&#34;, &#34;chest pain&#34;, &#34;pericarditis&#34;and &#34;severe pain&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and disability. The events &#34;myalgia&#34;, &#34;asthenia&#34; and &#34;dyspnea&#34; were assessed as serious due to disability. The events (&#39;headache&#39;, &#39;chest pain;&#39;, &#39;pericarditis&#39; and &#39;pain&#39;) resulted in emergency room visit.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

It was noted that patient has had intermittent syncope since August of 2020 and clinical interpretation is likely that pericardial effusion pre dated vaccination.  In her workup for dizziness and syncope she had not previously undergone EKG, chest x-ray or echocardiogram therefore pericardial effusion could have been missed.  I elected to report the  pericardial effusion to be on the side of caution.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.

A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 21Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, amlodipine besilate (manufacturer unknown) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 10 mg twice a day for high blood pressure, insulin human (NOVOLIN R) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing as needed (U-100, inject 5 units by sliding scale if blood sugar over 150) for diabetes, clonidine oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 0.2mg daily, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.3 mg daily for high blood pressure, hydrazine oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 200 mg two times a day (2 tablets by mouth in the morning, 2 tablets by mouth in the evening) for high blood pressure. Medical history included ongoing thyroid nodule and her thyroid was okay and her numbers okay for cholesterol, ongoing dialysis, high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Since taking the vaccine, the past 4-5 days the patient&#39;s blood pressure and blood sugar had been out of whack. The patient had said something to her doctors about this because something was going on because she has been having to use her sliding scale insulin when her sugar got to 150. Usually was under 150 and if she went over that she took a shot of insulin if necessary. She had used insulin human more in the past few days at least once a day. The patient had not had to use insulin human in past, it was still almost full. Again, the patient had taken more shots since this Covid than she had had in a whole year. The patient just talked to the kidney doctor and then she was going to the Endocrinologist on Thursday for the first time. They maintain her blood sugar records at dialysis center. Blood sugar usually was between 115-130 and now last night it had been 168 and higher. The patient knew something was not right and it had not been like that for so long. The patient spoke with the dialysis doctor on 01Feb2021 about her blood pressure and they adjusted her medication. The patient clarified her blood pressure had also been high. When she left 01Feb2021 her blood pressure was 168/79 and later that day was 189/70 which was very unusual for her. The other day when she went home it was 136/78. It was the Clonidine that was adjusted was taking 0.1mg, 2 tablets a day to now taking 3 a day. The action taken in response to the events for amlodipine besilate, insulin human, clonidine, hydrazine was dose not changed. The outcome of events was not recovered.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [Amlodipine Besilate] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [Amlodipine Besilate] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.

Her daughter took her to the hospital and did multiple tests and said that she had a pronounced inflammatory response to the vaccine and developed a pericardial effusion and pericarditis.  They sent her home with steroids and Colchicine.  They did not want to put her on NSAIDS due to possible ulcers.  She all the COVID symptoms, and had severe pain still.  Her daughter 3 weeks later took her to the cardiologist.  She had an EKG and Echo and now was in atrial flutter due to the response to the vaccine.  She was then sent to the ER again, and went there twice.  He has put her on medications and now is doing better, she is still weak and has to take Colchicine for 3 months, is on blood thinners and now has sleep issues.  They also put her on some hypertensive medications to make sure that she does not go back into atrial flutter.  She is now back in sinus rhythm.  She was advised not to get the 2nd vaccine due to the reactions from the first one.     She was admitted the first time for 4 days and then 2 trips to the ER and then another admission for 4 more days, so a total of 10 days in the hospital.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-02), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper forearm on 01Mar2021 at the age of 75-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a pharmacy (in a grocery store). The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient&#39;s medical history included retired (retired registered nurse), ongoing depression (has had this condition for probably 20 years), ongoing lung cancer (has had this condition for probably 3 years), ongoing bipolar (has had this condition for about 4 years), ongoing emphysema (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years), and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years). Concomitant medications included duloxetine taken for depression from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been taking this probably for 15 years); and arformoterol tartrate (BROVANA) (started taking this probably 5 years ago), budesonide (started taking this probably 5 years ago), tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) (has been taking this for probably about 4-5 years), oxygen (has been using this full time for 3 years), and Trilogy machine (she sleeps with this, it is an invasive intubation. She puts a big mask on and it pumps air in, pulls air out, letting her lungs rest. Her oxygen hooks up to it), all taken for emphysema and COPD from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient reported that she received the vaccine on 01Mar2021 and sometime in Apr2021 around Easter, she went to the hospital for COPD exacerbation, tiredness and weakness. The patient required a visit to the emergency room due to the events and reported that she went by ambulance to the hospital. The patient stated that she has these events often and it has nothing to do with the COVID vaccine. She went to the hospital with exacerbation of COPD and missed her date to get her last shot. She wanted to know whether she can get the 2nd dose of the vaccine with her experience after the 1st dose. The patient reported that she now weighs 177 after she has been pumped full of cortisone. The patient reported that her lung doctor was really the one that manages her medical. The patient reported that she thinks she came home from the hospital the day before Easter and she was in the hospital for 5 days (in Apr2021). She was sick before that, at home, and she finally had to call # to come and get her. She believes she had to call # the 5th day before Easter, but she was not positive. When asked to clarify what she meant by sick, the patient explained she was extremely tired, she couldn&#39;t get out of bed and couldn&#39;t move. She was having trouble breathing. She was on oxygen 24/7 and sleeps with a trilogy machine so she was having a lot of trouble, it was awful. She said she then found out at the hospital her red blood cell was below 5 and her iron was critically low. They had to give her 2 units of blood and an infusion. Then she went back yesterday and got another infusion and she has to go back next week for another infusion. The patient confirmed that she was hospitalized for COPD. She then stated she didn&#39;t know the exact date of when she was discharged from the hospital, but she was thinking it was the day she was scheduled for her second shot. She then clarified she came home Easter. The patient reported that she can&#39;t do much without having to sit down, catch her breath, and rest a little bit. She was improving but not as fast as she&#39;d like to. While reading the vaccine record card, the patient stated &#34;my eyes aren&#39;t as good as they used to be&#34;. Her pulmonologist stated she was going to die if she doesn&#39;t take the vaccine. If she catches COVID she was not going to make it, so her pulmonologist thinks her chances are better with the vaccine than without it. The patient said she goes all the time to the hospital; therefore, she doesn&#39;t think the events were related to the vaccine. She had been sick several times. They can&#39;t do anything about the bleeding, they can&#39;t go in to do anything because of her lungs, her lungs were so bad. No further details were provided regarding the bleeding she was speaking of. The patient reported that duloxetine doesn&#39;t come as 90 mg so she takes a 30 mg and 60 mg tablet; she mixes the Brovana and Budesoind and takes them at the same time, twice a day. She was given an albuterol solution, 0.5mg PRN (as needed), for her emphysema/COPD. She says she just started taking this from her last hospital stay. The patient reported that she did not remember her iron count, just that it was critically low. She did remember asking the nurse what could happen, and the nurse said a lot of things such as infection. She confirmed tests were done in regards to the lung cancer. Her lungs were too critical for any kind of invasive tests. It was reported that the events Exacerbation of COPD and &#34;extremely tired, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t move&#34; were assessed by the patient as unrelated to BNT162B2. The outcome of the events &#34;Exacerbation of COPD/having trouble breathing&#34; and &#34; extremely tired, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t move/tiredness&#34; was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the narrative information provided, the reported events Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Fatigue, Asthenia, Blood iron decreased, Red blood cell count decreased and Asthenia are assessed as intercurrent medical conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection).

                                                infection; Abnormal nose bleed with blood cloths the first day; Abnormal nose bleed with blood cloths the first day/6 more nose bleed that it was taking me to control up to 30 min; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 75-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 10:45 (at 75 years old, not pregnant), single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Type II diabetes, Hypertension, GERD and hypercholesterilymia, sulfa allergy, all from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included verapamil; rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR); metformin; omeprazole, unspecified blood thinners. The patient previously took tetracycline for known allergies: Tethracycline. Patient experienced abnormal nose bleed with blood cloths the first day (reported as 30Mar2021 0130). Five days later in two days had 6 more nose bleed that it was taking me to control up to 30 min. She went to ER in the morning and had a CBC having results normal with normal levels of platelets. She was referred to PCP. She saw a NP next day and gave me referral to ENT specialist. Using an scope could not find anything and ordered to have CT Scan. Results show negative for polips, tumors and show only a shadow by eye socket which MD believe it was an infection that was leading to the bleed. Prescribe a very small amount of Amoxicilline 125 mg, twice a day for 7 days plus a saline gel. Patient had the last nose bleed at midnight. For 3 days did not have any bleeding until today, at 10:15 am, with heavy bleeding which took me 15 min. to control. She has no history of nose bleed, taking blood thinners, no head traumas either. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination. No Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event infection was unknown, other events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Information provided was so limited to prevent a meaningful and definite medical assessment for the events. A causal relationship cannot be completely excluded for BNT162B2 injection and development of Thrombosis and Epistaxis, only based on a plausible chronological sequence.
