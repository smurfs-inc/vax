                                                One week post Injection, on 12/28, I noticed a hard lump on my left clavicle  (about 1.5 inches in size)-same side as injection. It was painful and partially mobile.  No other symptoms other than those of headache a few days prior mentioned below. I went to urgent care on 12/29 where CXR and soft tissue ultrasound were ordered. CXR normal. US 12/30 showed cluster of lymph nodes in that area.   Lump appears to be smaller this week and not painful.   Also, I developed a severe migraine on 12/26 (5d post vaccine). So severe that it was debilitating which is unusual for me. It lasted approximately 36 hours.

As the day progressed I got chills, started running a fever, It went up to 104 and my heart rate went up and down from 120-165 so I went to the ER. They gave me  fluids and ran a whole bunch of test, tested me for Covid and Sepsis and everything came back normal and negative for Covid. They monitored my heart rate and once it started getting back to normal, they ended up letting me go home, I was there from 8pm to about 3am.  After that I felt tired and felt like when   I had Covid back in November.  I started feeling better about Sunday, still a little tired but felt more back to normal.  My heart rate is still getting back to normal so my Dr is following me on that.

                                                Around at 7AM when I arrived at work I started feeling chills, took temperature 99.5F that is already elevated for me.  About 9:30 my temp was 101.8F and they sent me home.  I just had the chills and fever.  I got home and developed a headache and around 1PM I started feeling really dizzy. The temperature did not subside and the next day I woke up and I couldn&#39;t function, I felt really dizzy I kept laying down and drinking water, I could not keep anything down my stomach did not feel well. I felt like I had to vomit. When I sat down in the toilet then my ears started ringing pretty bad all of a sudden I could not hear anything and I passed out in the toilet. My husband found me and tried to wake me up. After that I still feel dizzy. I did not have any appetite either. I could barely hold water. The next day I was not as dizzy but my stomach was still upset but I could hold some soup down but then started with diarrhea. Employee health kept calling me everyday and I did the the telehealth appt and I also had a little bit of a rash in my chest that appeared all of a sudden red like a streak. The dizziness I had for the first 4 days, diarrhea did not come until the 3rd day and I had it for 2 days and my temperature was back to normal on the 4th day. Everything started to get better (my stomach stopped feeling queezy) around the 4th day but still felt fatigued until about 12/29/2020.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine  Approximately 24 hours after injection I felt dyspnea with minimal exertion and at rest while wearing my hospital mask, which I attributed to the cheap quality of the mask.  Breathlessness was relieved after I took it off.  I shoveled snow with no problem over the weekend, and was off work.  Three days later, on 1/3 around 7 pm, I experience the same feeling while wearing the same type of mask, and it was relieve when I took it off.   The following day, 1/4 around 2pm, while wearing a different disposable mask in the grocery store, felt extremely overheated and realized I was having difficulty breathing with minimal exertion.  This time the feeling did not pass when I left the store/removed my mask, and residual effects of not being able to easily take a deep breath stayed with me the entire day.   The feeling was gone in the morning, but did eventually re-occur the next day (tightness in my lungs not allowing for easy deep breaths) on 1/5 near the end of a shift where I had been wearing yet a different type of disposable mask. The symptoms starting around 4:30 pm and lasted throughout the rest of the evening.  At this point I notified employee heath and scheduled a covid test.   The next two days, on 1/6 and 1/7, the same type of dyspnea persisted throughout the day; while at rest, not relieved, and with no other symptoms (no cough, fever, etc.)   Ibuprofen appears to relieve the discomfort, and I have returned to work, however the symptoms are still present if I am not taking Ibuprofen.  Possibly some kind of pleurisy.  My lung sounds are clear.

                                                Received vaccine at 1730, then just before midnight my heart began to pound hard and very fast, and it made me feel short of breath or as though I had to cough. After about a minute I thought it might be SVT so I did a valsalva maneuver and it stopped.  I was resting in bed, no alcohol or caffeine, and this has never happened to me before. Since then, I have felt at least one heart palpitation per day, sometimes many more. The last few days I have felt extremely fatigued and have had an odd sensation in my chest. On 1/7 I developed a dry cough, and was swabbed for Covid because I felt so bad. It was negative. This made me wonder if the odd sensation in my chest was related to my heart and not my lungs. I am due for my second vaccine today, and am unsure if I should get it.

I am under the assumption this is likely a swollen lymph node post second vaccination. I have taken ibuprofen in attempt to help with pain and inflammation but does not seem to be helping much at this time. I anticipate this will improve over time.

She has had the expected fatigue, muscle aches, headache, chills.   however, she had also developed significant swelling in her left armpit and the swelling has spread into her left chest wall and down into her left ribs. It has also become painful. It?s very painful to lower her arm against her body, to raise her arm above her shoulder, to lift anything, even a bottle of water. It?s also painful to take a deep breathe right in the area on the left chest where the swelling is and into her ribs under her armpit. The area doesn?t seem to be significant red or warm. It is very tender to touch and the swollen area is firm.  It has not responded to ice or NSAIDS. Her shoulder and arm do not seem to have any swelling.&#34;

                                                Prior to 1st Covid vaccination the patient reported a history of mast cell syndrome resulting in numerous anaphylactic events.  The patient had been consulted by her immunologist to proceed with vaccination and due to her history she was observed for a period of 30 minutes.  Upon returning for her 2nd vaccination she reported that she experienced some skin manifestations (hives) but no anaphylactic reaction resulting in difficulty breathing.  She stated that she had discussed this again with her immunologist and she wished to proceed with the 2nd dose and she was prepared to receive EpiPen if necessary if reaction develops.  Within 10 minutes of the vaccination she felt flushing sensation and then itching all over and her &#34;throat closing up&#34;.  She was quickly administered 0.3 mg IM epinephrine and IM diphenyhydramine with some improvement in her symptoms.  While being transported to the ED an additional 0.3 mg dose of epinephrine was administered.  The emergency department also administered the following treatments: famotidine 40 IV x 1 dose, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1 dose, racepinephrine nebulized x 1 dose.  The patient was ultimately discharged approximately 2 hours later with return to her baseline condition.

My Left Leg (entire leg) was swollen &amp; Numb) I received my vaccine and when I arrived home about 1pm that day My leg felt odd.  when walking, standing I felt an odd sensation in my left foot/lower calf area.  I had body aches mild which progressed at night especially pain running down my left side of my body.   The next morning I put on my clothes for work and my body still mild aches but the pant leg was tight especially around the calf.  My My left foot was swollen as well as my shoe fit tighter.  I also had a numbing sensation through the leg.  I had an ache behind the calf and the heel of my foot as well as the left foot of my left foot.  The swelling remained and I worried I might have a DVT.  I called my primary care DR office and they said I should go to the ER.  I called employee health at my job and they told me go to the ER.  So on 12/29/2020 I went to the ER.  The providers there also thought I had a DVT especially after examining my leg and recognizing the significant swelling.  My US venous doppler showed negative for DVT however a significantly enlarged lymph node.  As of today the swelling is much improved however still slight.  The sensation in my left foot is still not the same as before.  I have a numbness and tingling sensation that runs from my Left lateral calf down to the sole of my foot.

                                                Anxiety; Headache; Seeing stars; Chest tightness; Hand tremor; SOB; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 40-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1284; Expiration date was not reported), intramuscularly on the left arm on 06Jan2021 (10:15) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included migraines; heart murmur with surgery; grand mal seizure that has resolved; and contrast dye allergy. Concomitant medications included sumatriptan and norethindrone [norethisterone]. The patient previously took phenytoin, iodine, terconazole, tramadol and cetirizine; and had allergies with these medications. On 06Jan2021 (10:15), the patient was seeing stars; had chest tightness; hand tremor; and shortness of breath (SOB). The patient was referred to the Urgent Care Clinic due to these events. On 06Jan2021 (12:30), at the Urgent Clare Clinic, the patient had anxiety and headache. The patient had received acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, ibuprofen and water as treatment for the events, &#39;seeing stars&#39;, &#39;chest tightness&#39;, &#39;hand tremor&#39; and &#39;shortness of breath&#39;; and was provided with education on managing anxiety. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021 for &#39;seeing stars&#39;, &#39;chest tightness&#39;, &#39;hand tremor&#39; and &#39;shortness of breath&#39;; and was unknown for &#39;headache&#39; and &#39;anxiety&#39;. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested post-vaccination.

My swallowing felt slightly off however, I was not aspirated secretions. My throat felt slightly thick and I had the sensation of wanting to clear my throat. I took a deep breath and I could breath.  It started to feel like my throat was getting sore or irritated. I felt slightly warmer. I decided to wait the full 30 minutes. When I went to stand had a moment of dizziness that passed but then I felt lightheadedness for about 2 hours after the injection. My ear felt like it was warm and there was slight pressure there. My throat continued to feel irritated and still feels lightly irritated after 4 days.  After about 3 hours it felt like something lifted and I felt better. That night I was really fatigued and tired. Maybe slightly cold. The next day felt fine except for the throat irritation that still persists today.  The side where I received the injection my arm, shoulder, and chest area felt affected for two days after receiving injection.

                                                Severe hypertension. Following the second dose I was having severe headaches. I checked my blood pressure on 2/17/21 and it was 212/116. I was having palpitations and parathesia in my right foot. I immediately contacted my provider and he confirmed my hypertension and I was prescribed two separate anti hypertensive medications. I began these medications however they have been ineffective at treating the high blood pressure. I began to have chest pains, headaches continued, and due to the hypertensive crisis I presented to the ER on 3/3/21 which required IVP BP medications, EKG,  cardiac labs, etc. Prior to the COVID vaccination I have always had a normal blood pressure at all of my physical appointments.

Provider walked in and spoke with her regarding an adrenaline release causing some of her symptoms. Over the 5 minutes, patient became less shaky, BP and HR dropping. She stated she felt much better. She discharged with instructions to follow up with her PCP if needed. Provider felt she could discharge home. Several days later, patient reported continued &#34;woozy&#34; feeling, chills, and elevated HR. She was seen in the ED at that time, with no remarkable findings.

See in urgent care at work, EKG showed ectopy. She was sent to the nearby emergency room, where she was monitored and given iv fluids, oxygen and tylenol. She is feeling better today one day later, and will have follow-up with cardiology. Vaccine administration may have set off underlying predisposition for PVC&#39;s, ectopy. Was aware of PVC&#39;s previously but well-controlled on diltiazem. Has now been switched to metoprolol.

My left upper thigh had a burning feeling around the outer part and in the goin on that thigh a painful lymph node. That afternoon I had a burning sensation on my left butt cheek. When I looked I noticed a very small rash with blisters. I waited through the weekend because I knew the OBGYN was not open. I called first thing Monday morning and made an appointment as soon as they could see me which was the next day  (1/5/2021)at 3:30pm. The doctor took samples and sent them to the lab for testing. The test was positive for shingles. I am now taking valtrex for shingles.

Finally tried 2 puffs of my son?s albuterol about 5 hrs post vaccine and felt relief within 20?30 minutes.  The next day I had more expected side effects: headache, myalgias, chills and fatigue.  No recurrence of the chest symptoms.

                                                24 hours after the injection I had a sore arm, developed slight body aches and headache.  Since the injection I had been getting headaches almost daily, mostly on my right side of my head.  On Dec. 5, 2021 I noticed I was getting a sore eyebrow.  Later that evening ok noticed swollen lymph nodes throughout my scalp, face, ear, jaw, neck and chest.  My eyebrow also started to swell and was slightly pink.  When the swelling was worse the next day - I went to urgent care and saw A doctor that diagnosed me with facial cellulitis.  After a couple days my eye was not getting any better and started to itch severely.  Called to urgent care over the weekend and takes to one of the providers who said to use cold compresses and elevate my head as much as I could.  On Dec. 11, 2021 I called back to the provider I had seen on Dec. 6 - he told me he believed I had developed shingles and to go to the eye doctor that day.  I saw a doctor on Dec. 11 &amp; was diagnosed with shingles.  They started me on antivirals along with the antibiotics they had prescribed on Dec. 6.

I went over to find the employee sitting in the person&#39;s office in a chair. She was able to tell me she received her first COVID vaccine approx 30 mins ago. She stated she stayed there for the 15 mins after the vaccine with no reaction. She is now having ringing in her ears, feeling lightheaded, hot, nauseaus, and &#34;I feel like I am in a cloud.&#34; She denies allergies or past hx of vaccine reactions. Denies hx of anaphylaxis. She denied any sob or chest pain. Employee was holding her head. She stated she had only had some coffee and juice today and was feeling hot. BP was taken and was 112/90 and she is not tachy and no resp distress observed. Patient was able to speak to me in full complete sentences initially. Another person came over and the employee was asked if she could stand and walk. Employee stated she felt she could stand and walk and when she did this she had to hold onto something to avoid falling and she was sat back down. Emergency services was called and employees speech was slow and almost slurred at times. Emergency services arrived and transported employee.

A 41-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number EJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM (at the age of 41-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included that the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient did not receive other medication in the two weeks prior to the vaccination. On 19Dec2020 14:00 PM, the patient experienced a swollen lymph node approximately the size of a baseball that developed under her left armpit. It took about 5 days to completely resolve. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The patient had not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The outcome of the event, swollen lymph node, was recovered, in Dec2020.

When driving  home from work, she instantly felt really hot and had a lot of flushing that felt like a hot flash. Hot all over. Had to pull over and take off layers of clothes. Sat with the air on in the car. Burning sensation when she got home felt like brillo pad  was used on face. Burning sensation on cheek all the way down to chin. Face was really on fire. Today, the burning sensation have gotten better, but her cheeks still have prickly, tight sensation. Headache at 8pm yesterday when she was trying to go to bed at the back of the head. Felt like a lot of pressure.

                                                Immediately experienced racing heart and severe dry mouth. My KARDIA 6-lead EKG stated &#34;Possible AFib&#34; and heart rate was 145-155. Blood pressure became elevated much higher than baseline (Normal is 90/60). Paramedics came to evaluate and performed numerous 12-lead EKG&#39;s and noted multiple Premature Ventricular Contractions and transported me to the hospital where I was observed and consulted on from ED Physician. Later was evaluated by electrophysiology cardiologist with echocardiogram and EKG. Multiple physicians have advised not to get second vaccine.

                                                Within 25 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my left arm became very heavy and there was a tingling/neuro sensation in left wrist/hand. A pressure began in the  anterior of my throat which increased gradually. I sought treatment in our Urgent Care just after noon that same day. The Provider monitored my vitals which were good and administered liquid Pepcid. Said Provider chose not to give Benadryl as I had taken Zyrec that morning for my allergies. I was discharged from the Urgent Care and went back to work at 1245. At 1730 hours, I had a slight headache above my right eye and extreme right-sided jaw pain with tooth sensitivity. These lasted for only 10 minutes. At 1830, the anterior and bilateral portions of my throat began to feel &#34;prickly&#34; and I developed a wheeze. I used an albuterol inhaler to relieve the wheeze successfully. At this time I also developed an itchiness throughout my whole body, worse on left side than right side. I took 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. At 0300, I took another dose of 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. I also took an itch pill/antihistamine of my husband&#39;s which provided no relief. At 0800, I took 20 mg of Zyrtec. At 1030, I took 100mg of Benadryl. I continued to use Benadryl throughout the day, every 4-5 hours.  At 1800, I had a fullness in my throat, a tightness in my chest and my left shoulder blade felt almost numb.  I also had a hoarse voice which passed by the next morning. The chest tightness was intermittent over the next day or two.  On Friday, the itchiness had improved some but was still prominent. I continued to use Zyrtec and Benadryl throughout the day. My Primary Doctor called in Prednisone if needed. By Saturday morning, I felt MUCH better. Today is Sunday and I am no longer itching and I feel so much better today.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 06Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose as COVID-19 vaccine. Medical history included anaemia and anaphylactic reaction to shellfish. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine, and had no other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. There were no concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021, within 2 hours (at 12:00 PM), the patient experienced blurred vision, within 4 hours tachycardia and dizziness, within 8 hours headache, chills, body aches, and extreme fatigue, and within 12 hours, tightness in her chest, SOB, extreme fatigue, and body aches. As treatment, the patient received ibuprofen. The patient stated that she had a pretty severe reaction. She also informed her employer but nobody helped. They observed her 15 mins. post-vaccination. She was fine within 15 minutes. It was also reported that within 2 hours, she had blurry vision, tachycardia, and felt dizzy. In the middle of the day, she felt chills, shivers, dizziness, bloating, and headache. The patient also stated that she experienced shakes and taking a shower hurt, also, chest was tight all day. It was further reported that when she was sent back home from work, she started having a severe body ache, fatigue, chills, and shivers. She experienced tightness in her chest , shortness of breath, and she could barely get out of bed. This lasted all day. She still had the blurred vision and couldn&#39;t focus on her cell phone. She felt a little bit better today but was still not 100%. She contacted her MD who advised her to report this to Pfizer. The patient wanted to know if it was safe to receive the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. It was reported that the events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Outcome of the event &#39;Vision blurred&#39; was not recovered, for the event &#39;Tremor&#39; was unknown, while for the rest of the events was recovering. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

In the patient&#39;s own words, &#34;After receiving the COVID vaccine, I became very dizzy and weak. I felt like I was going to pass out more than once. Arms, legs, hands, and feet tingled, then went numb. Heart started racing, and I felt warm all over. My coworker told me I was very pale. I looked up reactions on the site and decided go to the ER and get checked. On the way over, I become slightly SOB. Once there my BP and HR was elevated, but after about an hour or so returned to normal. I still felt very weak and had some hand and leg tingling&#34;.

Hives went up from my chest to my neck and eventually to my face. About 30 mins after hives started, my breathing became labored. I took 3 Benadryl and was preparing to give my self an EpiPen injection. Benadryl was enough to slowly bring everything back to normal.

Following this immunization, she appropriately stayed in the waiting area for the 30 minutes. She then got in car and 15 minutes after, she noticed that her tongue was feeling full/swollen and that was experiencing neck swelling. These symptoms persisted and resembled a prior allergic response to Tetracycline and Aleve. Wheezing and breathing difficulty ensued and EMS was activated.   On arrival to the emergency department she was found to have wheezing with stridor.  A dose of epinephrine was administered and she was monitored in the emergency department with an initial improvement in symptoms. Approximately one hour and 30 minutes after initial epinephrine administration patient reported that she was having continued difficulty swallowing and she was starting to feel a little worse.  At this point a second dose of IM epinephrine was administered.    The patient was subsequently  admitted to inpatient medicine team for further monitoring.

                                                About 45 minutes to an hour after the administration of the vaccine m, my cheeks became red, hot, and swollen. There were also hives. I took Benadryl which stopped the spreading but it did not go away. I had shortness of breath, and by about 6:00 it was hard to breath when lying down. I did an albuterol treatment with my nebulizer. It helped but it took much longer than usual. There were was about 30 minutes that I found my epipen and was going to the ED if it got worse.  My breathing improved. The red changed to pink but was still swollen and tight 7 hours later. The second one of Benadryl helped get rid of most of the pinkness. When I woke up this morning, I had a little bit of a wheezy cough that I didn?t have yesterday.  My daily Zyrtec and singular helped that a little. I have new hives along my jawline this morning that are very minor but they do itch. The redness and swelling was similar to reactions I?ve gotten when I drink a beer or have eaten soft shell crab, but typically Benadryl will clear that up and it doesn?t linger for so long.  This was more aggressive. My side effects at this point are minor, but I have a call in to my allergist to see if I should be doing anything different and questions about the second dose.

                                                Anaphylactic shock? Shortly after receiving the vaccine my arm was sore and I had a severe headache. Approximately 24-48 hours after I received the vaccine I started developing a red, hot, itchy raised rash on my ears and buttocks which became more prevalent and peaked around 80-90 hours later. Approximately 82 hours after I received the vaccine, I began to feeI nauseous, dizzy, and fatigued so I stood up to get ready for bed early. While brushing my teeth, I went pale white and felt like I was going to vomit. I put the toothbrush down and got on floor. My pulse felt like it had stopped. I tried to check my pulse and I could only detect one beat every other second. I called for my spouse and by the time he got to bathroom I was passed out. I came back to after about 30 seconds and was convulsing from chills. He put a blanket on me and grabbed my Apple Watch to try to get my pulse which read in the 50s (so I assume it was much lower when I passed out). My hands and feet were tingly and I stayed on the floor until my pulse got back up. I then had diarrhea. At this point in time the rash was most prevalent and was present mostly on my buttocks but also on my ears, scalp, pointer finger on right hand, thighs, and hips. I went to doctor the following morning an my vitals, blood sugar, EKG, urine screen were stable and indicated no issues. 106 hours later I still have the rash on all areas mentioned and am dizzy, nauseous, and fatigued.

                                                About 5 minutes after the shot, I started to feel a tightness in my throat.  It lasted a couple of minutes and then passed. Then about 45 minutes after I started to feel a heaviness/ache in my upper chest. This feeling continued for days. Around day four I began to have a feeling of great pressure in my throat, particularly when swallowing. I noticed that my heartrate was elevated, but that might have been because the feeling was very stressful.  The feeling would increase when I turned my head to the side or put my chin down.This feeling persisted for 3 days. After three days the feeling changed slightly and started feeling more like the sensation one gets when you have food stuck in your throat. As I type this, it is 8 days after the vaccine and I still feel this sensation in my throat.

I went to sit in the waiting area to be monitored and my tongue and lip started itching. I then started w/ a red rash to the R side of my neck. My body started to itch all over.  I was brought into a treatment room and my vital signs were being taken when I started to have an increase in coughing, shortness of breath and vomiting. I was given an epipen and brought to the emergency room when I received Benadryl 50mg IV, Solumedrol 125mg IV, and Pepcid 20mg IV. Approximately 1 hour after receiving the medication my face again began to itch and I was given an additional dose of 25mg of Benadryl. My reaction resolved and I was discharged home with a prescription for prednisone.

When she got home in the evening and took it off blood ran down her arm but the bleeding stopped immediately. This has resolved. 12/29 at about 2:00 employee reports onset of tingling in the fingers of her right hand - index, middle, ring, and pinky. For about 2 hours the tingling was intense. As of 12/30 this has markedly improved and the tingling is intermittent. Later in the evening of 12/29 she noticed the onset of muscle pains throughout her body but especially in her feet. She also became very fatigued. These symptoms linger on 12/30. On 1/1 employee reports symptoms muscle soreness had resolved. 1/4 tingling in her fingers/arm has improved but is still present.

A 42-years-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK5730, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the right arm on 31Dec2020 at 10:15 AM, at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthma, allergy, hypothyroidism, and some fish allergy. There were no concomitant medications (no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks). Patient previously took ibuprofen and experienced allergy. The patient is not pregnant. On 31Dec2020, after ten-15 minutes (10:30 AM) of receiving the vaccine, she was light headed and dizzy with some nausea. Monitored in the emergency room (ER) with high BP 140&#39;s and heart rate (HR) 110s to 120s. After an hour of saline bolus, she was better but she got nasal congestion and swelling of the face with sore throat. On 01Jan2021, after 24 hours, she got some soreness at the injection site with generalized body aches. Also she got some shortness of breath which lead to her asthma attack and difficulty sleeping. On 02Jan2021, after 48hours, she was feeling still light headed with some sore throat, chills, body aches and severe headache which lead her to go to the ER and got herself tested for flu, covid and strep, which came back all negative but her signs and symptoms (s/sx )still after discharge was getting worst especially the headache and generalized body aches. As well as congestion and sore throat. The patient had given &#34;Ivf&#34; for the events. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

This is the same side the injection was given. The injection site is no longer tender to touch but it is difficult to raise my arm and hold it straight due to discomfort. My arm is visibly swollen compared to my left arm. I can feel shotty lymph nodes down my arm.

Remained in the observation room symptom-free for additional 30 minutes.   At home, symptoms of shortness of breath and chest tightness returned and worsened.  Throat felt tight, able to move air, however had trouble swallowing.  Voice was raspy and increased coughing.  From past experience with allergy shots, this was my cue to use epi pen.  Within 5 minutes after using epi pen, all symptoms were resolved.

                                                1/8 - Within 12 hrs had body, eye, and headache.  Overall tired.  Could not do normal daily things without feeling wiped out . 3 Advil did nothing- sat 1/9.  Next day felt better.- sun 1/10.  That evening low grade fever 99.6 and achy again., mostly eyes and head.  Went to bed.  Monday okay. But noticed right armpit a pit puffy.- same side as injection.  Tuesday 1/12 woke up at 6:00am and had dull joint/bone pain bilaterally.  Ranging from neck ache, to sternum/upper back, shoulders, triceps.  Injection site still sore- slightly red off to the side.  Did some stretches in bed and eventually got up.  I am very in tune with my body- something is off.  I never wake up feeling ?bad?.  Fit, healthy and active normally.  Almost like a bad nights sleep with a poor mattress but only affected my upper body.  Took two Advil and hot shower- feel better but can tell something doesn?t feel right.

                                                While patient was receiving her second dose of the Pfizer brand Covid-19 vaccination (at 14:50), she mentioned to me that she had a sustained local reaction to her first dose.  Her arm had a hard, red, hot spot for approximately a week.  At this time I told her we would like her to stay under observation for 30  Min instead of the normal 15 min. At approximately 25 min post vaccination, the pt reported the following: &#34;arm felt heavy, both arms did, but more so the affected arm, instant headache, sore neck, vision went fuzzy, breathing wasn&#39;t difficult but felt labored, throat felt like it was closing/congested, rash on the inside of the affected arm&#34;.    Pt stated that her heart felt like it was &#34;pounding&#34;.    VS:  162/96, 99% RA, HR in the 70&#39;s.    Patient was administered 50ml IM diphenhydramine and monitored for 90 minutes in the clinic area.  Dr. was consulted and also spoke with the pt, advising her to continue with OTC diphenhydramine once at home.     The symptoms resolved after approximately 40 minutes.  By 17:00 the patient was deemed stable to go home with the instructions to go immediately to ED should any further Sx present.  It was verified that she did not live alone and would have someone with her that could assist.    Pt was subsequently followed up with a phone call on the next day by RN who relayed that she was very tired, but no other complications.

A 42-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 23Dec2020 h 09:00 intramuscularly in left deltoid (left arm) lot number: EK5730 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications were not provided. Patient stated that she has had double mastectomy, and missing a lot of lymph nodes, states she got the first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 23Dec2020, states it made her left subclavian lymph nodes swollen and hard. States that when she gets the flu vaccine at her hospital every year, she gets swollen lymph nodes ever since she had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. She originally was wondering if she could get the vaccine in another large muscle group. States she even went as far as to cross reference flu shot ingredients with the Pfizer Covid ingredients to see if something in the vaccines were causing the swollen lymph nodes but was unable to come to any conclusion, the only think in common is the Sodium Chloride and she does not feel like that would cause any issue. States the swollen lymph nodes occurred after the Sanofi brand flu vaccine (no other information known or provided). Patient is on day 15 post vaccination and they are still swollen and hard, she is wondering if there is any data on how long this side effect can last. She made an appointment with her oncologist, she knows that the swollen lymph had the first dose, lymph nodes are still swollen and hard, knows it can cause swollen lymph nodes but wants to know what is the typically length of the event. Patient also experienced other side effects, on 30Dec2020 (last week), she developed vertigo that lasted through the weekend intermittently, states she at first thought she was having a stroke. States it seems to have subsided as of 05Jan2021 (yesterday). Patient also reported she had an itchy rash twice as part of her side effects reported from the COVID 19 vaccine. She noticed an itchy rash and it went away but she is unsure exactly the day or time. Stated she definitely remembered the rash on 28Dec2020 as she took pictures. It was gone in about three hours on the same day. She did not treat the rash because it was gone and not itching. The rash came and went and had not come back. It was mostly on the bends of the arms, bilateral arms. Patient reported developing swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area the day after the injection, on 24Dec2020. They were not as tender at the time of the report but were continuing and this was 15 days from her vaccination. Patient also experienced an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms that occurred twice and only lasted a few hours each time, onset date reported as 25Dec2020. She was advised to take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for it however she did not take it. On 23Dec2020 patient experienced headache. On 24Dec2020 patient experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes and runny nose. On 30Dec2020 patient experienced joint pain and muscle and vertigo. The events headache, experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, runny nose, joint pain and muscle and an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms were considered serious as medically significant events. Patient had not recovered from swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, joint pain and muscle, extreme fatigue and swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area, she was recovering from headache, runny nose and vertigo and recovered completely from an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Causality between the events, headache, experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, runny nose, joint pain and muscle and an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms, and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine cannot be denied based on the reasonable temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

The sensation was very intense it felt like my whole body was being paralyzed. I was fading out because of high heart rate. My heart rate was 160 and I heard someone said my blood pressure was high. I was transferred to the ER and given epinephrine, anti-histamine, steroids.

Took 50mg of Benadryl PO and went to the ED, about a 15 minute car ride. Had tingling and numbness of the tongue and back of throat by arrival but still able to breath with focus. Exertion of just walking into the ED greatly increased the SOB. Was triaged, Benadryl starting to help, was able to speak a little better, 3-4 words without too much SOB caused. Was walked to a room, SOB milder with that exertion. Seen by Dr. Given IV Sol-u-Medrol and 50mg Benadryl. Was observed on cardiac monitor/Q15VS for a few hours and discharged home around 5:30. Given Rx of Prednisone 20mg -3tabs x2 days, 2tabs x5 days all once a days and told to take 50mg of Benadryl Q4H for the next 24 hours at least and to return prn.   I did need to stay on Benadryl, as the Sol-u-Medrol wore off some of the swelling in thr throat did return but not severe, Benadryl did help, along with taking my Asthmnex I already had. I also continued my normal HS antihistamines.  I had SOB on exertion, progressively better from the 6th-10th with it mostly resolved to yesterday. Body aches have continued but also progressively better.  Yeasterday1/12/21 the Rx of prednisone was completed and I did have some mild swelling /tingling in the throat/face/mouth return in the evening, took Benadryl 50mg again and inhaler used. I have an appointment today to seek further care at my primary doctor&#39;s office.  Asthmnax used again this morning as well, only mild tightness in the throat currently with mild body aches this whole time.

Overnight, I started to experience chills followed by extreme perspiration and weakness to the point that I struggled to open a bottle of water I had by my bed.  Tuesday, 1/12/2021:                       Headache, weak and tired but attempted to work.  I had to leave shortly after arriving because my symptoms were becoming progressively worse to the point I almost passed out from standing.  Upon arriving home, I started to experience nausea and vomiting x 3. Intense chills followed by the extreme perspiration still existed.  Most of these symptoms subsided by 9:30p that evening.  Wednesday, 1/13/2021:                Intense headache, weakness and dizziness.  Of note, my left underarm/armpit (the arm where the vaccine was administered) is sensitive to touch.

Day 2 those effects went away low grade fever, aches, but had a knot axillary lymph node, and my arm hurt worse then the swelling spread to my chest and neck. No trouble breathing.

This 42-year-old female nurse (patient) reported for herself that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot#: nurse stated she thought she had a lot# it looked like EK5703), via unspecified route at right deltoid on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure (patient had taken blood pressure medicine but hadn&#39;t taking currently because her blood pressure was being controlled). Concomitant medications included unspecified vitamins. Patient was tested positive for Covid on the 29Dec2020. She stated she didn&#39;t know about causality, she was saying no but she did have swollen lymph nodes under the right arm before getting sick (Dec2020), now she thought that might get from her vaccination but in her understanding she could get it from Covid so, she couldn&#39;t answer that, she tested positive, she didn&#39;t think it&#39;s from vaccination but her concern was because she had got the vaccination the first one then had the (Covid) infection and right now she should get the second one or not. Regarding treatment, patient stated she was taking methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL) and salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler, taking over the counter Vitamin D3, Zinc and Vitamin C and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN). Patient reported she did go to the physician office/ emergency room. Outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (8 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between events &#34;Tested positive for Covid/had the (Covid) infection&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / COVID-19) and  swollen lymph nodes and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I have no pre existing conditions before taking the vaccine . Last year my platelet count was 166.  After 1 week of taking the second shot of vaccine my platelet count dropped to 129.  After 5 days later I had reexamined the cbc and the platelet dropped to  121. I believe it is a reaction to the vaccine.

A 42-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL1284/expiration date), dose number 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient previously took nitroglycerin and experienced drug allergy. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (lot number EL0140, dose number 1) for immunization on 22Dec2020 after which the patient experienced mild headache. Concomitant medications were not reported. There were no other vaccines received within 4 weeks. The patient had no adverse reaction other than mild headache after the first dose, so she was very relaxed and she felt comfortable getting the 2nd dose. However, after 10 minutes after the second dose, her heart started to race and she started to feel a tingling sensation from her left arm that radiated to all over her body to the point where she felt paralyzed. Her heart rate jumped to 160 and her blood pressure went up. She couldn&#39;t even open her eyes nor speak a word. She was transported to the ER and was given steroids and anti-histamine. She refused to get an epinephrine shot at first, but she started to feel choking sensation on her neck so she asked for an epi shot. The patient had not been tested for COVID post-vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events heart racing, tingling sensation, paralyzed, heart rate high, blood pressure increased and chocking sensation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

No other vaccine in four weeks. No covid prior vaccination. Unknown if covid tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient has not received any other vaccines around the time of bnt162b2 vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included heart rate with result of went up as soon as epipen was administered, O2 saturation and vitals with unknown results, all on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylactic reaction with throat closing up and being unable to breathe or talk.

This 42-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN9581) on 02Feb2021 at 10:30, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. The first BNT162B2 vaccine dose was administered on 12Jan2021 at 13:30, lot number EL3246, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart murmur, acute sinusitis, allergies to acetaminophen/oxycodone (PERCOCET), cephalexin (KEFLEX), codeine, trees, pollen, grass, mold, cats, some dogs. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and COVID was not tested after vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the second vaccine dose on 02Feb2021 at the hospital and was monitored for 30 minutes. Within that time her tongue started to be tingly, she experienced fuzzy feeling, tongue swollen a bit with hives, hard to swallow, weird taste in mouth. The nurse on staff walked her to the ED, she was admitted and treated for allergic reaction to the vaccine and received prednisone for 5 days and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). Epipen if needed. Later that night, on 02Feb2021, the patient had a high grade fever over 103, chills uncontrollably, heart racing a bit, could not lift arm/move body, joint-muscle pain, headache, dizziness, swollen lymphnodes, hard to swallow, every side effect on sheet just really bad. Her fever eventually went down on 03Feb2021 to 102, 101, 99, then 98.6. She still had all other symptoms not as severe, later that night she had a bit of a red rash on chest/arms/stomach with some hives, swallowing was still a bit hard. She continued to take BENADRYL and steroid. 06Feb2021 was her last day of steroid. As of 06Feb2021 she was feeling a bit better with no fever, swallowing a bit hard but other symptoms were less. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Fever resolved on an unspecified date in Feb2021. The other events were resolving.

                                                Two days after the 2nd injection I started to have chest pain and not feel right. I went to the Station where I volunteer. I did and EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I went to the ER. They gave me 4 baby aspirin to take and some blood work. I was told the blood work showed elevated levels consistent with a blood clot as well. I had a CT scan to rule out a clot in my heart or lungs. Which it was negative. I was released and told to see a cardiologist in the next few days. I saw the cardiologist two days later who said I ended up with Pericarditis and that it should resolve on its own. I was feeling better until two days ago when I developed chest pain again. I again went to my fire station I volunteer for and did an EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I am currently waiting for treatment from my cardiologist.

I saw the cardiologist who believed it to be sinus tackycardia as a result as an AE to  vaccine.  Felt as if my face and lips were swelling  so I took benedry and laid down again and the next morning  when I woke up and my face and lips were super swollen.  But by the 3rd day the symptoms began to subside a little.  By the 24th my HR had balanced out and I only had residual swelling around the eye area.

A 43-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) lot no: EK9231, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 30Dec2020 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history HTN and exercise-induced asthma, both from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination and was not covid tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), and biotin. No other vaccines were administered in four weeks. Known allergies include tapendalol (NUCYNTA) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (BACTRIM). On 30Dec2020 09:30, the patient experienced itching and redness over whole body, elevated heart rate, and blood pressure. The patient was given IV diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) 50 mg, IV famotidine (PEPCID), IV methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL), &#34;flui&#34; as treatment for AEs. The patient further clarified that she received the COVID 19 vaccine on 30Dec2020 at 9:00 and she had an allergic reaction. She turned all red and was itching all over her body by about 10:30- 10:45 am and was at the ER by about 11am. She started on prednisone 40mg for 3 days and diphenhydramine every 6 hours, as needed on 30Dec2020. On Sunday (03Jan2021), she was still severely itching and turning red so prednisone was continued for an additional 3 days and was switched to cetirizine (ZYRTEC) because she can&#39;t function on diphenhydramine. Cetirizine was not helping so she had to take diphenhydramine yesterday morning (04Jan2021). Last night (04Jan2021), she was ok without any diphenhydramine but this morning (05Jan2021), she still have mild itching, and no redness. The redness comes and goes; it is on the face, chest, arms, legs. When it first started, it was whole body redness. Then it moved to different areas on different days; she don&#39;t have a rash or hives, just redness.  She had a 4 inch band of redness on both arms one day. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient had not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of allergic reactions cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of drug allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of allergic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

                                                increased new palpitations/an increase in the amount of chest palpitations; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 43-year-old female patient receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number EH9899), intramuscular on the left deltoid on 29Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE as COVID prevention at the hospital.  Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism for about 3 or 4 years, sinus headache, and ear pressure. It was reported that the patient had palpitations in the past but has not had any recently. Concomitant medications included ongoing liothyronine sodium (CYTOMEL) for hypothyroidism and phenylephrine (PHENYLEPHRINE) from unknown date until 31Dec2020 for ear pressure and sinus headache. The patient had her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 29Dec2020 and she had no problems at first, but she stated that she was seeing an increase in the amount of chest palpitations that she was having since 31Dec2020. She knew it was cold and fly season (uncommon for her to have ear pressure and headaches with weather changes) and she had to take some sinus medicines, so she just blew the palpitations off as having come from those sinus medicines but she was no longer taking those medicines and the palpitations were still persisting. The patient also mentioned that she was watching her caffeine intake, and she even was not having any more caffeine than she normally does. She really noticed the palpitations over the holiday weekend, and it felt like it was getting worse, and then she started feeling like she needed to reset herself. Outcome of the event was not recovered. As per causality, the patient also mentioned that it was unknown if the palpitations were caused by the vaccine, but she feared that they were. She also mentioned that she had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID Vaccine so she was not sure.

I received first dose on 12/23/2020 and second dose on  1/10/2021.  Since vaccine I?ve noticed my reflux has been flared.  I haven?t had to take Protonix in months; however, I really started to experience indigestion and chest burning/pressure a week after first dose.  I started back taking Protonix and had to increase dose to twice a day on 1/5/2021.  Symptoms have improved significantly but it?s still somewhat aggravated. I also experienced lower back pain and upper and lower extremities numbness/tingling maybe 2-3 time since first vaccine

No fever.  No visual changes but the light does bother her eyes.  She does have a history of migraine headaches that are like this at times.  The pain is in her forehead, not globally or in her neck.  She has no neck pain or stiffness.  She did not have much of reaction after her first vaccination.  She does have a history of hypertension but has been taken off her medication because her blood pressures have been well controlled.  She states that she does check them regularly at home and they have been okay.  She denies any other recent sick symptoms.  No other significant chronic underlying medical problems.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: Negative and Pixel: Negative on 08Jan2021. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events including stroke, dizzy/lightheaded/felt like fainting, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and sudden loss of hearing to right, and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2. More information regarding the patient&#39;s underlying medical conditions, relevant lab tests would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

                                                Started itching within (left arm) 15 minutes. THey said I was fine and to go back to work. About an hour later, I started breaking out in hives and whole body itching. I went back in and they gave me to full strength Benadryl and it was not helping and my BP was 190/140 (stroke level) and they tried to bring that down. About 10:15 my face was starting to swell and I was short of breath and 10:30 they took me to ER - and gave me Cortisol shot. And IV fluids. And I was in ER for two hours. They wrote me a prescription for six days for 2 prednisone for every day for one week. The PA saw me at the ER and he prescribed. I went home but couldn&#39;t drive home because I couldn&#39;t see straight so got a ride home. They tested my O2 levels before they left me. Oxygen was 96. My blood pressure was down to 140/95 - so it was down but still elevated. I still had facial swelling for 3 days. But after three or four days it resolved the face swelling. Had a weakness from the shot and still itching but nothing like it was that day still after the four days.  Dr. told me I couldn&#39;t get second dose. It was an anaphalactic reaction. Dr - prescribed me an EpiPen in case I have another bad reaction to anything.

A 43-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical Vaccine included received first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization and her arm was inflamed, and so swollen, she couldn&#39;t move it. Caller was instructed to call after getting the COVID vaccine. She had a reaction after the vaccine. Her doctor said to call Pfizer. It was after she received the 2nd dose of the vaccine, Saturday (09Jan2021). She had a reaction. She developed a headache and fatigue. She had had these side effects since Saturday. They have lasted Sunday, Monday, and today/Tuesday. She was very tired, and she has generalized body pain. The pain was in her arm, shoulders, knees, spines, scapula&#39;s, hips, hands, legs, feet, and back. Literally, her whole body was so painful. She had been taken Ibuprofen 800mg and Tylenol 1g. She had been taking those every 8 hours. She took them together. When she took them, her headache and body pain was maybe a 5-6/10. If she didn&#39;t take the Ibuprofen and Tylenol her body pain and headache was probably an 8/10 pain. She also had swollen lymph nodes in her left arm pit. Which is the arm they injected the vaccine into. She just noticed it Saturday night. She couldn&#39;t move her arm. Now, after the second, she had a swollen lymph node the size of a quarter. It had been the same size since Saturday. She was wondering if it would go away? She was also becoming forgetful. Her brain was foggy-ongoing. Like she forgot her doctors appointment today. The outcome of event &#34;brain was foggy&#34; was not resolved while outcome of other events were unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received my first vaccine on Dec 18. By Dec 25, I had already started with rapid weight loss and a feeling of increased energy/metabolism with  a fast heart rate.  Over the next week, the symptoms escalated and my heartrate was consistently in the range of 95-125. I was losing 2lbs a day without any change in my diet.  I lost 12lbs over 2 weeks as I tried to compensate and eat more.  I had my thyroid checked with the concern of possible thyroiditis,  but my TSH was well within normal limits.  My FT3 was on the high end of normal but still within normal limits.   Over this time frame, I am also having significant difficulty sleeping and only sleep for 3-5 hours most days.    After my second vaccine on Jan 10th, my heartrate and weightloss stabilized and consistently still experiencing a heartrate around 100.  I usually weigh around 120 lbs &#43;/- 2 pounds and my weight is now consistently 110 &#43;/- 2 lbs.    I am an ER doctor, just for background reference of my medical knowledge.  I had the nurse do an ECG on me at work and there were no concerning disruptions in the electrical conduction system of the heart.  My blood pressure has been normal throughout, and sometimes rather high up to 160/110.  My usual vital signs are BP 110/60 and HR 60-70.

A 43 years old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EL3248, Expiration Date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 at 13:22 at single dose on right arm for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included vasovagal (she did have a history of vasovagal. She talked to her doctor about this prior to the vaccine. At first when she had it her previous doctor felt a little confused. She was unsure if it was vasovagal or a blood clot in her lungs. She did get it checked out with a cat scan and there was no clot. They had to have tested her for anaphylaxis at that time. It was not a clear diagnose. Then she saw a cardiologist. She was diagnosed with vasovagal at that time. It lasted only a few months and she was fully recovered). Concomitant medications included ongoing ergocalciferol (VIT D) and ongoing vitamins NOS (MULTIVITAMIN). Patient received the vaccine on Tuesday, 12Jan2021. Her appointment was at 12:54, but she got the vaccine at 13:22. She was looking at her phone to re-schedule her second dose. She felt totally fine. At 13:27 she had this weird very hot rush down her right arm that was vaccinated and went up the back of her neck only on the right side. She looked up from her phone and was very dizzy. She stood up and as she did her heart started to race. It was a really weird feeling that she has never felt. She was a little out of it. She had no trouble breathing. Within 30 seconds she was completely fine. She did feel a little out of it, as it produced a little bit of anxiety. She had no other symptoms. She stayed at the facility for 30 minutes. As she was leaving one person asked how she felt and she was told to let the EMTs know. She let them know what happened. One woman working there said it could have been an anxiety attack. She did not have a lot of anxiety but she did have some. It did not feel like that. She had never had the warm sensations or heart racing. She was totally fine when talking to the EMTs. They did not seem concerned and they let her schedule her second shot. She read on Pfizer about allergic reactions. She was assuming this was what happened. A mild allergic reaction. She had no breathing issues or hives. Her arm was very sore- it was difficult to lift it. She had also never had this type of soreness with vaccines. Dizziness: She has had the dizziness a couple of times. Twice now. One when she had gotten home. It was very mild and nothing compared to what she had when she got the vaccine. Then another last night at bedtime. It was a woosh of dizziness.  Arm soreness: very improved now. felt like she would normally have after getting a vaccine. The first day was intense but after a few hours was less. The next day she woke up and it was pretty much gone. She still had a little but it has mostly improved. Caller stated she would still like to get the second dose but she was a little nervous. She had it maybe once or twice since then and it has been mild with no extreme pressure drops. They thought maybe it was a virus that affected her. Her reaction to the vaccine was different. The difference was pretty significant. Vasovagal felt like her heart will stop and she will pass out. After the vaccine she felt dizzy but didn&#39;t feel faint, and had a racing heart. Nobody seemed concerned about her reaction and getting the second dose. But she read that Pfizer does not recommend getting the second dose even if you had a mild reaction. She was wondering what she should do. Her second dose is scheduled for 02Feb2021. Outcome of hot sensation/weird very hot rush down her right arm that was vaccinated and went up the back of her neck only on the right side and heart racing was resolved on 12Jan2021, dizzy was resolved on 13Jan2021, outcome of anxiety was unknown, outcome of her arm was very sore- it was difficult to lift it  and a mild allergic reaction was resolving.

I was diagnosed with COVID on 12/28/20, but was first symptomatic on 12/24. I attributed my s/s initially to the vaccine. I was eventually tested on 12/28/20, as my symptoms worsened and I was positive for COVID.  On 1/14/21 I received my second dose, my COVID s/s had been resolved since 1/4/21. On the evening of 1/18/21 I started experiencing mild abdominal pain. This progressed, on the evening 1/20 the pain was no longer tolerable. I went to the ER where I hemorrhaged and needed emergency surgery and a blood transfusion for a miscarriage. The surgery ultimately took place in the early morning hours of 1/22/21, followed by the blood transfusion.

I gave myself my epi-pen. I notified them and they took me to ER - IV - Benadryl and Solumedrol . I got really shaky for about an hour afterwards and then they discharged me. It cleared up my throat issues. within 4 days, I had significant shortness of breath again and I was directed to ER Gave me evaluated me for a pulmonary embolism - I did not have one. They gave me Solumedrol again. They gave me a prednisone taper. And then a week after that - or two weeks after - the shortness of breath returned  - Dr had me go to ER room again - They gave me another prednisone taper which I&#39;m still on and I have significant fatigue still and 24/7 out of breath still. Currently: Flonase 50 mg - twice a day - Admerdiscus 100 mg  - twice a day

This 43-year-old female patient female received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EM9810, intramuscular on left deltoid on 04Feb2021 as single dose (at the age of 43 years) for Covid-19 Immunization.  No medical history reported, and no concomitant medication reported.  Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 for Covid-19 Immunization.  Medical history included Pacemaker in Jun2019 and ongoing, sick sinus syndrome, and pre-existing cardiac arrhythmia ongoing.  Historical vaccine included Tetanus, Tetanus made her arm sore, the soreness from tetanus was worse than the soreness from COVID vaccine since it lasted a week with tetanus, no lot number reported.    No concomitant medication was reported. The patient experienced she already has a pre-existing cardiac arrhythmia, but it seemed to have gotten worse after receiving the 1st dose/More arrhythmia problems on 05Feb2021 considered medically significant with outcome of not recovered, Within 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine she felt like she was going to pass out three times on 04Feb2021 considered medically significant and recovered on 04Feb2021, she may have been panicked on unspecified date with outcome of unknown, left arm soreness on 05Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on Feb2021, and she felt ugh, like she was getting sick on 05Feb2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient did not receive treatment for events.  She stayed an extra 30 minutes to be monitored after the initial waiting of 15 minutes since she had to drive home, then she felt better. She has not called her cardiologist since she has the history of arrhythmias.  She had the more arrhythmias start on the evening of the 05Feb2021, states it was weird because it seems to happen more in the evening between 6 and 9pm, sometimes as late as 10pm. However, &#39;yesterday&#39; it started happening during the day, and it is more frequent, not constant, it just happens. States it is hard not think about it when her heart is having hiccups since that is what it feels like. She knows what it feels like because when her pacemaker goes off ventricularly she can feel it. She had arrhythmias before the vaccine but has not had issues with arrhythmias continuously. She was diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome and they do not know if it is cardiology or neurology, states it has been an issue for her for the last two years (2019). Lab data included weight of 284-286.  She is asking if there is any data that supports her getting the second dose on 25Feb2021. She has read that some people tend to have more side effects with the second dose. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on vaccine-event chronological association, a causal relationship between events worsening arrhythmia and pre-syncope and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

                                                heart rate jumped up; thought she was going to pass out; eyes were blurry; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 43-year-old female consumer received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at single dose via an unspecified route of administration on left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Relevant medical history included autoimmune issues diagnosed in 2006-2007. Concomitant medications were not reported. After 4 days from vaccination on 14Feb2021 the patient experienced blurred vision, increased heart rate, and feeling that she will pass out (as such) . She went to the Emergency Room and they did two EKGs, two COVID tests, and blood work to check the enzymes in her blood for her cardiac muscle, but there was no reason, nothing they could find about why her heart rate spiked. Patient also reported that her heart rate went up from about 03:00PM up thru midnight last night, and was still not down completely, it was a little erratic, but it was better than it was. She was prescribed treatment at the hospital to bring her heart rate down, but they didn&#39;t want to give her more and risk lowering her blood pressure. Patient was monitored through the night, and she was supposed to see a cardiologist there but they didn&#39;t show up, so she put a phone call in to hers. She was admitted to the hospital overnight. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date.

                                                Starting on February 24, 2021, I started to have shortness of breath. This slowly got worse until on March 2, 2021 I was unable to breathe in all the way and was getting a sharp pain in my side/back when I tried to breathe in more than half way. I then went to the emergency room recognizing the symptom as likely being a pulmonary embolism, as I had experienced one four years earlier. It was, in fact, a PE. I was in the hospital for five days as they treated the clots with blood thinners. I slowly got my breathing more back to normal and was discharged. They are still runnying myriad tests to try to determine the cause or causes, but I thought it wise to report here in case the vaccine is a factor. I received my second dose on 2/26/21, a few days before I went to the hospital but my symptoms started a few days before that.

                                                Driving home 18-20 mins post injection, my heart started racing, my hands were shaking, it became hard to breathe, my fingers were tingling and my mouth got very dry. I pulled over and called 911. The paramedics stated my BP was within normal limits of around 140/80. My normal is closer to 90/65. Once symptoms resolved I attempted to drive home. Once again, the same symptoms returned. I pulled over. I then made my way to a safe location and waited for family to come. Since the event I have had times of mild labored breathing while walking. While driving I become very anxious and the feelings of an anxiety attack return. I saw my nurse practitioner 2 days ago who referred to the driving anxiety as a form of PTSD and prescribed Prozac and Xanax. I have not take the Xanax, but have taken two nighttime doses of Prozac. Yesterday, I did not feel as though I had taken medication. My drive to work was uneventful. My drive home involved tightening of the chest, labored breathing and anxiety. This morning I cannot tell if I am feeling the vaccine or Prozac in my system, but I feel off. Swimmy headed, watery mouth, heaviness in my arms and shoulders. I need guidance on taking the 2nd vaccine or if I should seek further medical treatment. I have added a vit B vitamin a day to my regimen since the date of the vaccine.

I got tested for Covid on 12-27-2020 and was positive. I also had diarrhea and nausea.  I did telemedicine with my primary healthcare doctor and I discussed with him that I felt tightness with pressure sensation to my chest and he said that it was cause of my asthma and he told me to take prednisone medication.

                                                Patient was extremely anxious prior to vaccine.  She told me she did get seizures but she took medication for it and I informed her that it would still be recommended to get the vaccine.  She was visibly anxious even after vaccine.  Immediately after she began crying to her friend and said she &#34;was just SO afraid of needles&#34;.  I told her to take some deep breaths and after a minute or two she went to the observation room.  Approximately 15 minutes later she rushed back into the room looking like she might hyperventilate or have hypoglycemia (shaking, cold sweats).  She sat down and I tried to calm her down.  I asked someone to get her orange juice.  During the next couple minutes she did not seem to be getting any better and started shaking.  I requested someone call 911.  Another staff was helping so I moved to get and administer an epi-pen injection.  By this time the patient was not responsive, but was still breathing.  I instructed staff to help move her to the floor for monitoring and if needed, cpr.  She regain partial consciousness.  Her breath and pulse were always present, so there was no need to begin cpr.  After a few minutes EMT arrived and transported patient to local hospital.  During all of this, other employees at the facility were attempting to contact family members, which they were eventually able to do. About 30 minutes later the staff informed me they had spoken to family members who were at the hospital and that she was improving, but they had not seen her yet.

I developed left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on 12/25 and that is still present and unchanged.  I reported that prior.   I developed a rash similar to pityriasis rosea on 1/11.  This is progressive and still present.  I do currently also have fatigue and possible conjunctivitis.

                                                2nd shot: Very different experience. Got the shot in my left arm after work like before. I had a headache and felt tired so took some melatonin, had a hot toddy, and went to bed early. Woke up roughly 18 hours post vaccine with back aches and lower rib pain when I took a breath. Took my temp, it was 100*.  By 21 hours I had a temp of 102*.  My groin, neck, and left arm pit lymph nodes were enlarged as well. After sleeping most of the day away, it felt like my fever &#39;broke&#39; at 28 hours, it came down to 101*.  Finally I took some Tylenol at 34 hours so I could sleep from the back pain.  Woke up the next morning at 45 hours with a stiff back/neck but temp down to 99*.  I also had a swollen and reddened entire deltoid where the shot had been given (painless when shot given and no blood after), almost like a cellulitis or allergic reaction.  My left armpit lymph node remains enlarged but not as painful. Now almost 72 hours out, the only residual effects are a decreasing but enlarged left armpit lymph node, improving swollen/reddened deltoid, decreased appetite, and decreased energy level.

A 44-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot ek9231) on 08Jan2021 03.00 pm intramuscular in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included RA, spondylitis, GERD, known allergies to sulfa, penicillin, cefalexin monohydrate (KEFLEX), sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIM), adalimumab (HUMIRA), ankylosis. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), omeprazole, loratadine (CLARITIN) and infliximab (RENFLEXIS). First dose of BNT162B2 was administered on 21Dec2020 11:00 am (lot ek5730) intramuscular in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Approx 34 hours after vaccine (also reported as 03Jan2021) awoke unable to breath. Symptoms consistent with laryngospasm, symptoms lasted approx 2 minutes. No treatment provided. No COVID test performed prior or after vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of unable to breath/ Laryngospasm cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of allergic reaction to vaccine.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 44-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0140), intramuscularly on the arm on 19Dec2020 11:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tachycardia and stroke from 2019 and diabetes mellitus diagnosed in summer of 2020 and ongoing. Family medical history included father had type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medication included metformin hydrochloride, sitagliptin (JANUMET) for diabetes. The patient previously took regular flu shot and had body aches; it did not happen at the year of report but in years past she did have it. The patient took the COVID vaccine for precaution as she was a healthcare worker/paramedic and stated there was no prescriber. She received the vaccination at a health department facility, not a military facility. She had no previous immunizations and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date as COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Dec2020 and after nine days, she tested positive for COVID-19 on 30Dec2020 and had an inpatient hospital stay. She mentioned she was so happy that she did not have any symptoms for those days. She stated that she got the shot on the 19th and later that evening was when she started having symptoms. She tried to sleep and it woke her up, she felt sleepy, tired and experienced headache on 19Dec2020 20:00 to 21:00. On 28Dec2020 23:00, she had an increased cough. She initially had increased cough from wearing mask and was having post nasal drip, then she got wet cough and that was when she decided to get tested. She went back and forth on dates; stated she was confused with the dates because of being in the hospital, it had been a while and the dates were all meshing in together. Her specimen was collected and they did the test on 29Dec2020 then found out that she tested positive for COVID virus with a COVID test nasal swab on 30Dec2020 17:30. She mentioned she lost weight after she got COVID, had no sense of taste or smell on unspecified dates. She did not know if it was related to her thyroid but she started losing hair and her heart rate started increasing on Monday, so they took her off all her meds and said the COVID was doing crazy things to the body. She had to go on Carvedilol for the sinus tachycardia and had high blood pressure now. This was all new after she tested positive. She has had bouts of tachycardia before and did have a heart monitor as she had a stroke last year. So those have never been persistent or symptomatic. If she did have a high heart rate, it always went down. This one was symptomatic. She did fine the whole week after the shot, just had that little bit of sleepiness, was tired, and had a headache. The patient reported near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism on 08Jan2021 14:30 to 15:00, which required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 10Jan2021 (2 days). ER or physician&#39;s office was required. She never went to the ER for the vaccination, it was just for the near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism that she went and was then admitted to hospital. She just got out of the hospital the day before report (10Jan2021), was there for two days and was still recovering. She was supposed to receive her second vaccination on the day of report however her doctor did not know if she should get the second dose due to double antibodies. She did not ask if she still had the virus or it went away. She has not been to work in two weeks. Outcome of the events tested positive for COVID virus was not recovered; near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism was recovered with sequel; sleepy, tired and headache was recovering; while the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

I had pain in the wrist arm, joints and fingers. I determined it was due to the swelling.  I had some lymph node enlargement, and was really fatigue and slept most of the day. (36 hours).  I did not have a fever.  I&#39;m a doctor and did some evaluations  on myself. I didn&#39;t have trouble breathing of swallowing.  If I wasn&#39;t medically trained I would have gone into the doctor.  I did see an ENT for hearing test to make sure there was no damage and there was not.

A 44-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# ELI283), via an unspecified route of administration single dose on 12Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation. First dose was received on 22Dec2020 10:00 left arm (lot# EJI695). Medical history included chronic skin condition. No other vaccine was received in four weeks.  Concomitant medications included oxycodone for pain, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D). The patient experienced myocardial infarction on 10Feb2021 20:00, very high troponin levels (4.79 &amp; 12.49) on 11Feb2021, repeat episodes of chest pain on 10Feb2021 20:00, heart attack on 10Feb2021 20:00, thrombus formation on 10Feb2021 20:00, coagulopathy on 10Feb2021 20:00. The patient was hospitalized due to the events from 11Feb2021. Patient reported to be a healthy 44 year old woman with no history of hypertension or high cholesterol. She was now on 7 different medications to protect her heart, including blood thinners and antihypertensives that result in daily headaches and fatigue. She had had several repeat episodes of chest pain which has required taking sublingual nitroglycerin. She was off work for an undetermined amount of time. Her primary care physician was baffled by her case and reached out to a number of experts who have agreed that her heart attack was caused by a thrombus formation/coagulopathy most definitely related to the Covid vaccines she received.  The events outcome was recovered with sequelae.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  myocardial infarction and other events. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this 44-years-old patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.

This 44-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: E19266) via intramuscular at single dose on 20Feb2021 09:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was on 30Jan2021 in left arm. Medical history included splenectomy from Feb2017; pancreatic surgery from Feb2017, they removed her spleen as part of that; soy allergy; poultry allergy. Patient confirmed she had splenectomy. The surgery was sort of emergency based so knowing most likely they were taking her spleen out; she was given 4 vaccinations. In the hospital, she did break out in what appeared to be like a chicken pox type rash. The rash lasted a month and then it started to fade. She did not have any breathing sort of symptoms. The doctors did attribute the rash to one of the vaccinations, she was not clear on what vaccine caused the reaction. Ideally, she was supposed to have 2 weeks prior to the surgery so her body had time to reabsorb but she did not have that kind of time, but she had nothing internally going on. She confirmed she had no names, NDC, Lot number or expiration dates for the vaccines she received at that point in time. Having the splenectomy was the biggest thing. In the past, she did not have any allergies to medications, but did have allergies to soy and poultry. She did break out from certain food and her skin develops those blotches. She did have an extra work up in Feb2020, where they tested a bunch of food sensitivities and allergies, and nothing came back. This was right before COVID hit so she did not really follow back up after that, but she was tested for all major foods and household things and nothing came up. In her late 20&#39;s, she definitely tested for a soy allergy and allergy to poultry. She did check off yes, she had a reaction previously when she was filling out the form at the COVID-19 vaccine site knowing that she had this prior experience. She was held 30 minutes each time for that reason. Concomitant medication was none. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was no. On 20Feb2021, patient was very faint, thought she was going to pass out, eyes were watering, blotches on her neck and chest, tingly experience on her tongue and lips, severely shaking, overwhelming chills, extreme nausea. On an unspecified date, patient experienced headache, general weakness, in her legs especially, no energy, no appetite, chills that come and go, diarrhea and green colored stools. Patient received her second shot of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on 20Feb2021. She had had symptoms ever since. She had a reaction on site at the vaccine center. She eventually had to go to the Emergency Room by ambulance. Her symptoms were still going on and tomorrow would mark a week since she received the second dose. The symptoms she experienced on site were different than what she was currently experiencing. She felt like she had a true reaction at the vaccine facility site. Within 6 minutes of receiving the second vaccine, she became very faint, her eyes were watering. She thought she was going to pass out for a bit. She was told she had blotches on her neck and chest. She had a tingly experience on her tongue and lips. She was severely shaking and had overwhelming chills. She stated this happened for a couple of hours. Basically, there were 3 waves of these symptoms kind of happening. The third wave happened probably a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. At that point, she had been given two pills of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), taken orally. With the third wave, she thought she was going to pass out, which she thought multiple times before, but then with this particular wave, she experienced extreme nausea which was kind of a new symptom. The doctor on site said to the EMT that he wanted her to go to the Emergency Room. Patient confirmed she was taken to the ER via ambulance the day she received the vaccine, 20Feb2021. She was never admitted into the hospital; she was only seen in the Emergency Room for a couple of hours. She was given IV fluids, she had blood work done. She didn&#39;t have a copy of her labs but she was told they were okay. She was injected with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) via IV before she was released. A lot more symptoms came after she was released from the hospital (ER). She came home and she had just a crazy headache that she really woke up with every single day until this morning. She had been taking a lot of caffeine/paracetamol (EXCEDRIN, Lot#: H044G, Expiry Date: Jun2022) for her headaches. She experienced extreme weakness, nausea. She clarified she had weakness in her legs. She had this exhaustion, and she felt this general weakness sort of in her legs especially. She was still taking stuff for a headache, and she was taking nausea pills. She had been out of work all week. She had no energy, no appetite really. She had chills that come and go. She had diarrhea. She clarified she had more diarrhea in the beginning days after receiving the vaccine, but it was always been a green colored stool as well. The ER called and checked in and were very surprised she had been having the symptoms still so severely. They wanted her to go get an actual COVID test. She went to the Urgent Care to get COVID tested on 23Feb2021 and had a rapid and PCR test. The rapid test came back negative. She had not received the results for the PCR test yet. She was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride but she stopped taking that. The hospital directed her stop taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride earlier in the week. She clarified she was taking a generic version (Lot#: P113966, Expiry Date: Feb2021), coated mini tablets. She clarified the nausea pills she had been taking was the generic for ZOFRAN, ondansetron 4 mg tablet, by mouth, every 8 hours. She confirmed this product was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date on it. She clarified she also had been taking the generic version of TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH, it was the Up and Up Brand acetaminophen (Lot#: P122699, Expiry Date: Nov2022) gel caps, 500mg. COVID-19 rapid test was negative on 23Feb2021; COVID-19 PCR test on 23Feb2021 was unknown results. Patient asked if there was a hotline she can call or an information number where she can talk to somebody about her symptoms. She also reported this to her doctor but the doctor made it clear since it was a private practice, they had limited information. The doctor did take down similar information, she just did not know if there was any further information or a hotline she could call. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Around 6pm I started with a slight headache and by 8pm i had trouble keeping my eyes open.  (headache is not uncommon for me but the extreme drowsiness is).   I slept solid through the night (unusual) and the puppy woke me around 5am. (ususal)  I felt that i had a heavy? head.  My thoughts seemed clear but my head had a fullness to it.  Its difficult to describe.  I was not stuffy.  I had trouble staying awake, to the point I was nodding off at times I should have been able to stay awake.  I did not feel safe to work and felt obligated to call in.  I slept solidly for the next 5 hours.  Later in the day, my affected arm began to have pain radiate from the injection site to my wrist.  (probably not unusual).  600mg of Ibuprofen did not seem to help much.  By the time I went to bed last night (24&#43; hrs after receiving the vaccine) I noticed my axillary nymph nodes were extremely tender to the touch and remain so this morning.  The pain in my arm still continues to radiate to my wrist but not as intense.

Pharmacist then delivered vaccine. Almost immediately after administration, the patient started showing signs of distress including difficulty speaking, and going in an out of consciousness. Ice packs were placed on the back of patient&#39;s neck, and she was given water in order to hopes to stimulate  consciousness. At this time, the pharmacist placed a pulse oximeter on her finger to monitor.  Her oxygen stats dropped  to 75%  and heart rate dropped to a value slightly greater to slightly under 30 beats per minute as indicated by the pulse ox blinking at 30.  Pharmacist timed the period of bradycardia, after 60 seconds an epinephrine pen 0.3mg was administered to the left lateral thigh. Rapid response code was called and team came 1.5 - 2 minutes after epinephrine administration. Oxygen was given to the patient at the scene where her recorded blood pressure was 94/54 mmHg. She was then transported into the emergency department via wheelchair. Patient stabilized and was discharged back to work approximately an hour after arrival.

                                                On 12-16-2020 I received my first Pfizer injection and 5 days after I experienced lymphadenopathy to my neck, left arm and under the arm and clavicle. My lymph nodes are swelling and I am concerned since I never had my lymph nodes swell up. On my second injection 01-06-2021, I continue with lymph node swelling and my symptoms do not seem to go away. I went to see my doctor, that said  it was probably a reaction to the Pfizer injection and he is recommending that in February 2021,  if I still have swelling to my lymph nodes then lab work will be performed.

Then around 1030 she started to have lower chest (near the lower ribs) pain 9/10 pain and she was diaphoretic. We called 911 as we were concerned about an MI. She was transported via EMS to the hospital. They ran various tests and determined it wasn&#39;t cardiac or lung issues and was likely side effects from the COVID vaccine. On 1/8/21, Patient reports that she feels dizzy and is &#34;itching all over.&#34; She took antihistamine and that helped the itching symptom.

A 45-year-old female patient received BNT162B2, (Pfizer COVID Vaccine, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: Apr2021) intramuscular on an unspecified date at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included nortriptyline for migraine, botulinum toxin type a (BOTOX) for migraine and birth control medication.  The patient stated that, &#34;I was wondering if this was a reaction to the vaccination I had today. So I ended up 3 hours after I received the vaccine, I got very hot and clammy but at the same time had the goosebumps and then my whole body was as if I was sun burnt and my heart started to race. And then my whole body was red as if I had a sunburn. Actually I went to the ER today and they just did lab work because of the way I was feeling. All they gave me in the emergency room is IV fluids.&#34;  Therapeutic measures taken as a result of the events included IV fluids. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                The day after the injection I had a itchy red knot appear at the injection site. Starting 27 hours after injection I had chills, anxiety, slight shortness of breath, headaches, body aches. Today I have had nausea that comes and goes, the red knot is still present on my right arm and the redness has increased a small amount from the marking placed last night. The injection is not in my deltoid muscle or even close and I am wondering if that is at the least what created the redness and the knot.

                                                Short of breath; Chest pain; Heart above 120s; Fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular on 18Dec2020 at 20:00 at a single dose at the left arm in the hospital for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension. Patient was not pregnant at time of report. The patient previously took excedrin [acetylsalicylic acid;caffeine;paracetamol;salicylamide] and experienced allergies. Concomitant medication included Tejocote root. The patient experienced heart above 120s, short of breath, fatigue, and chest pain, all on 21Dec2020 at 13:00. Patient went to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit for the events. The patient received treatment which included Tylenol as needed for the events. Tested for Covid twice since the vaccination; Covid test post vaccination - Nasal Swab on 30Dec2020 and on unknown date, both with negative results. Cardiologist consult was pending. Outcome of the events was reported as not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 45-year-old female patient had medical history included hypertension, and was on concomitant medication.  The reported events short of breath and chest pain were more likely due to underlying disease, and less likely causally related to first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 45-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), intramuscular in left arm on 31Dec2020 at 08:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a workplace clinic.  Medical history included mild asthma and known allergies to bee stings.  There were no concomitant medications.  Within a few minutes of the vaccine on 31Dec2020, the patient felt a &#34;closing in&#34; sensation and then her pulse and blood pressure went up. She developed a severe headache and hot flushing with chest tightness. The medical team gave her epinephrine in right thigh and she felt a bit better. Then she started getting pale, sweating, and peripheral perfusion worsened so she was given a second dose of epi. She started feeling better, but had a headache, palpitations and &#34;brain fog&#34; for about 5 days after and she still having intermittent dizziness (unspecified date). The patient received epinephrine IM and benadryl IV push for the events. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient has no COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks and other medications in two weeks. The patient recovered from the events with lasting effects. The patient had not yet recovered from the event dizziness, while the patient recovered with sequelae for the remaining events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to plausible temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 45-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on the right deltoid, on 04Jan2021 at a single dose as she wanted added protection (Covid-19 immunization). The patient medical history was not reported. The patient has no heart issues but has a family history of heart disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient was asking if it is okay to take second dose after experiencing side effects of fever, body ache, joint pain, probably anxiety, chest heaviness 8-10h after (not wheezing, 98% O2 saturation) which returned next day and subsided. On 04Jan2021, the patient got her first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine, she was one of the lucky people who had joint pain, body aches, and a fever for about 3 days. She noticed about 8-10 hours after she got the vaccine that she started feeling heaviness in her chest, chest felt tight and heavy; not shortness of breath, harder to take a deep breath. She had no wheezing. In Jan2021, her oxygen level was 98%. She was chocking it up to anxiety in Jan2021. It went away. She had it the same day and the next day intermittently. It was short and passing. She is still having joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs. It is intermittent and mainly at night. She is supposed to get the second dose next Friday and asking should she go ahead and get the second dose. The joint pain had went away intermittently on Tuesday, then hit her harder on Wednesday. Thursday she felt okay but the Friday again was having the pain. It is still occurring. It is mainly at night. In the day she feels okay. It is when she lays down to relax that it kicks in. It is mainly irritating but she would say it is medically significant as it has lasted for a while, almost 2 weeks now and she is still having issues.  She takes 1000mg of acetaminophen (TYLENOL) to knock it out. The heaviness in her chest lasted about 1.5 hours the first day, and then went into Tuesday intermittently. The patient recovered from anxiety in Jan2021, body aches and fever on 07Jan2021, heaviness in her chest recovered on 05Jan2021, while other events were not recovered. The reporter assessed the events of Joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs, and irritating as medically significant. The reporter causality of the events for joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs, body aches, fever and heaviness in her chest were related to the suspect drug, causality for other events was not reported.  Information about lot number/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently provided, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of events of Joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs and irritating.

I had axilla lymphadenopathy, dizziness, nausea, joint pain, muscle pain and periods of tachycardia when standing.  This lasted for 7 days.  The lymphadenopathy was diagnosed in a routine mammogram/ultrasound screening 9 days after the vaccine.  I finally started feeling better the week I was scheduled to receive my second shot.  I got my second shot on 1/14/2021.  Within 12 hours, I had a 101 fever and muscle aches.  I also had axilla lymphadenopathy.  Within 3 days, I was feeling better, however about 8 days post vaccine, I started to experience bouts of tachycardia and dizziness again.  As time progresses, these symptoms are slowly improving.

A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EK570), via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was none and there were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated that she felt yucky afterwards on 23Dec2020, experienced shortness of breath on exertion and coughing on 26Dec2020; chills, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, body aches, fever on 28Dec2020; loss of taste, loss of smell and COVID-19 pneumonia on 07Jan2021.  All the events were reported as being medically significant.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: positive on 29Dec2020.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of COVID-19 pneumonia and included: started on bronchodilator, cough elixir, steroids and azithromycin (ZITHROMAX).  The outcome of muscle pain, body aches and COVID-19 pneumonia was recovering and of loss of taste and loss of smell was not recovered.  The causality of the suspect vaccine to the events was reported as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

A 45-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 04Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history ongoing included sickle cell trait (diagnosed as a child, sickly as a child, found out in 2016. It was reported that patient has the sickle cell that mimics the disease), ongoing high blood pressure, and ongoing genital herpes, and pre-diabetes, all diagnosed prior to vaccination, and &#39;blood pressure&#39;. Concomitant medication included chlorthalidone from 2018 and ongoing for &#39;blood pressure&#39;. It was reported that patient got her first dose of Covid vaccine on 04Jan2021. Patient stated that she has been experiencing some effects, started maybe 2 days after, she began experiencing fatigue (06Jan2021). Patient also stated that she has genital herpes diagnosed before the vaccine, and stated that she usually doesn&#39;t have an outbreak unless there is extreme stress on body. On 08Jan2021, patient clarified she experienced a genital herpes outbreak and thought that it may associated. Patient stated that she treated it with valaciclovir (VALTREX) and some cream and it went away. States that she had another outbreak after, treated it again, and it went away and now she is struggling with another outbreak of genital herpes. Patient also reported that she has on and off headaches (also reported as intermittent headaches) on 04Jan2021, states this could be due to her high/increased blood pressure which she first experienced on 14Jan2021 (as reported). Patient mentioned that her blood pressure has been higher than it ever has been after the vaccine. Patient also stated that she noticed that after the vaccine it was out of control, that she got a blood pressure cuff and it was 149/103, she contacted her nephrologist, stated she is treating it with her usual diuretic and the doctor just prescribed her amlodipine (NORVASC). Patient further stated that she is still struggling to get the diastolic blood pressure in the 90s, stated this is abnormal for her. Also is experiencing severe hip pain bilateral on 08Jan2021 after the vaccine. Patient further reported that she was a little over weight - usually about 150 sometimes 162 around this time she was 162. Patient clarified that her current weight is 159.2 and stated that she was diagnosed with sickle cell trait and stated that she has the kind that mimics the disease and will have a lot of side effects of sickle cell disease. Patient further added that she also has stage 3 kidney failure on 18Jan2021 due to either her high blood pressure or sickle cell trait and is also pre-diabetic. Patient also thought that the outbreak was associated with stress on body. Patient wanted to know if she refuses the second vaccine, if the first vaccine will do anything. Outcome of the events &#39;Stage 3 kidney failure&#39;, &#39;High/Increased blood pressure&#39;, &#39;Outbreak of genital herpes&#39;, and &#39;on and off headaches/Intermittent headache&#39; was not recovered, outcome of the event &#39;extreme fatigue&#39; was recovered on 06Jan2021, outcome of the event &#39;hip pain bilateral&#39; was recovering, outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stage 3 kidney failure was due to either the pre-existing high blood pressure or sickle cell trait or prediabetic condition, and was unrelated to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).

                                                In discussion with Dr., medical director at Detox, she  arrived night of 2/3/21 was quite intoxicated so was not going through any  withdrawal.  She was getting vitals and CIW  checked regularly.  First dose of  chlordiazepoxide 25mg was 2/4 at 1:25pm for CIWA 9.  She had repeat vitals at  5:50pm, CIWA 1, vitals: P 67, 118/79, 94% on RA, T 98.3.  she had complained of  some &#34;pressure in her head&#34; and feeling anxious, but otherwise denied other  complaints.  she was talking with others in the group, then other patients report  she suddenly started having seizure like activity around 6:45pm, med techs came  to help and found her stiff, gurgling.  they tried to get vitals on her, called  911, noticed that at 6:54pm she had lost a pulse and they started CPR.  paramedics arrived at 7:08pm and she was brought to ED.   Pt BIBA in cardiac arrest. Pt was at Detox Center when she  was reported to have seizure-like activity followed by collapse. She  was found to be pulseless and CPR initiated by staff members. EMS  arrived and performed approx 15 min of CPR and gave pt epi x 3 and  bicarb. No shocks administered but they did not report a rhythm.   In the emergency room the patient arrived and was found to be pulseless with PEA arrest, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated. ROSC ultimately achieved, patient remained very acidotic despite ventilator adjustment, head CT revealed cerebral edema.

                                                I experienced Fatigue, chest tightness, and increased blood pressure the first 2 days. Day 5 I started having pain in my upper back, left side. The next day had increased discomfort and developed a rash. Today, it is extremely painful and spread from the upper back to across my left  breast. My PCP agrees that it is Shingles. I am beginning a course of Valtex today, to lesson the severity of symptoms.

                                                Received the Vaccine on a Monday morning,  Next day started with a bad cold.  By Tuesday night I had to use my inhaler, take cold/cough medicine to help me stop coughing.  By Wednesday Had a bad cough, tightness in the chest,  and lots of congestion.  Left arm was very sore.  Called work who told me to go to the ER for covid test.  Tried to get into my doctor&#39;s office who would not see me and told me to get a covid test.  Tried to get into Facility who told me I would require two appointments.  One to see a doctor and another to get a Covid test.  Also, it would be a three to four-hour wait.  Felt so sick that I took myself to an ER in order to be seen.  Mysaturation was good in the ER but HR was in the 120s.  They did an EKG, gave me an albuterol inhaler, IV fluids, IV steroids, and a chest X-ray.  They did a Covid test which was negative as well as other bloodwork.   Then sent me home.  My husband also started with a cold the Sunday night before my vaccine so I do not know if that might have been where I got sick?

A 46-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Dec2020 10:30 at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ectopic pregnancy, hay fever. Concomitant medication received within 2 weeks included: loratadine, colecalciferol (vitamin D), olly womens multivitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No known allergies. About 15 minutes after the vaccine the patient experienced jaw tightening and muscle spasms. The patient was given oral Benadryl 50 mg. About 5 minutes after taking the Benadryl, her entire face and around her mouth went numb. The patient began having heart palpitations and felt a wave of heat rush up her back. She had hives on her chest. The patient received 1 dose of epinephrine from an Epi-Pen and transported to the emergency room for further treatment. Adverse event start date: 22Dec2020 11:00 AM. Events were considered as non-serious. Events resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse event included: Benadryl, Epinephrine, Solumedrol, Pepcid. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19. Test Name: SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (Nasal Swab) on 30Dec2020: Negative. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The temporal relationship is suggestive of an acute anaphylactic reaction. Based on the temporal relationship and the known pattern of response, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                15 minutes and 21 seconds after shot was given, I felt suddenly very hot, lightheaded and I could feel my pulse escalating. Nurse in the post-shot monitoring tent took vitals to confirm pulse at 95, when typically 68. I was laid down and BP dropped to 110/78. Chest tightness that I am familiar with from asthma started to develop and my neck and throat and upper shoulders felt very tight and constricted. I had some trouble swallowing water as though my throat was constricted and my breathing felt shallow. Nurses provided care and I was asked to get up and sit in a chair again. Within a minute, I felt dizzy and disoriented again and heart rate went up. The tightness in my chest and throat and shallow breathing continued along with my voice becoming hoarse.  The doctor on call asked if I?d had these symptoms before and I said I had after eating shrimp years ago. He decided to transfer me to the ER for monitoring . I stayed at the ER for about an hour and a half and was monitored. The constricted throat and asthma  chest tightness did not subside but did not get worse. Doctor recommended Benadryl every 6 hours as symptoms persisted. Within a half hour of taking 25 mg of Benadryl, I started to feel improved breathing and less throat constriction and easier swallowing. After the second dose of Benadryl, symptoms were much 70% gone, except for hoarse voice abs very slight tightness with swallowing.  I had informed the injection staff prior to receiving my vaccine that I am a person with a history of anaphylaxis (not to a vaccine) that required and epi pen and overnight hospital stay in the past .

                                                About 5 min after receiving vaccine - had just sat down after vaccine and had a weird sensation: like felt like rushed through my body and then instantly my heart started racing and I felt it thump into my throat. Let nurse in attendance know and she took me to another area secluded from others and told me to relax. Sat down. Hooked me up to monitors; blood pressure cuff  and  finger pulse and she left to go get someone and she brought EMT back with her. Felt tight in chest; in neck felt like there&#39;s tightening; but could still breathe; felt heavy: chest. Neck felt tight. Felt like I needed an inhaler. I don&#39;t have it with me as I only have asthma in spring and fall. They kept telling me to calm down and I wasn&#39;t feeling nervous. I was trying to relax. EMT asked questions and he said that the same thing happened to him. He told me I couldn&#39;t leave  Event Center until things calmed down for me. Released her when I felt fine but was just really tired and kind of shaky. I felt so exhausted. Told EMT that and he told me he would feel that way if he had just ran a marathon. I had slept 12 hours the night before. He didn&#39;t tell me what my heartrate went up to.  I left event center  at 9:49 pm. Started feeling strange again when doing errands and was at store afterwards (about 30 or 40 min later) - nauseous; dizzy; sweaty, clammy. Heart was racing again. I told husband I didn&#39;t feel right. Felt like I needed to sit because I was shaky. Left and went to vehicle. As we sat in car, I told him something wasn&#39;t feeling right. Mouth was so dry. He started driving. I felt like we were driving down a tunnel.Husband looked at me and said you don&#39;t look right either. Took me to ER in nearest hospital: blood pressure high; heart rate elevated; ER           (Hospital) The doctor did lab work. Triponin levels elevated; potassium levels low - sign of a heart episode and needed to get in control. Gave me potassium and took  more blood work and troponin levels started coming down. Dr advised me not to go back to get second dose. Personal Care Dr confirmed that I shouldn&#39;t get the 2nd dose - put in my records that I am allergic to this vaccine.  The next day I had severe diarrhea and terrible pain in my arm that went all the way down and up into my neck and whole right side head hurt. (really bad headache). Extreme fatigue. Went back to work on the following Monday evening and was exhausted doing my job. When I say family Dr on Tuesday, I didn&#39;t want to be taken off work because I was in the right place where people could take care of me and I&#39;d taken time off at holidays. That entire week was a lot of exhaustion and tiredness.

At about 1:45am on 1/13/2021, was feeling very achy and uncomfortable, so I went downstairs to get some Tylenol. Rapid heart rate and sweating, so much I had to sit down in the kitchen for a few minutes. Eventually took the Tylenol, and as I was heading back upstairs, I passed out (I don&#39;t remember going down to the floor) and dropped the cup of water I was taking with me. Was out for less than 30 seconds. A couple episodes of heaving/vomiting small amounts of liquid while on the floor. Made it back to bed and was starting to feel improved around 4:00am.

I also had a muscle pain in the arm and I felt tired during the day and in the evening. My pulse rate continues to be high. My pulse rate was 100 on the second day and for number of days it is around 95. Today it was 95 most of the day. I have not been regularly checking my pulse rate before, but based on what I found in some information in my medical record, it is most likely around 75. I notice the higher pulse rate through pulsation in the chest and temples. I have a hard time concentrating on work and reading things on the screen.

Wednesday night noticed using my inhaler. Little more- I took Half dose of prednisone. Had to do nebulizer  treatment later that night.  Thursday morning woke up wheezing took another prednisone and used rescue inhaler.  Went to work and wheezing didn?t get any better, but didn?t get any worse. Took another prednisone and sent home to do nebulizer.  Continued to rest and monitor asthma-   Notified PCP of what was going on- advised to continue Pepcid, benedryl and prednisone for a few more days and advise of any issues.

A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 in deltoid left at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications.  Family medical history relevant to event was none. Relevant tests were none. Patient reported she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021 and had pain at the injection site. On 07Jan21 she started having muscle aches and got something that look like hives on the arm and her skin felt really hot to touch, it was fire engine red on the right upper arm. On 08Jan2021, she woke up and felt like she got hit by a tractor trailer, has severe aches, voice very raspy, and very wiped out with headaches.  Patient mentioned injection site arm was bright red and warm to touch after injection, but has improved. When waking up this morning on 08Jan2021 even walking this morning from the bedroom to the bathroom she was fatigued and it has gotten better with her walking around, but she still felt wiped out. The muscle aches was very short lived. She went to do something at work and it took a minute for her to catch her breath and that and the muscle aches went away and that was it. An hour later she felt very flushed and itchy and coworkers joked with her about what she ate for lunch, which was nothing different. On the opposite arm from injection arm she had hives on the lower right arm. They were there about 15-20 minutes and it turned completely fire engine red and that lasted about half an hour. She showed the doctor she worked with and they recommended diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), which she didn&#39;t take, it was weird. All this subsided and she felt fine afterwards. Last night she felt very fatigued when walking around the house. This morning when she woke up she felt very, very, very fatigued. Walking took a lot of effort out of her. It is hard to explain, but people say this was how they felt when they had Covid. She felt very lethargic and very tired. Patient still had a lingering headache, but nothing like she felt earlier this morning. It&#39;s not terrible, but it wasn&#39;t pleasant for a couple of hours. Patient was unable to provide seriousness for today&#39;s events (08Jan2021), and stated it wasn&#39;t really life threatening, but more significant than yesterday. Patient denied having any other vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No history of problems or adverse events with vaccines in past. Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine with events were reported as related.  Events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Outcome of severe aches, voice very raspy, headache/lingering headache, wiped out /fatigued/tired were not recovered; outcome of lethargic, it took a minute for her to catch her breath, flushed and itchy was unknown, and outcome of other events were recovering.

                                                24 hours after 2nd dose my heart rate was elevated at an abnormal rate for more than 24 hours. The highest I recorded was 104 at resting. My normal is 74. I felt tired but wired and started recording it on my smart watch. After 48 hours it returned to more of a normal rate but still continues to be more elevated than before. I will follow up with my PCP this week. I had other symptoms that seemed normal-headache, chills, exhausted, sore arm, etc.

                                                Sudden, intense pain in the mid sternum just to the left side.  She recalls some dull vague pain over the past night, but the sudden pain developed about 3 minutes before I came into her office.  Pain was a 10/10 in severity and made it difficult to breathe and talk.  She was able to tolerate snow blowing this morning without notable difficulty.  Pain is not clearly exertional in nature.

I took additional ibuprofen and tylenol, and the pain has lessened somewhat today (Friday 01/22/21, noon)

A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (lot: EL3247, Expiry Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 15Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included food allergic. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced allergic reaction on 15Jan2021. The patient alerted she wasn&#39;t feeling well a few minutes after receiving vaccine. The patient was experiencing being flushed, had a fast heart rate, and her heart rate kept increasing over time, despite two benadryl, the patient had allergic reactions in the past due to food, so the patient knew what it felt like, so could expect it, so the patient spoke up soon, and the Epipen was given 28-30 minutes later, and after that, the patient said her throat felt thick and she had trouble swallowing, so was taken to the hospital. The patient seemed to be getting worse, after time, after the Epipen. The patient was most likely admitted to the hospital. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.

On 26Dec2020 she started feeling breast discomfort. She described the breast discomfort as a contracting feeling of encapsulation, reported it kept her up at night, she would have a heard time falling asleep or get no sleep at all that night. Her breast comfort started to lessen. The patient was breast discomfort or tenderness but she did not experience any breast discomfort till after she got the covid vaccine. She stated the breast discomfort was like a feeling that something was crawling inside, states it is like creepy crawlers. She also experienced a wet and cold sensation on her chest on 29Dec2020 and was still occurring once in a while, intermittently. At first it was just on the left breast, and the next night she felt the sensation across her chest, it felt like she spilled water and felt wet but it was not wt. She felt it while she was bed. She had breast implants. Last week she contacted her primary care doctor and she was sent to get a mammogram and ultrasound. She went to have the mammogram and ultrasound on Friday 08Jan2021 and everything was fine. She was thinking what she was experiencing was from the vaccine. The patient declined any treatment. No emergency room and no physician office required for the events. The outcome of event breast discomfort was resolving, of wet and cold sensation on chest was unknown.

                                                Within a few minutes of vaccine, I got a severe piercing headache and nausea / vomiting which we attributed to nerves and I went to go home without reporting. During the drive the headache and nausea got worse and my extremities and face began to tingle. My chest felt tight. My body was shaking. My colleague noted weak pulses and pale complexion. I am a doctor and gave myself epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and within 60 to 90 seconds the symptoms improved dramatically. I had my husband pick me up at the office and went home. The headache and nausea worsened on the drive but then settled down significantly. I rested for a few hours, then took oral pred 20 mg at about 2:45. I noticed that my headache was back and very intense at about 3:15 pm. No nausea this time, but my left eye began itching and it was very tight / hard to breathe. My extremities began tingling and I had spasms / tremors of my muscles. I injected another 0.3 mg epi into my thigh and followed with dex sodium phosphate 4 mg IM. Symptoms resolved within about 2 to 3 minutes. I took 40mg more of oral pred. I also took 10 mg of pepcid PO.   I am still feeling well now with no headaches or other symptoms at this writing (7:30 pm), but I have another doctor with me and we are 2 minutes from the ER if needed. I am marking unknown below since it has only been a few hours without symptoms.

                                                In the first 5 mins after the injection I became very irritable and then within 10 mins had a cold sensation in my head that I had previously had after a reaction to sulfa and had almost passed out.  I told a staff person who had me talk to one of the nurses &amp; put me in a separate space from people getting vaccinated.  The nurses then wasted a lot of time talking to me about anxiety instead of treating me.  The cold sensation traveled from my head down my neck, there was a sharp pain in my left breast, and then my heart started racing.  My lips and tongue on the left side started swelling.  I told the nurses this but they ignored me.  Eventually they brought in equipment to monitor my vital signs.  My blood pressure  and heart rate were higher than I had ever seen them and kept rising.  The head nurse eventually said I needed medical care &amp; there was no doctor on site.  She called the paramedics.  It was now 1 hour after I told them something was wrong.  The paramedics thought this was temporary because my bp fell to 153 [I told them I did not have a hist of bp this high]  from where it had been before &amp;   gave me Benadryl pills. (The ER doctor later said they should have done something).  Later that night my HR went up to 220 and I was taken to the ER.  The ER doctor also wasted time assuming it was anxiety but bloodwork showed I was in shock.  They first treated me with 4 aspirin, then Atavan, which all did nothing.  My bp was up to 189 the last time I could view the monitor.  Sodium chloride ivs, Bendaryl ivs were given after the bloodwork.  Diltiazem was eventually also given. I had palpitations that caused my entire body to shake. EKG showed I had developed an atrial flutter and the doctor said the flutter, arrhythmia, and tachycardia were caused by the shock from the vaccine disrupting the electrical signals in my heart.  I stayed overnight in the ER until Sat morning.  I took Diltiazem but jolting palpitations and tremors did not stop.  I saw a cardiologist on the 25th who concluded I had gone into shock from the vaccine, and I was given the wrong medication, and put me on metropolol.  Metoprolol lowered my bp and reduced the palpations.  I weaned off it with the doctor&#39;s permission.  I still have palpitations.

A 47-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK5730, expiry date: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 17Dec2020 at 07:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing neuralgia since 2003 (has nerve pain in her face and neck. It has never caused swelling and that she has had it for a long time. Symptoms started 17 years ago, became apparent in 2009), ongoing hypothyroidism since 2003 (Diagnosed about 17 years ago. Nothing has changed medication wise). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that she got the vaccine on 17Dec2020. On 25Dec2020, her shoes felt snug and by the next day she had 4 plus pitting edema. She could not fit in the shoes. She had the pitting edema for several days. She said that she went and bought compression stockings to help with the edema. It was her feet, ankles, and 3/4 way up her shins. It was more of the pedal area that was pitting. The patient further reported that she never had pitting edema before and the only thing new she had was the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event which included compression stockings. The patient was recovering from the event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported event pitting edema. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I&#39;m currently off and not able to receive comp due to the vaccine being voluntary.

A 47-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 30Dec2020 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high cholesterol (it was under control. Diagnosed a couple years ago). There were no concomitant medications. She did her first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 30Dec2020, and she had a little experience, she didn&#39;t tell the nurse at that time, but she went through her paperwork and decided to call Pfizer. When she got the shot, she was told to go to the next room to sit down for 15 minutes. When she went to the next room, 1 minute later, her heart started beating very fast, then she started to feel like she could not breathe/difficulty breathing for that moment. So, she tried to calm herself down and she focused on her phone to play games and to not think about it. After a couple minutes, it had gone. it was probably gone maybe about 10 minutes later. After 15 minutes, she went back to her office, everything was ok. Her heart was beating but not that fast, it was calmer than before, and she had a light headache, then some soreness on the vaccine site, on the left side, &#39;she thinks that is normal, right?&#39; Clarifies soreness as swelling and painful on the area where she was vaccinated. She wanted to know, was she able to go back for the second shot, she was scheduled for 20Jan2021. Regarding light headache, she took some paracetamol (Extra Strength Tylenol, strength: 500mg, expiration date: Jun2024, lot number: SJC214). Soreness outcome: It went away, maybe the third day (02Jan2021), it was completely gone. The third day it was ok to completely sleep and lean on that side. She has recovered completely. The third day (02Jan2021), she noticed an itch around that area (site of vaccine), but she was not scratching it. The itching had gone, she had recovered completely. The outcome of heart started beating very fast and could not breathe was recovered on 30Dec2020, light headache was not recovered, soreness at vaccine site was recovered on 02Jan2021, itching at vaccine site was recovered on an unspecified date of Jan2021, and swelling on the area where she was vaccinated was unknown.

                                                Within 1 minute after the injection I felt tachycardia and the tightness in my neck and an abnormal sensation in the back of my tongue.  This lasted for about 20-25 minutes and then  mostly resolved.  I was monitored by the paramedics.  I had normal vitals at the time of evaluation which was soon after notifying staff. After the 1st injection I had a similar episode, but I thought it was anxiety related.

A 47-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 08:49 (at the age of 47-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   There were no known medical history or concomitant medications.  The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization and experienced nausea, headache, and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, about 5-10 minutes after the second dose, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, reported as life-threatening. She reported that these events occurred within less than 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine. She went to the emergency room and was treated with methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), famotidine (PEPCID), and epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). She was sent home and prescribed methylprednisolone and epinephrine (EPI-PEN).  Later on 08Jan2021, she experienced dizziness and headache, which were consistent. She stated she would most likely take ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as treatment (not specified if taken). The clinical outcomes of the flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness were recovered on 08Jan2021; while the outcomes of the dizziness and headache were not recovered and that of the anaphylaxis was reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is limited. Based on the close temporal relationship and the description of the events, there is a reasonable possibility that the events are related to BNT162 vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

By morning I had a bad headache and terrible body/muscle aches. I was unable to report to work that day. By midafternoon, the nausea and stomach pains subsided, all other symptoms remained along with then getting a 100.5 fever. I was taking Tylenol every 4 hours since 1am and keeping hydrated. By midnight I was exhausted and was finally able to sleep. I woke the following morning with a dull headache and just felt achy. I felt much better by that evening (now Monday). Tuesday morning I woke with discomfort to my left armpit and clavicle area. I then noticed swelling, the areas felt ?lumpy? and were very tender to touch. That lasted about 2 days.

After the third day, symptoms subsided and I was back to normal activity. On the 7th day following the vaccine, I began having pain in the armpit of the left side. It was painful to have pressure on the area and to raise the arm overhead. It progressed on the the 8th day with increased pain and tenderness to touch. On the 9th day, I had severe pain with palpation and could feel a lump in the armpit. I have no redness, heat, or rash in the area. I went to my physician with concern because I have had a double mastectomy two years ago.

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL0140), intramuscular in left arm on 20Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was administered in a hospital. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Medical history included hypertension, overweight, and known allergies to bee stings and hair dye. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included multivitamins. On 20Dec2020, within 15 minutes, the patient began feeling dry throat, then itching, then it felt like she had a lump inside her throat. Then she began to have difficulty swallowing her saliva. And then the lump inside her throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time, the doctor had already injected the patient with Epipen and the pharmacist injected her with Solumedrol and she still felt as if she was having difficulty breathing and then she was taken to ER and she really can&#39;t remember too much after that. The patient was very groggy and then was discharged from ED about 9:30 pm. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date. Treatment for the events included epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of feeling dry throat, itching, felt like having lump inside her throat, having difficulty swallowing saliva, difficulty breathing and very groggy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I was vaccinated at 3:30pm .  At 5:27pm while driving home i felt a cold sensation in the back of my neck and back of my throat which began spreading to the back of my head . My heart felt as if I was startled by something.  I looked at my smart watch and my heart rate was 145.  I began trembling and having abdominal cramping . The back of my head felt like I had swelling or collection of fluid.  I opened my windows and began taking slow deep breaths to bring down my heart rate . It took quite a while to get it below 100. I felt as if I was going to pass out.  After deep breathing for what felt like atleasr 15 to 20 minutes , my pulse came down and I closed my windows . As soon as my body warmed back up in the car , the symptoms returned and my heart rate went back up to 130s , 140s . I had to keep my windows down and deep breathe the entire way home which took an hour . My body was trembling.  When I got home I felt as if I was too week to get out of the car . I still felt that startled feeling in my heart and was afraid of what could happen next . My lips and face were swollen.  My lips were also slightly itchy. I called 911 for help . By the time they arrived my vital signs had stabilized but I still had swelling in my face and lips . My EKG , vital signs and oxygen levels checked out normal so I did not go to the ER. That night I took benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 2 post vaccine the collection of fluid or swelling in the back of my head had now spread to the top . That night I had the feeling that my throat was swelling do I took benadryl and Tylenol and my face and lips were still slightly swollen . Day 3 post vaccine I woke up with slightly blurry vision. The swelling in my head now feels like it has encompassed my entire head and have a slight headache.  I went to the urgent care requesting an MRI of the head and an epi pen . I was given Medrol dose pack , an RX for epi pen for emergencies and advised to continue benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 4 post vaccine,  slight headache continues. Slightly blurry vision

                                                I received the vaccine in the afternoon of Jan 6th. Approximately 45 minutes to an hour later I felt lightheaded and like I was going to pass out. After a bit I felt a little better but remained dizzy and lightheaded. On the 7th I continued to feel dizzy and lightheaded throughout the day. I was sitting down on a call in the afternoon when my Apple watch vibrated and indicated my heart rate was below 50 for 10 minutes. I checked my heart rate and it was 38 - 48 BPM. On the morning of the 8th I reported my persistent symptoms to Dr. and an EKG was done showing a heart block. I have had bradycardia for the past year and likely the heart block but was not symptomatic until after I took the vaccine. See next pg

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine, the patient reported feeling flushed and hot with rash, shaking, shivering, and pain in upper chest, which the patient described as being normal because of her COVID pneumonia. I would rate the reaction as moderate. Diphenhydramine 25mg capsule was given by mouth, ice water was offered. Patient was closely monitored but no further intervention was necessary. After about 25 minutes, symptoms subsided and patient decided to leave.

Symptoms are swollen cheeks and welts , sudden itchiness at the site of my mask placement. The reason for this report is a sudden onset of excruciating and debilitating pain throughout my body specifically pain of my right shoulder radiating down my sprightly arm. I have been receiving testing and treatment for ongoing neuropathy due to Longhauler syndrome, however This recent pain is so debilitating, I spend most of my time in bed.  I have been experiencing chills then profuse sweating.  I also so fatigued, I sleep much of the day.  I have been having episodes of tachycardia with chest tightness which has increased since after having the vaccine. I also become short winded on exertion. I?ve been waking up in a panic and sweating.

Patient was laid flat on a couch, but then passed out and was not responsive to sternal rub.  After a code was called, the patient woke up.  At no time was there a loss of pulse or SOB.  Patient was transported to the ER and was subsequently discharged same day.  Patient did report that prior to the vaccination, she ran 13 miles in the morning, which may have had something to do with the reaction.

                                                I waited 15 minutes and was fine. As I was driving to my work, my injection site began to hurt severely and I felt my throat swelling, it became increasingly difficult to swallow. My tongue felt larger and my lips and face began to feel numb. I felt flushed and I became tachycardic. It lasted about 45 seconds and then waned and then would flare again.  I was able to speak and called my husband (a physician) who stayed on the phone with me while I drove to the hospital. I went straight to an outpatient unit and was given hydrocortisone IV, loratidine PO and famotidine. By the time I was on the unit, my throat only felt slightly tight with tachycardia down to 103. Following the injection of steroids, I only had one further flare of throat tightness and tachycardia that was transient lasting 30-40 seconds. Everything resolved within 40 minutes of receiving therapy. Of note, I apparently had erythema on the anterior of my neck which corresponded to the area of throat tightness.

I then  got in my car and I felt little bit sick and I picked up food and I started to feel sick. I went to work and my symptoms got worse and I sat in my desk and I felt like fainting.  I just felt so sick and I thought it was my diabetes.  A coworker saw me and told me i looked deathly pale and felt fainting and they took me to a ER room. They gave me Benadryl and IV fluids. I started seeing the floor and ceiling warped out, I was hallucinating.   My legs felt numb as well.  My eyes were twitching constantly. My blood pressure 147/95 and pulse was 112.   I went home, ate and went to sleep. On Saturday I felt better and went back to work 12-28-2020,  I  felt weak and stayed working at my shift. On Tuesday I worked 1  hour and still felt super weak.  Today I am starting to feel like myself again.  I will not get my second dosage due to my symptoms I have experienced.

This 48-year-old female Nurse (patient) reported that she received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1686), via unspecified route at left upper arm on 11Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant drugs included lisinopril for blood pressure/hypertension, omeprazole and vitamin supplements. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot# EK5730) on 21Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization and having a swollen lymph node along her collar bone on the left side which was on the side where she got the shot and it didn&#39;t really change much, it just kind of stayed the same size and it remained there for whole three weeks. Nurse stated then she got the second dose of the vaccine and thought that what she was having were a bunch of swollen lymph nodes, and that lymph node was now larger and she had a really big bulge like above the collar bone and going towards her neck and then another larger bulge under her right axillary (12Jan2021) and that one was causing off and on under the armpit, she was getting some shooting pain and her lymph node was larger now as well, the lymph node along her collar bone. Nurse further stated she also had some intermittent fatigue that she expected and also off and on feelings of like disconnection or feelings of like of being drunk. But that&#39;s not very bothersome, that&#39;s just once in a while since 11Jan2021. But she was concerned about the swelling of lymph nodes. No treatment was received for events. Outcome of events was not recovered. Nurse believed that swollen lymph nodes, fatigue and feeling drunk were due to the Covid 19 Vaccine.

                                                Within 5 mins of vaccine I felt my chest tightening.  I could still breathe but I could tell my lungs were tight.  Taking a deep breath was not normal.    Soon after I felt the muscles between my shoulder blades starting to tighten as well.  I think a response to my tightness in my chest.    We were instructed to stay in facility for 15 mins.  My symptoms did not increase after 15 mins so I went home. That was 5:00pm.  By bedtime at 10:00pm  my symptoms had resolved.    I?m not sure if I should get my second dose?

From my stay in the hospital on 07/14/2020  up until 02/15/2021 I had the minimum hair loss that  one would loss in a day. I am not sure if the vaccines caused it , but my hair literally came out in clumps.  I also started experiencing heart palpitations  along with SOB in the evenings after the first vaccine.  Upon  the second week in February, I started experiencing the palpitations and SOB in the evenings. Again, I am not sure if the vaccines caused this as I am post COVID.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included oxygen saturation: normal on an unspecified date, sars-cov-2 antibody test: positive  on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of felt like she had covid plus the flu, flu like symptoms. The events were described as follows: Patient said that she had some weird side effects from the 2nd vaccine, but not the first dose and believes that she had Covid in Dec2020.  Patient said that she had flu like symptoms, she said it felt like she had Covid plus the flu. She said that she also had chest pain, a very congested chest, a cough, and shortness of breath. She did not have that with Covid. She said that her symptoms came on about 10 hours after the vaccination and were gone within 48 hours.  Patient said that she does not know if having Covid so recently plays into it at all. Patient said that she received the last dose on 03Feb2021 at 1130. Patient said that the phlegm started in her throat and she had the chills. She woke up with the whole shebang. She stated that it got worse by the next day. She said that she did not feel a thing from the first injection and had no side effects. She never tested positive for Covid in Dec2020. Her mother ended up positive for Covid and she was exposed to her and showed symptoms. She had exhaustion vertigo, and general feeling of being unwell with Covid. She had all of that again, but she was told not to expect anything respiratory. She got concerned with the chest pain, cough, phlegm, and shortness of breath.  She saw the doctor on 05Feb2021 and she was instructed not to take anything because it could affect the vaccine, but her symptoms went away within 48 hours.  She said that she felt like the congestion felt like a allergic reaction for her, said that it was hard to swallow, and had a lot of phlegm in her throat. She said that it is not inherently different if you were allergic to flowers.  Chest pain she described like you are full of phlegm and like there is inflammation. Shortness of breath: Feel panicky when you try to breath and you feel the phlegm. Patient said that when she gets sick she does have a tendency to get upper respiratory infections. Like with a cold that she would end up with a cough that would linger a little bit. She still thinks getting the vaccine was worth it. She just wished that it would have been a listed side effect, because when it is not, you panic. Most people are worried about the shortness of breath. She reported that her O2 levels were ok when she checked.   Doctor gave her a vitamin IV to make her feel better. Told her that her lungs were clear and it was all upper respiratory.

Twice while I drove back to work and twice while I was working. These episodes were brief. I also experienced numbness and tingling in my arm that received the injection. This feeling spread to my shoulder and traveled up my neck to my face. I had numbness and tingling on my left side of my face and lower lip. This lasted  till about 3:30 pm and then went away.  Tonight around 7:00 pm I am still experiencing some numbness and tingling on my face and lip which comes and goes. I am having soreness in my arm at the injection site.

                                                I did let the nurse know right after I got the vaccine It did feel like  a huge water balloon was sitting on my arm and very heavy at the site. I went to the waiting area and the last 5 minutes and I started feeling weird, kind of getting dizzy and my heart started racing really fast. Am I can tell I was getting really hot and my face was flushed and my heart was racing and my hands started shaking, trembling almost like I couldn&#39;t control it. I&#39;ve never experienced something like this. The part that really scared me was my heart racing like it was going to come out of my chest. They called a code, put me in a wheel chair and took me to the ER (where I work).  They took my blood pressure which was really high, they did EKG, blood work and urine test. They kept me there for about five hours, while watching me. And the last weird thing that happened at one point I felt like liquid was running thru my body and my feet were really cold for several hours, It felt like someone was pouring liquid over me. I kept asking the nurse if this is normal and no one knew what to tell me.  After everything started slowing back down and it had been a couple hours and the next day i felt like I had a slight head ache and felt out of it, kind of  like I had a hangover and of course my arm was really sore.  The Doctor in the ER did advise me not to get the second dose as it will be worse than the first one.

At just about the 15 min wait time after ionjection a nurse asked if i was feeling ok. I told her i was feeling gine but my arm was very itchy. She checked the site and I had redness all around the site and welt size hives around the site. She asked me to stay 15 min longer and I agreed. Shortly after that the hive started to spread to my neck and chest area and I became lightheaded and faint feeling. I became very hot. They gave me and injection of benadryl and since my BP was high and my syptoms were not going away completly I was taken to the ER for monitoring and IV fluids. There I was given more Benadryl, steroids, Pepcid and IV fluids and monitored. I felt much better and was released to go home with a RX for 4 days of steroids.

                                                I woke up the following morning with pain and inflammation in RT armpit.. by midday the swelling in armpit lymph nodes was the size of a very large egg.  I couldn&#39;t comfortably put my arm down at my side.  Pain radiated down arm to elbow, and up neck into ears.  I had fever of 100.1, but took ibuprofen to try and alleviate pain.  The symptoms lasted about 5 days.

I have had several infusion reactions before to biologics to treat my autoimmune disease and this is how it always starts. There was nothing available at the administration place so I left and took zyrtec, benadryl and pepcid. The symptoms stopped in about 25 minutes.

My BP remained elevated on 12/28 and i  subsequently went to the ER  and  had chest XRay; EKG and cardiac workup done with all tests negative.  I was instructed by ER Doctor to follow up with  my cardiologist- Dr. and he subsequently  changed my medication regimen to  Metoprolol 25 mg tab  twice daily.  Since  that episode my BP has been well controlled.  I  am not sure if there is a correlation with the vaccine.  However i am bringing to your attention as i have never had a spike in BP while on BP meds.

I had malaise and fatigue.  I took some cold medicine 3 times in the course of 24 hours and woke up the next morning with none of those symptoms but did have lympadenopathy under my left arm that decreased through the course of the day.  It was painful to touch and tender once the lymph node decreased in size.  The only other reaction was the site pain and tenderness and warmth.  That lasted a few days.

                                                At 6 days after my second COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine (first dose given 12/17/20), I had acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath prompting a trip to the Emergency Department.  A chest CT Angio to rule out pulmonary embolus was done and negative for pulmonary embolus. My EKG showed some mild ST changes and a troponin I level was elevated at 0.08 (normal 0.04). Subsequent troponin levels 90 minutes apart showed a rising troponin at 0.18 and 0.38. An echocardiogram was performed which showed regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 45%.

                                                &#34;I received the Pfizer Covid vaccine Wed afternoon around 4pm. Thursday morning around 9:30 I started with severe pain in my left leg. The pain worsened through the day and my leg began swelling. No other symptoms at all. This morning my leg was twice the size of my right leg so I went to the ER. I live in so I&#39;m at ED. I have a massive blood clot running the the length of my leg - from my thigh to my ankle. I&#39;m very lucky I got here so fast! I?m a very healthy 49 year old with no history of DVT or blood clots so they dug further to find out why. A cat scan showed I have a congenital condition called May Thurner Syndrome. I?m so relieved to have an answer and it?s fixable! The vascular doctors are not 100% convinced that?s not all that was going on as I was born with the syndrome and I?ve gone this long without a clot. So they are doing lots of labs to see if anything else shows up. This is where we are at. I?m being admitted to take care of the clot.&#34;

                                                BP 218/116; headache; cold sweats; shivering; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient) reported that a 49-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EKS730), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 20Dec2020 11:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis both from an unspecified date. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medications included montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]), doxycycline, prednisone, and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL); all were taken from an unspecified date for an unspecified indication. The patient received the second dose of other vaccine (unspecified, Pfizer product, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 14Jan2021. On 20Dec2020 11:45, the patient had headache, cold sweats, shivering, and BP (blood pressure) 218/116. The patient called Rapid Response Nurse, and she was wheeled to the hospital E.R. The patient was seen by a doctor and opted to just monitor her BP, no medication or IV line started. The patient was discharged with SBP of 159. The outcome of the event BP (blood pressure) 218/116 was recovering while the rest of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The subject received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 20Dec2020 11:15.  On 20Dec2020 11:45, the patient had blood pressure high, 218/116 mmHg.  Based on information available, the reported high blood pressure was probably causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2, considering the plausible temporal relationship, and clinical course.  However, the concomitant medications, especially prednisone, for unspecified indications, could be confounding factors.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 49-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration at arm on 15Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Nurse stated that she just wanted to report what she thinks is adverse reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer not sure what to do about it at this point. She was vaccinated Friday 11 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. Both days felt really fine. Last night (16Jan2021) got some fullness under her armpit which was on the same side as the vaccine, which looked like swollen lymph nodes under her armpit which you can see was kind of benign. But in addition to that some generalized malaise lowgrade and headache (Jan2021). Seems totally fine but her both eyes are very swollen (Jan2021). Nurse took some ibuprofen (ADVIL)-600 mg, she was taking Prednisone for inflammatory prosthesis in her eye as treatment (Jan2021). Outcome of the events was unknown.   The nurse considered the occurrence of the events are because of COVID-19 Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Swollen eyes and Eye inflammation cannot be excluded.

A 49-year-old female (not pregnant) patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: ek9231) second dose on 06Jan2021 on left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism and allergies to penicillin. Concomitant medications in two weeks included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), liothyronine, magnesium carbonate (MAG 2), trimebutine maleate (MOTRI), zinc, curcuma longa (CURCUMA). The patient previously took BNT162B2 (lot number: ek5730) first dose on 17Dec2020 10:00 AM (age of vaccination was 49-year-old) on left arm for covid-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine was Hospital. No other vaccine in four weeks. On 10Feb2021 07:00 (also reported as 08Feb2021), approximately one month after 2nd vaccine, patient received a steroid epidural with contrast and a day after she had systemic reaction with numbness, tingling, extreme nausea, headache, thirst, palpitations, hypertensive crisis, changes to color of extremities, cold/heat intolerance, extreme thirst, mental fog, diuresis, inability to eat or sleep. Not sure if related to vaccine. No COVID prior vaccination. COVID tested post vaccination (Nasal Swab, PCR) on 17Feb2021 and result was Negative. The outcome of the event was recovering. AE resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization]. Hospitalization for 2 days. Patient received symptomatic management as treatment.; Sender&#39;s Comments: It is unclear what was the indication for the mentioned &#39;steroid epidural with contrast &#39; performed one month after the second dose of BNT162B2. The reported systemic reaction with numbness, tingling, extreme nausea, headache, thirst, palpitations, hypertensive crisis, changes to color of extremities, cold/heat intolerance, extreme thirst, mental fog, diuresis, inability to eat or sleep seems attributable to the reported procedure, or the unspecified indication for the procedure, rather than BNT162B2 vaccine.

I stayed in emergency and I got some green discoloration very big on my legs, I have to go to the allergist because I still had itchy in the body

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Vaccine received at 11:40 AM. At approximately 9pm I began to experience whole body chills, teeth chattering, and extreme fatigue. I took Ibuprofen and went to sleep. I experienced chills until approx 3 AM. My watch alerted my heart rate rose above 120 bpm three separate times during the night in the 1, 2 and 3:00 hours. Upon review of the summary it appears to have been sustained at just over 120 for that entire time. I awoke at noon, with a temp of approx 99.5 F, I felt extreme fatigue and a sense of cold but body was warm to touch and I was very sweaty this entire time. I slept most of the day and at 5 pm awoke with a temp of 102.4F. I contacted my physician who directed me to use tylenol and Benadryl. I took a dose at 5 pm, anther at 9 PM. Upon waking the next morning I was afebrile. At that time I felt slightly dizzy and lightheaded but also dehydrated. Forcing fluids relieved symptoms. I experienced a very mild headache and very mild queasiness as well.

A 50-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: paa156051), via an unspecified route of administration (arm left, dose number 1) on 17Dec2020 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Psoriatic arthritis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included etanercept (ENBREL), propranolol, and curcuma longa (TURMERIC CURCUMIN). Patient is on unspecified birth control and unspecified vitamins. No other vaccines in four weeks were given.

On 17Dec2020, It was reported that the patient was fine for the first 15 minutes, afterwards became very diaphoretic, woozy, heart rate went down to 43 and blood pressure down to 83/57. The patient recovered enough to leave about 20 minutes. After that, patient&#39;s heart rate was back into the 60&#39;s and BP stayed the same but the patient was feeling better. Patient&#39;s heart rate is usually in the 70&#39;s and his BP around 115/75 or so. The patient has no breathing problems. Other than headache and feeling a bit cruddy, the patient has been fine since. Patient mentioned she really wanted to take the second dose, but she does not know if she should. No treatment for the adverse events. No COVID prior vaccination and patient has not tested for COVID post vaccination. Event outcome was recovered on Dec2020. Events were considered non-serious.

A 50-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284, expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at right deltoid on 29Dec2020 17:45 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2003 and ongoing, tachycardia and major surgery. Concomitant medication included maintenance inhaler (unspecified) for asthma. Patient was officially diagnosed with asthma in 2003. She said her asthma was controlled, and she takes a maintenance inhaler every day. She said she has been taking the same maintenance inhaler since she was first diagnosed with the asthma. She said she rarely uses a rescue inhaler. Reported she was prescribed the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg for her tachycardia that she had after her major surgery, but she did not take the full 25mg dose during that time. She said she hasn&#39;t had taken the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg in almost a year, clarifying it was last Jan2020 that she used the Metoprolol Tartrate. The patient previously received a flu shot in Oct2020, and felt rundown for a day afterwards, but that she always does after she receives a flu shot. She said she had no heart issues after receiving the flu shot in Oct2020. The patient who is a registered nurse reported she received the COVID-19 vaccine last night at work, on 29Dec2020, at 5:45PM, and had experienced some tachycardia after receiving the vaccine. Reported the COVID-19 Vaccine was offered through her employer. She said the COVID-19 vaccine was optional and offered to all employees if they work at the hospital. She experienced the tachycardia at 11:00 PM last night, 29Dec2020. She said her normal resting heart rate is between the high 60s to low 70s. She said her heart rate at 11:00PM last night was at around 100, clarifying she was not running a fever at that time. She stated after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she was not feeling right, so she took the day off from work today, and slept in. She said when she woke up this morning (in Dec2020), she still didn&#39;t feel right, saying she felt weak and wobbly, and when she checked her pulse it was 115. She said she does have a past history of tachycardia. She said a year ago she had major surgery, and she had tachycardia after the major surgery. She said the tachycardia eventually went away, but she did have to see a cardiologist and take a beta blocker. She said she took a tiny dose of the beta blocker this morning, and called the cardiologist to let him know what was going on. She said she has not heard back from the cardiologist yet. She said the tachycardia went away once she took the beta blocker this morning. She said she took the beta blocker because her heart rate was going higher, and higher. She said she didn&#39;t want to end up like last year after her major surgery with a heart rate in the 170s. She said the tachycardia she was experiencing after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine was not normal for her. She said once she got over the major surgery last year, her heart rate was fine. Reported her employer was making employees wait around for 15 minutes after the employees received the COVID-19 Vaccine to make sure no one had a major reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, she waited around longer than the 15 minutes. She said she felt weird after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and thought maybe she was experiencing anxiety. She said she was lightheaded on 29Dec2020 after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and completed a report right then on the website. She said the website is for reporting adverse events, and she was sent a website link to complete the adverse event reporting. She said she signed into the website link while she was still at the hospital. She said one of the website&#39;s first questions asked was how she was feeling. She said the question made her wonder if her lightheadedness was due to her heart rate being up because she becomes lightheaded when that happens. She clarified she reported only the lightheadedness on the website, and not the tachycardia. She said her lightheadedness got better and she was fine, and then at 11:00PM the tachycardia hit her like a switch. Reported this morning she felt fine, and then all of sudden she wasn&#39;t fine. Tachycardia Treatment: Reported she took a 8.5mg dose, or one quarter of a 25mg tablet (as provided by the reporter) of the beta blocker Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning and called her cardiologist to let him know. She said she split the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning, and only took a quarter of the 25mg tablet (reported as a 8.5mg dose by the reporter). Reported she believes 100% that her tachycardia was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine, saying she has been fine up until receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she got the COVID-19 Vaccine because she was afraid of getting the COVID-19 Virus with her asthma. She said she has no other preexisting conditions besides the asthma. Reported she is not going to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said it was scary when her heart rate shot up out of nowhere. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine is the only thing different she has done. She said before the COVID-19 Vaccine, she was completely fine. Patient asked if the Pfizer DSU agent had heard of anyone else who has experienced tachycardia after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome of the event tachycardia was recovered in Dec2020, event lightheadedness was recovering and unknown for the other events. The reporter assessed the event &#39;tachycardia&#39; as Serious (Medically Significant).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tachycardia with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded. The medical history of tachycardia and asthma medication may be contributory as well.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 50-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 02Jan2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications, taken within two weeks of vaccination, included ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient previously took amoxicillin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and experienced allergy. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced feeling close to loss of consciousness, intense chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath, and chills while driving home on 02Jan2021 at 12:00. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of feeling close to loss of consciousness, intense chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath, and chills while driving home was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of feeling close to loss of consciousness, intense chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.   The underlying predisposing condition of penicillin allergy may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.

                                                About 15 min after injection my heart started racing and I got lightheaded. Heart rate was 95&#43; and BP was 190/90 something. My resting HR is 56 and BP is usually around 120/80.  Began to drop after about another 15 minutes. Followed by migraine for the rest of the day.    Felt okay when I woke up, but had one episode during the day today in which my heart rate shot up again and was a little short of breath even though I was not exerting myself. Lasted about 10 minutes.  Injection site hurts to the touch, but otherwise is painful.   Throat hurts a little and a little congested, but probably unrelated.

A 50-year-old female patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included tachycardia, tension headache, and glucose tolerance impaired.  Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), gabapentin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  On 18Dec2020, the patient experienced hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, tetany, muscle cramps, and hemoglobin dropped little bit.  The clinical course was as follows: The patient received the vaccine and about 30 minutes later she started to &#34;feel bad&#34;. She went to the urgent care and about an hour after they took her to the emergency room (also reported as hospital). She had a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and magnesium level done on the 18th, 21th, 23rd, 26th, 28th, 30th of Dec2020 and then again on 04Jan2021.  On 18Dec2020, her initial lab test showed potassium: 2.6, hemoglobin: 10.2, magnesium: 1.2, and calcium: 5.7. The physician assistant reported that a potassium of 2.6 was critically low and a hemoglobin was 10.2 was about normal for the patient. She received oral medications of potassium 20 mEq twice a day and calcium and magnesium supplements once a day. On 04Jan2021, lab data showed:  potassium: 4.2, magnesium: 2.1, calcium: 9.5 and hemoglobin: 14.5. Per the reporting physician assistant, the above levels went back to normal but stated she had to be supplemented to get back to that point. The clinical outcomes of the hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hemoglobin dropped little bit were recovered on 04Jan2021; while that of the tetany and muscle cramps, were unknown. The physician assistant assessed the events as related to the suspect vaccine.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I drank some water and sat up in bed for a while.  The pounding heartbeat settled down in about half an hour.  I did not take Advil or anything else because of the nausea.  Later in the morning I had some nasal congestion.  Symptoms persisted but slowly waned until 6:00pm that day.  After that, fatigue was the only symptom that lasted until about the 48 hour mark.

                                                We (myself and 2 other pharmacists) were conducting a COVID-19 vaccine clinic. The patient is on staff at the clinic and came in for her 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine. 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient started experiencing SOB, tingling fingers and face, and swelling of her lips and tongue. She moved herself outside to cooler air and then sent someone back inside to ask us for help. I ran outside with an EpiPen and immediately noted her pulse of 158 on her watch and she appeared to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. Patient stated she did not want to use the EpiPen but wanted to try chewing Benadryl instead first. I asked the staff for a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. The 1st readings, approximately 12 minutes after vaccination, were HR 158, BP 155/105, and pulse ox 97%. Patient stated the Benadryl was working and her swelling was decreasing. The patient was not having trouble breathing at the time. I continued monitoring vitals and talking with the patient and approximately 20 minutes post-vaccination, she was improving (BP down to 134/80 and HR 120) but agreed we should call 911. She decided she wanted to move inside and lie down. I escorted her with support to a bed. Her vitals then increased again to BP 152/95 and HR 133 and her lips and tongue started swelling again. The patient appeared to be more labored in breathing then but still refused the EpiPen. Roughly 5 minutes after lying down, the medics showed up and took over and I went back to the vaccination area. I learned later that the patient refused to go to the hospital and after more observation was eventually allowed to leave with a friend/coworker driving her home.

I only took Metoprolol for one day.   My PCP recommended an EKG.   Today I still more fatigued than usual.

Reported she received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 22Dec2020 at 7:00AM in her left Deltoid. She said she had a reaction after receiving the first dose of the COVID- 19 Vaccine. She said her lips were tingling slightly, clarifying her lips were swollen too. She said she took some Benadryl (she clarified she did not have the Benadryl NDC/UPC, Lot or Expiration Date), and the Benadryl took away the lip tingling and swelling. She said she was tachypneic, and developed muscle pains (clarified as myalgia), joint pain, severe headache, weakness, and nausea.

She said she had the PCR COVID-19 Virus test about 3 weeks ago, Dec2020 and the test was negative. She said she thought she had the COVID-19 Virus after receiving the first COVID- 19 Vaccine dose because no one else she knew who had the COVID-19 Vaccine had any issues. The outcome of the events joint pain,. myalgia, tachypnic, headache, pale and nausea was recovered on an unknown date in Dec2020; the outcome of the event tingling lips and swollen lips was recovered on 22Dec2020; while the outcome of weakness was unknown. The events were assessed as medically significant and causality was reported as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close compatible temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the events were related to the vaccination with BNT162B2.

                                                Got booster shot on Wednesday the 20th, came home and was fatigued. Thursday had horrible headache that would not be relieved with tylenol. I took a plane and arrived at 1130 pm. I went to bed shortly after arriving at my daughters house. Friday morning, I was unable to be woken up and my daughter called 911. I was in a coma. I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully. She explained to me what happened. I am still in the hospital, as they are keeping me for observation and trying to determine if my kidneys will start working properly again.  Prior to this, I have only ever had a kidney infection, and I thought before I might have had the start of a UTI.  I do have chronic high blood pressure as well, a long term side effect from open heart surgery 10 years prior for an aneurysm, but aside from that I am relatively healthy 50 year old.

Transported to nearest hospital, I had to have emergency surgery on left ankle, by Dr.  A plate and screws were placed in my ankle to stabilize the break.  I am being treated and monitored by my general doctor for the concussion.  I am currently non-weight bearing on my ankle, for a minimum of 2-4 weeks.  I am unable to work due to the ankle break and concussion, for an undetermined amount of time. I am scheduled to meet with Dr. on the 4th of March, at which time he stated  he will want to begin physical therapy, once the break has reached an adequate stage of healing.  I will be re-evaluated by my general Dr. for the concussion in 2 weeks.

                                                4 to 5 hours post vaccination I began to get very dizzy or &#34;woozy&#34;, had a pounding heart sensation, felt very &#34;clammy&#34;, and had general ague upon any type of exertion such as walking a very short distance using my rolling walker device.  This happened 3 times in approximately 2 hours on the day of vaccination.  The next day (03/05/21) my blood pressure and heart rate were very elevated (BP 174/111, Heart Rate 168); I went to the emergency room where they were unable to lower my heart rate but sent me home anyway.  03/7/21 I went to ER, where I was diagnosed with atrial flutter and admitted. The atrial flutter was corrected via cardioversion and I was released 3/9/21; I was prescribed Multaq 400mg, 2X/day and take it faithfully.

She said she felt very far away and just kept repeating I don&#39;t feel well. She was diaphoretic and her chest was very red and she kept scratching and rubbing it at it. I asked if she wanted IM Benadryl or epipen and she at first denied. She also said she felt like she needed to focus on her breathing. At this time we decided it was best to administer Epipen x 1 dose. Immediately after she felt better. She was observed for another 30 minutes and then went home. at 7:17pm I called and spoke with her. She said her arm was sore and that her oxygen levels were about 88-89% which is low for her but she said she felt fine and is currently working right now.

A 51 years old female patient received the 1st dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via Intramuscular on 28Dec2020 10:00 at single dose in the arm left for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included change in taste, altered taste. Concomitant medications were none. Caller reported she was having side effects with the COVID vaccine she received yesterday (28Dec2020) morning at 10am. The patient experienced paresthesia, tingling in hands and feet and they are cold, said she &#34;felt cold&#34; and has soreness in the injection site on 28Dec2020 17:00. Caller confirmed the above details. Her hands got really cold and tingling to them and she was wondering what this is and went to her other half and asked him to take a look. It passed and lasted about 10-15 minutes and just thought it was unusual. Did a 5:00pm check-in and she was doing okay and everything was fine so she didn&#39;t mention it. At 7:00pm she got tired and laid down and started feeling the tingling in the fingers and her hands. Upon waking this morning when her feet met the ground it was intensified, the tingling, and she went to walk it out it got better, but she is still having the tingling in both fingers/hands and feet. Stated unsure of seriousness criteria for the tingling in hands and feet and coldness. Wondered if it is something she needs to worry about that is why she called. Is it something that could go away or worse like with Guillain-barre syndrome. It&#39;s not disabling, but it is concerning. Unable to provide the NDC or expiry for COVID vaccine given. Stated she can&#39;t understand the writing on the card provided for her with product details. Does see on card Pfizer, X40113 and stated the lot number looks to be either &#34;ES1685 or EJ1685 or E51685&#34;. Unable to provide the dose/strength. Received this vaccine at her workplace. Mentioned in past she had flu vaccine with the additive of mercury and experienced changes in taste, altered taste. It was reported to her primary care provider. This was between 6-8 years ago, unable to provide name of vaccine, NDC, Lot, or expiry. Since then she only receives single dose vials instead of multidose vials. They were looking for a list of side effects and wanted to know if she should seek care for her symptoms, it&#39;s unusual. Wanted to know if the side effects she is having is something Pfizer has been seeing and will it go away and when. Previous transfer agent sent her to safety. It is difficult to navigate the website. Outcome of event fatigue was unknown, while outcome of other events was not recovered. Causal relationship between vaccine and events &#34;paresthesia, tingling in hands and feet&#34; &#34;hands and feet are cold&#34; &#34;soreness in injection site&#34; were related by agency and Primary Source Reporter.

Sat down, drank water and ate a cookie. The feeling did not subside. After about another 20 minutes, felt tingly all over. After about 5 minutes of that, the tip of my tongue started too tingle. I alerted the staff and they checked my pulse (nl in the low 60s) and my BP (normal SBP 112). They gave me liquid Benadryl 25 mg and the tingling immediately stopped but I still felt lightheaded. They transported me to the ED. I was given 1 L of fluid and monitored and rested for about an hour, then I felt fine. No other tests or meds given

Tachycardia increased to 130s for 2 minutes  then came down to 100s, BP 140/86, a little nausea and slight headache. Better at 4:45 thought I was good to leave. Then BP spiked to 180/110s, HR 136, transported to ER for monitoring.  Tachycardia and HTN would continue to cycling elevate over next 2hours before being discharged with HR of 100s and BP 150/86

                                                Severe respiratory distress; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist.   A 51-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection),Lot# lot number: EL1284, intramuscular at right arm on 07Jan2021 12:00 PM,  at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. No known allergy , no other medical history.No COVID prior vaccination. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility .No any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No Concomitant medications (received within 2 weeks of vaccination) . On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced Severe respiratory distress that resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care.It was unknown if  treatment was received for the event. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal relationship between Severe respiratory distress and BNT162B2 cannot be completely ruled out considering the temporal relationship.  However, more information would allow for a full medically meaningful assessment, especially medical history, concomitant medications, concurrent illness and event details.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 51-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EH9899), intramuscularly on 28Dec2020 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left arm and it was the first dose. The facility type vaccine was hospital. Medical history included migraine from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included erenumab aooe (AIMOVIG), estradiol, diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), trazodone hydrochloride (TRAZODON). No known allergies. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced shortness of breath, stridor, migraine for 5 days and 10 days later cellulitis at injection site on 28Dec2020 15:00. Patient received Antibiotics, steroids epi as treatment for the adverse events. The adverse events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of event migraine was recovered in Jan2021, other events was recovered on an unknown date. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Vaccination site cellulitis, shortness  of breath, stridor and migraine,  due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 51-years-old female patient (no pregnant) started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number el3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 at the first single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included supraventricular tachycardia, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypermobility syndrome, developmental hip.  Concomitant medication included hydrocortisone, trazodone, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN).  The patient previously took erythromycin, morphine and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis, throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache on 06Jan2021 11:15. Seriousness criteria reported as life threatening. Taken to ER had IV benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid for anaphylaxis. Placed on O2 and given albuterol nebulizer. Had IV fluid bolus. Now on benadryl and 5 days of prednisone. The patient felt completely fine prior to vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 06Jan2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. No other vaccine in four weeks; No covid prior vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis presented as throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of drug allergies may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.

She felt a little short of breath. She started to get fluid-filled blisters on bilateral palms. This is a milder form of the reaction pt has to flu vaccines (she was advised by PCP not to receive flu vaccines because of the blistering). Pt took diphenhyramine 25 mg PO x 1 and the fluid-filled blisters resolved within a few hours.  12/28 around 0330, pt awoke and felt like her right carotid was &#34;pulsating.&#34; Pt drank water, did not go back to sleep. &#34;Pulsating&#34; resoved within an hour. No other symptoms develped. In the morning, pt called employee health RN who instructed her to contact PCP and report the reaction. Pt called PCP who advised pt not to get second dose of vaccine due to her reaction to COVID and the flu vaccines.

                                                received my shot at 8:15 am, within approximately  45min I felt a very slight heaviness to my breathing something similar to allergy season belreathing, and a slight headache on my rr temple. This was nothing that stopped me or slowed me down that day.   At approx 10:30pm I awoke from a deep sleep with SHARP chest pains, at 11pm chills, 1am fever and discomfort, 2am muscle aches.  I slept on my left side to keep blood circulating to my heart which seemed to ease some of my discomfort. My first night was rough. I awoke Thurs (12/24) with a swollen left foot and leg. some rt leg pain, joint pain in my left knee. I pushed myself to get up and move and go about my day. Friday, I still had a little left foot foot swelling and pain, knee pain, but kept pushing. The handout says if symptoms persist for longer than 24-48 to seek medical care, I have not.  Friday, (12/25/20)was Christmas and much of the day was non eventful. At approx 530pm. I felt a bulging not in the center of my chest which was tender to the touch. This concerned me. I gently messaged the area, rested a bit but continued to move up and down the stairs. That discomfort and the bulge decreased within a few hours.   Saturday, (12/26) 4:am and I have notice much of the swelling in my foot and legs has decreased, however, I now have bruising. The sore arm is gone, and I am hopefully, all is well. I forgot to mention, I have had intermittent persistent cough with slight sob, something similar to the start of allergy season, but it is brief. I have been coughing at night. I have a history of whooping cough. And gastric bypass.

Took Tylenol every 4 hrs and fever (101. 5)returns in 1-2 hrs. Pulse ox remained normal, 98%, but pulse was 99/min. Usually my resting pulse ox is 55/minutes.  Was unable to go to work and see patients.  Had these symptoms for 48 hrs even though stayed in bed, took Tylenol around the clock and drank plenty of fluids (2-3 liters of water in addition to natural orange and apple juices). Never lost appetite either, do eating my vegetables and fish diet. Ice cream help between Tylenol?s. Completely resolved after 72 hrs. Now still have  LEFT  injection site tender deltoid and left axillary tender nodes, improving as well. All along breathing fine, no cough or congestion or sore throat. No anosmia  or dysgeusia.  This was after my second Pfizer dose.  After the First dose only had tenderness on the RIGHT deltoid muscle injection site and tender axillary node, resolved by now.

A 51-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 03Jan2021 at 10:00, at a single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies (unspecified). The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in a doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient experienced 3 &#34;waves&#34; or what her many coworkers were describing as &#34;whooshes&#34;. The first two occurred minutes apart approximately 4-5 minutes post vaccine-last less than one minute each. The 3rd wave occurred after lunch approximately 3 hours later-lasted approximately 2 hours but not as intense as the first times. The patient further described the symptoms as &#34;felt like a rush&#34; (unspecified) experienced when receiving epinephrine. She was short of breath, lightheaded, dizzy, like pre-syncope as she felt like she could pass out but did not do so. The events occurred on 03Jan2021. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.

I was taken back to medic area and was assessed. My oxygen was good but my pulse and BP were high.  I layed down and after 10 minutes felt better and my pulse recovered.  Shortly later I was told I could go home.  I sat up and felt briefly dizzy then my heart started racing again (pulse 137).  I layed back down and EMS was called. By the time they arrived my pulse had slowed to normal but I still had a headache. This was about 45 min after vaccine.  They performed an EKG and monitored my vitals as I sat up and then stood up. I did not have any incidents of my heart racing but my BP was 157/98 so I was told they could take me to EC for monitoring or to my doctor.  I chose to go to my doctors.  I arrived at my doctor an hour later and still had elevated BP and headache . He chose to monitor me. I had another incident where my heart started to race so he gave me liquid Benadryl and let me rest.  I think I had one more milder incident of my heart racing but it was not as strong.  After about 3 hours I went home and was told to monitor for Anaphylaxis. I went home and slept 3  hours and woke up feeling fine.  I was fatigued for next 3 days but not issues with heart. About day 5 I was working and had a couple of incidents where I felt my heart pick up a little bit and I couldn&#39;t catch my breath.  After that I feel like I was fine and don&#39;t remember any more incidents.

Was feeling better and about 90 minutes later felt warmth over my heart, my lips and mouth became tingly and both arms went numb and uncertain if my heart monitor showed abnormal. Was admitted overnight for observation. About 10 hours later had warmth in my chest, heart started beating fast, numbness in arms and around mouth and slight tightness in throat. Benadryl administered and heart calmed after couple of minutes, numbness went away after couple of minutes and tightness in throat went away after an hour.  Again about 13 hours later the warmth in chest and heart racing only symptoms. Given another dose of Benadryl. The symptoms only lasted a couple of minutes.  I also saw a cardiologist who ordered an echocardiogram just to rule out anything with my heart. It was normal.  I was sent home with instructions to use Bendryl oral for 3 days every 12 hours. I was told it could be from vaccine and I was to follow symptoms for 2 weeks and if not better to see cardiologist to look at other reasons.

A 51-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK5730, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 12:00 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included patient was working in healthcare and around Covid positive patients daily.  There were no concomitant medications. 10 minutes after getting bnt162b2, patient noticed side effects. Patient had a metallic taste in throat and a few more things. Right after getting it she had a flushed feeling in her body and legs, similar like IV contrast. 10 minutes after that so about 20 minutes later she had mid chest tightness and weakness that was gone after about 40 minutes to an hour. Patient was unable to provide any seriousness criteria, stating it was scary for a moment and she didn&#39;t know what it was, but the mid chest tightness could have progressed to something more serious. That was how she felt at that moment, but after it was all gone, it was not serious. She did not know why or what the reason was or if she was lucky or what. Patient was sitting for 10 minutes after receiving Pfizer COVID vaccine and was doing something on her phone when she started experiencing these symptoms unexpectantly. Eventually the nurses observing her after a half hour took her to the emergency room since she wasn&#39;t feeling any better. Patient had emergency room visit for all events. Outcome of events was resolving.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported mid chest tightness and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the plausible temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 25Jan2021 this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 51-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3247, expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 17:45 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing severe Crohn&#39;s disease, pneumonia, allergy to eggs/anaphylactic reactions to eggs, anaphylactic with bee stings on 2020 (this has happen twice in 2020), collapsed her lung (reaction to anesthesia that collapsed her lung), high fever, anaphylactic reactions. Concomitant medication included sertraline (SERTRALINE), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]). The patient previously took Hep B and experienced fever, flu like symptoms, achy, and lethargic (no issue with the first 2 doses but with the 3rd dose she had a high fever); MMR and had an adverse reaction. It was reported that the shot was given on 19Jan2021. She experienced the following severe dizziness which started that day (17:45) and lasted 3 days. It has resolved. Nausea which started that day (17:45) and stayed constant for 3 days. Now it has only been happing in the late afternoons or evenings. Light headed which started that day and last 3 days. Headache (17:45), the initial headache felt like her whole head was going to explode into a 1000 piece. Now it just starts about 4-5pm in the evening. It was better and not as severe but like a migraine with nausea (17:45), feeling crappy (17:45), and body aches. Body aches which started on the day of the shot (17:45) and lasted 3 days. Fatigue which started on the day she got the shot (17:45) and was ongoing in the evening now chills and sweats which started on the day she got the shot and was ongoing. Her husband asked about if this was being related to the change of life but she doesn&#39;t think so. Fever which happened on the day she got the shot (17:45) but not at the site, later that night and was 105.00 with Tylenol. It has resolved. She noted that her blood pressure tends to be low but was 95/81 at the time she got the shot (17:45). The patient has not taken her blood pressure and does know if this has resolved. It was relayed that she took Tylenol and Benadryl before the shot due to her history and was still taking it as treatment for the symptoms. She has a lot of drug and other allergies, the only that was anaphylaxis was bees and egg. This was why she brought 2 EpiPens when she had the shot. She didn&#39;t have to use her EpiPen and was really proud of that but did have some reactions.  The patient reported she did not go to the doctor. At this point she was somewhat expected that she had a not great reaction so the fact that she could still breath after getting it was a good thing. She also noted she could not have driven home due to dizziness. The patient was not brought to the emergency room and did not went to a physician&#39;s office. The patient has an ongoing medical history of Crohn&#39;s disease and reported that yesterday (as reported) started a flare up but she was not sure if this was related to the vaccine use. The patient recovered from fever on 23Jan2021; was recovering from dizziness, body aches, severe headache, nausea, chills, sweating, and fatigue; while outcome of blood pressure tends to be low, feeling crappy and Crohn&#39;s flare up was unknown.

I called my PCP who ordered an EKG, CXR, COVID swab, a metabolic panel,  a CBC, and a D-dimer. My D-dimer was elevated and he called me to go directly to the emergency department, which I did and had a CTA chest. I was diagnosed with multifocal pulmonary emboli in my right lung with a slight pleural effusion on my left lung. I had a duplex ultrasound of my legs which was negatve for DVT, and an echocardiogram which was within normal limits. I was finally diagnosed with acute unprovoked pulmonary embolism, given a Heparin bolus and started on a Heparin IV infusion. Ultimately, I transitioned to Eliquis PO and was discharged from the hospital within 24 hours.

A 51-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200, expiry date: 21Feb2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 17Feb2021 15:40, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2012 to (diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus almost 9 years ago), neuropathy in her feet/nerves and reported that she only turns pink if she gets overheated. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Historical vaccines included influenza vaccine (reported as flu vaccine) which she gets every year and pneumococcal vaccine (reported as pneumonia vaccine) which she gets every 5 years. The patient reported that she received her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 17Feb2021 and had an allergic reaction. She said she was at a podiatry appointment, and her podiatrist told her the pharmacy had an extra COVID-19 Vaccine available. She said the pharmacy staff came to her podiatrist&#39;s office to administer her COVID-19 Vaccine. She said about 5 minutes after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine injection, on 17Feb2021 15:45, her left arm started feeling flushed, her left arm started getting hot, and the hot sensation traveled down her left arm to her left hand, and up to her left shoulder and neck. She said 20 minutes later, she walked from her podiatrist&#39;s office to a nurse&#39;s station to be monitored further. She said while she was at the nurse&#39;s station, a doctor came by twice to evaluate. She clarified the upper part of her left arm started turning pink, and then red. She said her podiatrist asked her if that was a normal reaction for her. She said she told her podiatrist she only turns pink if she gets overheated. She said her left hand got numb and tingly. She said the muscles in her left arm between the inside of her left elbow down to the inside of her left wrist were &#34;twingey&#34;. She said her podiatrist and his nurse felt both her arms, and said her left arm was much warmer than her right arm. While she was at the nurse&#39;s station being monitored, she felt short of breath. She said she wasn&#39;t sure if she was short of breath because of her nerves. She said her oxygen level was checked and it was at 99%. She said her pulse was 101, her blood pressure was 118/76, and her blood glucose finger stick test was 128. She said she was told by the staff monitoring her, she should expect her blood glucose number to skyrocket because there is a steroid in the COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said the staff also mentioned she can expect blood glucose spikes as the COVID-19 Vaccine&#39;s steroid goes through her system. Her fingers in her left hand became itchy while she was at the nurse&#39;s station being monitored. It was a deep down itch in her left hand fingers. She said she asked for an ice pack to put on her left hand because she uses ice packs for neuropathy in her feet, and she felt an ice pack would help with the itch and burning feeling in her left hand fingers. The doctor came to look at her again and wanted to give her IV Benadryl. Then the doctor decided against the IV Benadryl because she would be too sleepy to drive home but the doctor did eventually give her an intramuscular injection of Benadryl 25mg (clarified as Diphenhydramine 25mg in a syringe) in her upper right arm. Within 5 minutes the itching in her left hand fingers calmed down, and the redness in her left arm calmed down to a pink color. She said 20 minutes later her left arm was still pink and warm. She said she was told by the doctor if her reaction moved out of the localized area of her left arm, to go to the Emergency Room, and to use an icepack, again, on her left hand. When she arrived home, her husband said she looked like she had hives and a rash going down her left arm. Her left arm was not itchy though. She clarified the blotchy red marks go in a line from the inside of her top left elbow down to her left wrist. She reported that while she was at her podiatrist&#39;s office her left arm was a solid pink. She then mentioned that when she goes out in the sun and gets overheated, she turns pink. She said from her left shoulder to left elbow was warm to the touch. She said by the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site there is a flush color around the vaccine injection site, but not on the vaccine injection site. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site is sore and her left shoulder is warm to the touch around her COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. She reported there were no blotchy, red marks on her left arm on 18Feb2021. She said her left arm is a pretty normal on 18Feb2021. The nurse who monitored her after the COVID-19 Vaccine shot said she needed to report her allergic reaction. She was told she needs to let the COVID-19 Vaccine staff know of her reaction before she gets her second COVID-19 Vaccine injection, so she can be monitored closely. She took no other treatment after she returned home from receiving her COVID-19 Vaccine. She reported she had a headache on 18Feb2021, clarifying her whole head hurts, and the headache has been persisting all day. She said she experienced tiredness, as well. She said the tiredness started on 17Feb2021 and can be partially attributed to the Diphenhydramine 25mg injection she was given. Her husband told her she looked completely wiped out, and pale when she got home after getting her COVID-19 Vaccine on 17Feb2021. She said she remembers being tired when she got home because her eyes were squinty. She reported feeling more tired on 18Feb2021 and her whole left arm and left hand are sore. She clarified her blood glucose was at 295 when she checked before bedtime of 17Feb2021, and at 185 before breakfast in the morning of 18Feb2021.

A 52-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 on left upper arm at a single dose for COVID-19 prevention. Current medical history included a lung disease called asthma and allergies, diagnosed in her late 20&#39;s; Diabetes Type 2, diagnosed about 10 years ago and High Blood pressure, diagnosed when she was in her 30&#39;s. Caller also wanted to include that she did have COVID before, she had COVID in Jul2020. Current concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) at 2 Puffs via inhalation, twice daily for asthma; Unspecified Blood Pressure Medication One pill, once daily by mouth in the morning; Unspecified Nasal Spray 1 spray in each nare, once daily via nasal inhalation; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) at 1 pill via oral, once a day for allergies; metformin at 1 pill, daily, by mouth for Diabetes Type 2. The patient stated that her place of employment did not give her the card that has the lot number on it, they said they would give it to her with her second injection. The patient did not know the dose received, just that it was the first in the series. The patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that her weight on 21Dec2020 when she got the vaccine, was 200.6, but her weight today, was 196.0 pounds. The patient received the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and as soon as she got the shot, her arm was sore like a flu shot. When she got the shot, she could not raise her arm past her shoulder without pain, but now she can raise her arm again. On Thursday, 24Dec2020, patient got a chill, and later that same night, food was not tasting right.  On 25Dec2020, the chill continued, and she had a little bit of a sore throat with a mild cough, like she needed to be clearing her throat. On 26Dec2020 morning, the patient experienced vomiting when she woke up, and the top of her stomach had a bad burning sensation, and she had diarrhea. The patient stated that while she was vomiting, she got choked on some saline and sweat ran down her face, and she had to concentrate on breathing. But the patient stated that she vomited, had diarrhea, and the burning sensation, the whole day on Saturday. The patient stated that on 27Dec2020, it calmed down, and she did not vomit at all. The patient stated that she felt like she needed to vomit, but she did not. The patient states that on Sunday, she still had the chills a little, and the top part of her stomach was still burning. The patient took some Pepto-Bismol and that helped calm down the caller&#39;s stomach. The patient stated that she could feel the Pepto-Bismol cooling her stomach off, like it had been hot, and patient stated that the top of her stomach felt swollen and gassy. The patient stated that later Sunday night, things calmed down, but she still has the burning sensation and she did not feel like she needed to vomit anymore. This morning, patient reported that she still has some burning sensation, but now, it is coming and going like labor pains. The patient stated that she did go to the bathroom once this morning and had diarrhea that was like liquid-y water. The patient stated that during all this over the last few days, each and every time that she tried to eat, she couldn&#39;t eat much because her stomach would burn more with eating. But yesterday, the patient had some fried fish and stated that the fried fish did not burn as much as the rest of the food she tried eating. The outcome of the events vomiting and the top of her stomach felt swollen and gassy was recovered on 27Dec2020, arm was sore and could not raise her arm was recovered on 26Dec2020, chills, top of her stomach had a bad burning sensation was recovering, Diarrhea/had diarrhea that was like liquid-y water was not recovered and other events was unknown.  Information about batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Vomiting and Foreign body aspiration cannot be totally excluded.

Went into ED at hospital where they gave me another breathing treatment x 2, magnesium sulfate, IV solu medrol. They were going to admit me but I decided against it with all the covid patients.

                                                About 10 to 12 minutes after the injection, I started feeling like my throat was constricted.  I felt pain in my temple and I also felt like my ears were clogged.  My tonugue was tingling and I had pain across my chest.   I had trouble swallowing and taking a deep breath.  The medical providers assessed me and since my heart was not racing and I did not have a rash all over my body, deemed I was okay.  When I went home, I noticed a rash on my chest from my collarbone to my sternum and alongside my ears on my neck.  My sister is an ER Doctor and I did a video conference with her. She had me take Benadryl.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccine nor have I ever had to take Benadryl.

This 52-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in left arm, on 07Jan2021, for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis) from 1998 and vitiligo from 1988. She was overweight. She had really no other risk factors. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced heart attack and she had a MI, then a cardiac catherization that was normal and a normal echo as well. She said it was diagnosed as a NSTEMI and not a large MI, the smaller version. These events required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 12Jan2021. MI occurred after she finished clinic and she was not standing or doing anything, just sitting and she had chest pain. Her office was right next to the ER, so she received treatment within an hour and they were able to help her. She said that her hospital couldn&#39;t do a cardiac cath, so on 11Jan2021 they moved her to an hospital which was another treatment facility. When she had her MI they gave her acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and sublingual nitroglycerin. They tested her troponin and did an EKG which was abnormal on an unspecified date in Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 troponin was increased. When they treated her with nitroglycerin and Aspirin, two hours later her EKG was normal and her troponin came down overnight on 09Jan2021, which was when they said for sure that she had a heart attack. The patient said it was very scary to have a heart attack, but thankfully there was not a lot of damage done and she was able to get treatment quickly. She did not think the event was disabling since they did not see much damage to her heart muscle, it was a near miss kind of thing. She said it was life changing in that she will now be on medication forever, she will be on at least a baby Aspirin and probably something like a statin for the rest of her life. She was recovering, it was unknown what the lasting effects may be, she felt normal but tired from her hospital stay. Heart attack resolved on 08Jan2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the event acute myocardial infarction cannot be excluded. The contributory role of the patient age and background of obesity cannot be excluded as well. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

This 52-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number=EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 07:00 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma, depression, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), known allergies included bacitracin, penicillin, levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN), metronidazole (FLAGYL), oseltamivir phosphate (TAMIFLU), Bees, Hornets. Patient took other medications in two weeks. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Patient was not pregnant. Facility type vaccine was hospital. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. On 05Jan2021 07:03, within 3 minutes patient had tingling pins in mouth tongue and throat, had hard time breathing. The nurses gave her 50 mg of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The doctors checked her O2 sat were at 91, and she had High BP 148/92. After 40 minutes (05Jan2021 07:43) after the medication her symptoms seem to go away and she could breath better. She went home and went to bed because she work night shift. She got the vaccine when she got off work, then about six hours later (05Jan2021 13:00) she had bad headache and achy all over, 12 hours later (05Jan2021 19:00) she had 102.3 temperature and took paracetamol (TYLENOL) every 4 hours and fever finally broke 26 hours later (06Jan2021 21:00). She continued to have a headache for about 5 days and severe fatigue. Adverse event resulted in life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Patient was recovered with lasting effects.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported  life threatening events including tingling pins in mouth tongue and throat, had hard time breathing, PO2 decreased, blood pressure increased, bad headache, achy all over, fever, and severe fatigue, and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, considering the plausible temporal association.

                                                Lymphadenopathy; mild fatigue; Myalgia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 52-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), intramuscular in the left arm on 12Jan2021 at 16:30 as a single dose to prevent COVID. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported and it was reported that she had no relevant medical history. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Dec2020 at 14:00. The patient did not receive any other vaccine/s on the same date as BNT162B2, did not have prior vaccination within four weeks of receiving BNT162B2, and did not experience any adverse event following prior vaccinations. The patient experienced mild fatigue and myalgia on 13Jan2021, and lymphadenopathy on 14Jan2021. Seriousness for the events was reported as serious (medically significant). The patient received her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 12Jan2021 at 16:30. She experienced mild fatigue and myalgia after 24 hours which has improved. She clarified that the mild fatigue and myalgia resolved by this morning. She felt lymphadenopathy in her lower neck and supraclavicular area. Stated it was almost fullness she can feel, there was no redness and it was not tender. She was hoping this was related to the vaccine that she got in her left upper arm. She went to the CDC and Pfizer website and saw that lymphadenopathy was mentioned but it was a small percentage. The patient declined any treatment. The events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room of Physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events fatigue and myalgia was recovered on 15Jan2021, while for the event lymphadenopathy  was not recovered. The reporter&#39;s causality assessment between the events and BNT162B2 for the events fatigue and myalgia was related, while for the event lymphadenopathy was unknown.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association and drug&#39;s safety profile, the events fatigue, myalgia and lymphadenopathy are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 52-years-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in right arm on 29Jan2021 10:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension). Concomitant medication included losartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) received in two weeks. There was no other vaccine received in four weeks. At approximately 29Jan2021 16:00, the patient started shaking and extremely cold. The patient experienced both arms as well as pectoral muscles hurt. The patient experienced very dizzy and uncomfortable like she needed to get something out her body. This lasted for over 24 hours with fever up to 102.1 Fahrenheit. All events occurred on 29Jan2021 16:00. The events resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect (pending clarification). No treatment received for the events. The patient was no pregnant. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Enlargened lymph node in mouth; headache in temples; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 52-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: E13302) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 11Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included lower back pain. Concomitant medications: patient received medications two weeks prior to vaccination. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 22Dec2020 at 1pm (lot/batch number: El0140) in left arm. Patient reported that after 2 days (13Jan2021), at around 3pm she got a headache in her temples that would not go away. She went to the urgent care Covid test done which was negative. Had ER visit for headache then with continued headache, then 2 weeks later another ER visit. She also had enlarged lymph node in mouth that was found 2 days ago (03Feb2021). Patient visited ER for the events. As treatment, patient was given Rocephin IV, migraine cocktail, morphine and Dilad. The patient underwent lab tests which included Nasal swab: negative on 16Jan2021 (Rapid test). Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19. Outcome of the events was not recovered.    No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

They kept me for 2 hours. Started to resolve in those two hours but didn&#39;t go away completely. By evening it was mostly returned to normal.

The back pain and cough was almost a month now (as of 23Feb2021). She reported no matter what she did she did not get it to go away. She did a zoom call with her doctor because of COVID symptoms and because she took vaccine. She took 1000mg of Tylenol prior to receiving both doses and thought maybe it wouldn&#39;t hurt and would keep her from getting a fever. She has been taking 1000mg Tylenol three times a day and now she was taking it two times a day.  She used Tylenol and generic, SunMark Acetaminophen (Lot number: OLE2349B, expiry: Sep2022). Regarding seriousness of headache, made a different in the vision. It was throbbing. for back pain: it was seven out of 10. It was disabling. She had to miss work and could barely walk across the floor. for arm pain at the injection area: gripping was not easy and moving her arm was painful. She is left handed. Heat worked better than ice. Ice made things worse. for cough: it had not been disabling. it was irritating because it had been almost 30 days.  She knows it was different than the COVID cough because it was moist and when she had COVID it was a dry cough. Regarding seriousness of nausea and vomiting: it was debilitating and she couldn&#39;t go anywhere because she was throwing up with every move she made. The pain made it worse. The reporter assessed moist cough, nausea and vomiting, arm pain at the injection area were related to suspect vaccine. No investigation assessment performed. Outcome of fever, inside of her eyes were on fire, pain in the arm at the injection site was resolved. Outcome of back pain, moist cough was not resolved. Outcome of spine pain was resolving. Outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the back pain and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.

A 53-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 28Dec2020 13:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. She has had the Coronavirus before and wanted to know if previously having the virus might make her side effects worse.  She had COVID 19. She got her positive result on 06Aug2020. Her husband had it too. She knows what it is like. She didn&#39;t have to go to the hospital, but she had a severe enough case. She had the fever, dry cough, body aches, nausea, and poops. She has been getting body aches after having COVID really intense. She gets tired very easily. She had fibromyalgia was diagnosed more than 10 years ago and ongoing, before the year 2000; acid reflux was diagnosed five or six years ago; high blood pressure was diagnosed back in 2007; high cholesterol; wheezing for a couple of years and depression. The patient was also taking a water pill. Concomitant medication included omeprazole ongoing for acid reflux, hydrochlorothiazide (HYDROCHLOROTH, 25 mg) ongoing, losartan 100 mg ongoing, desvenlafaxine 75 mg ongoing for depression, montelukast 10 mg ongoing for wheezing, atorvastatin calcium ongoing for cholesterol.  When asked for the lot number the patient said that she thinks it is EL1284 but it could possibly be ELI284. On 28Dec2020, the patient felt really tired, has a sore arm with chills, fever and body aches. The same day she got the vaccine she had felt fine. She came home and did a few things. She sat down for a minute and then it was like wham. She told her husband she was done. She went to sleep fast and slept for a couple of hours. She went to work the next morning and her arm was sore to touch and to lift it up. Sometimes when you get the flu shot it is like that too.  She does not have any red marks where it was injected. She only knows where it was because it hurt to touch. She got really tired at work about 11:30AM. Her body started aching. She was being tested twice a week for Corona COVID. She had just been tested on 28Dec2020 morning before the vaccination and was negative. On an unspecified in Dec2020, she was freezing and shaking. She cannot get warm. It was like that for a couple of hours. Usually her temperature runs low. It was up to 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit which is high for her because she usually is on the lower end. She felt really ugh.The symptoms after the vaccine reminded her of when she had COVID. She had a low fever and body aches and felt terrible. Her boss wanted to know if she had the flu. The patient does not think so because it would be ironic the day after she gets the shot. She was assuming it was the side effects from this. She further clarified wham as that she was really tired and it came over her really quick. She sat in the chair and got a blanket. Her husband said she was snoring bad (28Dec2020). Two hours later the dogs woke her up and she thought it was the middle of the night. It wasn&#39;t it was early. On unspecified date in Dec2020, she had a bout and her body started aching. A day after, she does not feel that bad, does not have fever and her body was not aching. That night when she got home she could not sleep on her arm because it was sore. The next day was when it was hard to lift it. She had the injection in the right arm, which is the arm she uses. It was still sore to touch. She has fibromyalgia. She is not sure if that is why she is aching. She is not sure if that kicked it in high gear. The vaccine was administered in a Long Term Care Center. The patient has not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The events did not result to emergency room nor physician visit.

A 53-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EU9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 08:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypothyroidism and chronic low back pain.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), baclofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and etodolac (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took miconazole nitrate (MONISTAT) on unknown dates for an unknown indication and experienced drug allergy. On 31Dec2020 at 10:00, the patient started with a red raised rash under her arms and waistline and as the day progressed the rash turned hot to touch with raised red large hives all over her body including her face/head. By 23:00 on 31Dec2020, the patient had already taken 3 doses of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) which was not effective. Then, later on 31Dec2020, shortness of breath started with numbness in the hands/feet/chest area. Her daughter took her to the emergency room. She was started on intravenous diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, and famotidine (PEPCID). The medications took time to work but they did resolve her shortness of breath and the hives subsided to mild redness.  She was sent home and given the following medications to take: diphenhydramine 50 mg every 4 hours, methylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSE PAK), cetirizine (ZYRTEC) daily, and famotidine (PEPCID) daily. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the red rash, rash was hot to touch, shortness of breath, and numbness, were reported as recovered with lasting effects; while that of the hives was recovering as they still flared up if she did not take the medications every 4 hours. The reporter assessed all the events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported shortness of breath together with red rash was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE together with rash was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Lower back at kidney sites are so painful. Weakness. No energy to lift up arms or legs. Have difficult to get up and get out of bed to get medicine or food. So sleepy, maybe because Tylenol 500mg q4h to help for pain but reduce just little from 10 down to 8 for a short time enough to get out of bed to get something.  Ice pack at armpit, heat pat at lower back but just reduce the pain from 10 down to 9 only. No appetite. Eat lentil and rice porridge but indigestible and have to take Pepcid. All symptoms prolong until Friday 1/15/2021 around 1pm. I pushed myself hard to get up to drive to employee health for testing which I missed on Thursday due to unable to get up. After that the symptoms down to moderate that I able to report CDC. I wonder why 2 dose is so horrible to me.

                                                Patient reported chest tightness (1-2 on 0-10 pain scale) and left arm tingling approximately 10 minutes after receiving the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient reported symptoms felt similar to times when she had exposure to cats or after exercising. She denies any previous treatments for anaphylaxis or any previous severe reactions. Vital signs at time of initial assessment were BP 147/100, pulse 80, O2 Sat 99% on room air.  Patient was observed for 50 minutes and chest tightness/arm tingling symptoms resolved. Patient did also develop a dry &#34;tickly&#34; cough about 60 minutes post vaccination.  Patient was administered albuterol 2 puffs via MDI and reported improvement of cough. She again reported the cough to be similar to the type of cough she had gotten when exposed to cats. No further treatment needed. Patient stable and released to go home.

                                                On 01/01/21, I experienced a vaso vagal syncope episode and actually passed out and injured my upper back and right side of rib cage.  I am a nurse and was looking up the required reporting and saw this as a reportable event, and even though it indicates within 7 days, I thought it might be worth reporting.  I have never passed out like that before.

                                                Within 15 mins of the inj. started feel fuzzy, under conscious sedation, warm sensation going up the right arm and neck and right ear. The left arm felt like battery acid, hurt super bad. Felt like an outer body experience. Was given Benadryl.  Was having a problem clearing her throat. Felt weird by her bellybutton, felt like she had on a corset on. Rash developed at sternum and bellybutton. Went over to her ER at work. The knee to the hip felt like she had cement on them. Her tongue started to swell. She was wheeled up to tramum2. She blackout at some point.  Her body was doing one thing and her mind another. She had EpiPen stat.  Right was twitching like Parkinson&#39;s.  After 1 1/2 she started feeling a little better. 69/43 bp recorded. The next few days she felt like she had Mono.

The patient explained she felt better today so she went to work and spoke to her supervisor who told her it was better to take a test for COVID. It was mentioned she looked pale and it was better for her to have a test just in case. The patient reported that she knows a bit about vaccines and the proteins and RNA. Since it has been less than 72 hours since she had the second dose, would she test positive if she had a COVID test. No treatment after the doses. Patient states she has no had any testing done at this point. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of event so hungry. The event fever recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The outcome of the events chills, anorexia, headache, discomfort in her chest and myalgia/muscle pain, leg pain, looked pale, and was so hungry was unknown.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 53-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization as COVID-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed more than three years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She had no other vaccines on the same day as her COVID vaccine. The patient had the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 29Dec2020, and since then she has contracted COVID, and tested positive for it on 07Jan2021 with symptoms. She asked if she still can get the second shot on the 21st day following her first dose. When she got the vaccine, she was fine, just had a sore arm. A couple days before 07Jan2021, she developed allergy symptoms, and so on the 7th (07Jan2021), she went to get tested, and it was positive. She was 235 pounds, but since getting COVID on Jan2021, she is now 224 pounds. She reported that she started to have allergy like symptoms on maybe 05Jan2021, and on the 7th she went to get tested for COVID, because she had started feeling her chest tighten, and congestion, and her back was hurting, and she has a history of asthma, so she wanted to be seen. She confirmed that on 07Jan2021, she had a Rapid test for COVID, and the results came back the same day, as Positive. She was told that she should also have a 48-hour test, so she had that performed as well, and that one also came back positive, but she knew it would, because by then she had lost her taste and smell. The patient is scheduled for her 2nd dose 19Jan2021. She was wanting to know if she can still get the 2nd dose. She was told she needed to wait 30 days from her positive diagnosis before she could get the 2nd dose. She added that she will still be in isolation when her 2nd dose is due. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 53-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 17:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (HTN) and asthma, both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included first dose of PFIZER BIONTECH COVID 19 VACCINE on 28Dec2020 at 01:15 PM (lot number: EL1284) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization given when the patient was 53 years old. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks prior to covid vaccine. She had known allergies which were not specified. She was not pregnant. The patient experienced chest tightness, wheezing, throat swelling, tongue tingling and lip numbness, all on 18Jan2021 at 05:45 PM with outcome of recovering. The events resulted to Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for all events included DECADRON and Benadryl script for Epipen. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. She was tested for covid post vaccination through nasal swab on 20Jan2021 with pending result.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of chest tightness, wheezing, throat swelling, tongue tingling and lip numbness  due to temporal relationship.  However,  the chest tightness, wheezing may possibly be associated with the patient&#39;s history of asthma. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 53-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 06Jan2021 (at the age of 53-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient experienced electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormal and large bruise on right buttock/right thigh/right arm on 08Jan2021; numbness and tingling in right thumb on 10Jan2021; reddened area with bruising with nodule on 26Jan2021; chest discomfort and heart attack in Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: Two days later after vaccination, she noticed bruising on various parts of body. The first bruise she noticed on the 08Jan2021. It was probably about 3.5 inches in length 2 inches in width. The patient stated that it did not necessarily have a shape. She had a large bruise on her right buttock. Two days later, she noticed a similar in size bruise on the front of her right thigh. Then a couple days later, she noticed three quarter size bruises on her right arm (two on the inner part of arm, and one on the outer, both on upper arm). The very next day, she developed the same sizing bruise. It was about the same size on her left upper arm. There were no other side effects besides the bruising. There was no itching or redness, no skin, respiratory, or neurological issues. The day before her second dose, on 26Jan2021, she noticed a 4 inch reddened area with a two centimeter nodule inside that bruise. The patient stated that the initial bruises began to heal. They are not as dark as they were. They were reported to have started out red and then turned black and blue. The patient also had numbness and tingling in her right thumb. She was having some chest discomfort after the initial vaccination that is still ongoing. The chest discomfort prompted her to go to urgent care on 08Jan2021, where she had an abnormal EKG on 08Jan2021. The patient was told to follow up with a cardiologist. The patient saw the cardiologist on 25Jan2021, where he did an EKG and ECHO. The EKG was abnormal and ECHO with unknown results on 25Jan2021, but the doctor was unable to determine when the heart attack occurred. The cardiologist also ran labs: a troponin to see if anything was acutely going on, and a D Dimer to evaluate her clotting factors; both were negative on 25Jan2021. The cardiologist recommended a computerised tomogram (CT) scan, which was still scheduled at the time of report. The clinical outcome of large bruise on right buttock/right thigh/right arm, chest discomfort, numbness and tingling in right thumb, and reddened area with bruising with nodule was not recovered and of heart attack and EKG abnormal was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.

She started with the headache initially then the chills, and nausea, and then lymph node. Her lymph nodes were still swollen. She informed was due to get the &#34;booster&#34; vaccine this Thursday (28Jan2021) and she just wanted to call and see if she should still go and get the booster vaccine with the swollen lymph nodes. She added she did get a test for the COVID this past Thursday (21Jan2021), because of the symptoms, and it was negative.

At the time of the report she had not recovered from the adverse events headache, chills, nausea and swollen lymph node and she did not receive any treatment for these.

Subsided for 6 hours and then 6:30 that evening it returned at 100.7. Again 6 hours later, fever was 100.4.  Christmas day, still had fever around 100. Then again that afternoon. Lymph node swelling underneath the arm. The site of the injection I had a large knot. Very swollen, small bruise, hot, and red. No streaking or red lines. Lymph node underneath the arm was about the size of a ping pong. I did not want to go to the ER. I called the nurse line and was triaged over the phone. I was instructed to take BP and pulse and gave numbers over the phone. BP was a little elevated, but nothing to extreme. I pretty much stayed laying down. It sucked the life out of me. I used hot compress and cold compress on site of the injection. It was late Saturday evening when I decided to see a change in the size of the lymph node. By Sunday, the 27th, there was no fever. Not even on Saturday. By Sunday, the lymph node had subsided as well.  I did get a headache, but it was like a nagging headache. My left shoulder in the muscle area towards the neck area, I had soreness.

The concomitant product was none. The patient previously took flu vaccine and experienced preservative made neck twitch and joint sores. Yesterday the patient got the COVID Vaccine and had a pretty significant adverse event. She was calling to report it and to see if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient was also a licensed speech pathologist. She received the vaccine yesterday at 2:28 PM. She was allergic to Sulfa drugs and would get shortness of breath, so they wanted her to wait 30 minutes for monitoring. She was feeling giddy on 30Dec2020, but she ran into a friend that she had not seen before quarantine, so they were talking. It was exciting. After her 30 minutes she went to her car and felt a little funny. She thought she was hungry so she ate half a banana and had some water. She had an appointment to get to so she started to drive off, and by the time she got to the interstate she was feeling funny. She got on her left side, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face on 30Dec2020. This was like the precursor. Then on 30Dec2020 her face started to go numb. It felt like a dental block you would get with Lidocaine. It went from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips. It was midline on the left side. She was breathing fine. She was trying to figure out if she should pull over or call(Number), but her airway did not close up. Her upper esophageal sphincter got tight and felt funny like she was going to throw up. She drove to the hospital close to her house which is affiliated with where she got the vaccine. She normally had primary tremors, small to where people do not notice. But her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs on 30Dec2020. She looked like a bobble head. But she could still breath. They took her right in and they did an EKG to make sure it was not her heart. Her blood pressure was up on 30Dec2020, she assumes for being stressed. They monitored her. They gave her Pepcid and Benadryl. She did not want any nausea medications. She stayed for about 2 hours and slept some from the Benadryl. Her face slowly became less numb. The numbness went away started from her lips and outward to her check and temple area. Then it just felt funny. When she touched it, which she never lost sensation, it was like, whose face is this? It was strange. She is not numb anymore. It took a while for it to go away, and it still felt weird. When she woke up this morning it was completely gone. She had recovered completely from all of these things. The only thing she has now was some transient nausea. It was very mild. It comes and goes. It had improved. She had not taken anything for it.  The events Feeling funny, her face started to go numb, upper esophageal sphincter got tight, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, were all assessed as Medically significant. The outcome of the event Nausea was recovering, the events Felt giddy, blood pressure was up, Stress was recovered on 31Dec2020, the other events were recovered on 30Dec2020.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that the events Feeling funny, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Face started to go numb from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips, upper esophageal sphincter got tight , whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, Nausea, were related to the product BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events.

Next morning the palpitations and fatigue went away but I start with a rash and very itchy and noticed my face swelling up. I took some prednisone I had home and Benadryl and went to the ER. They monitored me and medicated me and told me to keep with the Benadryl. On the 24th I started with the rash and on the 26th no more rash. My second dose is scheduled on the 13th and I will see my PCP on the 12th to decide if I should have the second dose. I am not allergic to anything and thought I would die on 12/24. I was swelling up in less than a minute after I woke up it was awful. I also have a consultation with an allergist on Tuesday  before the vaccine.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 08Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 54-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in deltoid left on 29Dec2020 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing sleep apnoea (diagnosed about 3-4 years ago, wear her CPAP religiously), Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, and chronic low vitamin d (lack of sunlight). Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from 2016 and ongoing for Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, ergocalciferol (VIT D) from 2018 for chronic low vitamin d; lack of sunlight (She did not take it religiously, but was supposed to take it everyday). At 10:30 AM (29Dec2020), she started to get cold and shake. She thought that this was insane and it was in her head. It became so severe she could not use her computer her hands were shaking so hard. She went back up to where they were giving vaccines, they took her temperature and it was 100. It had been normal the morning before she got the vaccine. Her heart rate was elevated at 100. They put a blanket on her and said they wanted to watch her for 15 minutes. In that time her fever went to 101 and her heart rate was 110. They took her to the ER. She was there for 5 hours. Her heart rate went to the high 120s. They did a 12 lead EKG. Her temperature had gone to 102.6, which was the highest. They gave her a liter of Normal Saline. She also had a headache, backache, and felt nauseated. The liter of fluid helped, no doubt. She was not admitted. She was wiped out the next day (30Dec2020) with aches and pains still. Their concern was they said they did not give her epinephrine because her heart was too high. She had no breathing issues. Just extreme cold. At one point she had woke up in the ER (29 or 30Dec2020) and her chest was hurting, she knows from her heart rate being too fast. She was so cold. She had on 6 blankets. The next day (30Dec2020) she still had the aches and pains, she was tired, and had brain fog. It all went away on 30Dec2020. She had nothing after that. What scared her was the heart rhythm. The ER doctor says its not great, but felt that getting the second dose was better than her having COVID. The Electrophysiologist she saw, said she was unsure if she should get the second dose. The hospital said that for this next dose, they would give her the injection, wait 15 minutes, then send her home, expecting that she would have the same thing happen. When after the first dose, she was in the ER on a 12 lead EKG with an intravenous (IV). She had no arm pain the whole time. The reporter assessed all events related. She felt fine prior, walking in to get the vaccine. But she was much better the next day and recovered completely. She was just worried about the second dose. The outcome of events was recovered on 30Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I waited for 30 minutes; I walked to my car and didn&#39;t feel well; I thought maybe I was hungry I ate 1/2 banana and drank some water. I started to drive home.  It felt like a huge cold railroad spike was being driven up the top of my shoulder to my neck, it was a cold sensation anteriorly and posteriorly on my neck.  Then my face (left side) started to go numb, it started just about the top of my left ear and went all the way to my lips. It stopped midline.  It felt like a dental block.  I could still swallow and breathe.  I started shaking, felt nausea, my upper esophageal sphincter started to spasm.  I kept checking my tongue and airway to see if I should pull over and call 911.  I drove to the ER.  My left side of face was numb, I was trembling, tremoring.  They gave me small dose of IV Bendadryl (12.5 mg) and Pepcid, I slowly started to feel better and the feeling came back to my face moving from midline lip to cheek.  It still felt &#34;funny&#34; but much better.  I was in the ER for around 2 hours. I have had more tremoring since my vaccine in my neck and hand (I do have primary essential tremors but it is tremoring much more now) and more neck pain (could be due to the increased tremors)

That same night I had a mild fever, but I am not concerned by this. Had some mild vertigo after the first vaccination (lot EH9899) but it only lasted 48 hrs.

RR 36&#43; O2 sat stayed at 93 or above with ambulation. HR in supine position 70 w/in 10-15 seconds of ambulation greater than 105. On day 6 post injection, with bagging up a bag of garbage (bending over and picking things up with a spilt can) I had to sit down I was that SOB. HR 130 on pulse ox - O2 sat. 94-95.  Day 7 post injection - ER work up for PE - negative, chf evaluation - negative. no pneumonia or cardiomegaly on CTA. CBC all w/in normal limits except on diff - lymph 0.5 above normal range only. CMP ok as well. BMP and trops normal. Day 9 diffuse itchy rash has developed, even worse now on day 10. Raised, blanching, papules - no pustules/vesicles noted. Trunk presentation spreading to extremities.  leg signifiant more populated than arms. Rash now on tops and bottoms of feet.  Minimal spots on dorsal hands and none on palms. Extremely itchy.   &#43; Celiac patient (Dx- genetically 7-8 years ago, symptoms for over 10) and &#43; Hashimotos patient (29 years). No recent gluten exposure resulting in GI response. (I can get bowel incontinence with cross contamination. ) I&#39;m taking Synthroid as prescribed.  Since I&#39;m in the CD8 peak days (9-11)- can this just be some type of autoimmune storm since it was a viral vaccine? No history of any problems with my yearly influenza vaccine.

My potassium was very low ? 3.3. My TSH was 0.05; glucose 108;auto absol basos 0.1. Other results were normal. They told me the reaction was due to my low potassium and TSH levels.

I was very fatigued for 2  1/2 days.  Arm was a little sore.

She notified the nursing counter who notified me.  Patient was A&amp;Ox3 upon my arrival and able to speak in full sentences.  Heart rate was noted to be 105 bpm.  50mg oral Benadryl was administered and patient was monitored for 25 minutes.  Heart rate improved as did patient&#39;s work of breathing, chest tightness, and her dizziness subsided completely.  Her final heart rate at time of discharge was 93 bpm and patient was able to ambulate under own power to depart the site.  She was escorted to her husband&#39;s vehicle and he received instructions to take her to the hospital to fill her epi-pen prescription which was placed at the time of the incident as well as reasons to use the epi-pen and report to ED if needed.

                                                I had my 2nd does of the Pfizer vaccine on February 27, 2021.  The next morning  I awoke with a very bad headache.  I took and Advil.  My husband was making breakfast.  I came downstairs, ate, had a cup of coffee, then got a glass of water and an ice pack and sat on a recliner in the living room.  I don&#39;t remember much of the rest.  It was like a dream.  My husband said I let out a yell, my arms flailed and my eyes were very strange.  I lost muscle strength in my lift side mimicking a stroke.  He called 911.  I was taken to Emergency facility where I gained consciousness.  I was then transferred to Hospital.  So far every test has come back negative.  I have an EEG scheduled for this Thursday.

A 54-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at arm left on 28Jan2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 54-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib), depression, aortic stenosis and allergy to sulfa, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included losartan, HCTZ, sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), vitamin D3, magnesium and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12).  The patient previously took LEVOQUIN and prednisone and experienced allergies. On 02Feb2021 at 08:00, the patient experienced increased AFib episodes, joint ache esp. to left knee with pain and headache.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 (nasal swab) test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included acupuncture and the events required physician office visit. The patient outcome of the event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event atrial fibrillation is related to BNT162B2.  The event only occurred 4 days after vaccination.  And the patient had underlying atrial fibrillation, which is considered the most likely cause of the reported event.

When the drink did not help she was given 12.5mg of diphenhydramine at 4:57pm. It was recommended and offered for her to take 25mg of diphenhydramine but patient stated it made her too drowsy. After a few minutes, the patient stated it felt like her throat was tightening so she was given the other 12.5mg of diphenhydramine given at 5:03pm. She stated her heart was racing and her head was pounding. Her blood pressure was 164/72 and pulse 117. She stated her chest was feeling tight and at 5:11 an EpiPen was administered and call to 911.

                                                Vaccine administered at 11:15 AM.  At 12:00 pm the top of my head became very hot, my face felt hot and red with raised rash, my scalp became very itchy, my heart felt like it was beating out of my chest and I had pounding in both ears.  My bilateral forearms began to itch and then developed hives.  I notified my Supervisor that I was having a reaction.  I was checked in to ER (where I am an RN).  My blood pressure was elevated 180&#39;s systolic and my heart rate was 180BPM and short of breath.  An IV was started and I was given Normal Saline Bolus, Solu-medrol 125MG and Benadryl 25MG IV.  Prior to medications, my throat felt itchy and &#34;tight&#34; but resolved once medication given.  The itching and hives continued to spread to my upper back, neck, bilateral feet and behind my bilateral knees.  After approximately 1 1/2 hrs itching and hives continued then I was given Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25mg PO which after 40 minutes my itching and hives resolved.  I was later discharged home with a prescription of Methylprednisolone 4MG dose pack.  Symptoms resolved until approximately 1:30 am on 5/7/2021 when I awoke to pounding in my ears and the feeling once again my heart was beating out of my chest.  My heart rate was 132BPM, I became hot and diaphoretic,  short of breath.  My scalp felt it was on fire and then I broke out in hives.  I immediately took Prednisone, benadryl and pepcid.  I took a cool shower, got dressed and drove to the hospital down the road and sat in the parking lot just in case my throat became itchy and tight (which it did not).  The hives and itching began to resolve after an hour.  My heart rate went back to 67BPM and shortness of breath resolved as well.  I called Employee Health at hospital and made a report of symptoms.

The lymph node was about the size of a large gumball.  The next day I started having pain in the lymph nodes of my arm pit on the right side.  The symptoms are still present six days later and I now have some swollen and tender lymph nodes in the antecubital area of the same arm.  I am scheduled to get my second dose on 1/21/21.  I have not had any other side affects that I know of other than feeling a little tired and mild headache on and off but that didn&#39;t seem unusual for me.  The lymph node in my neck seems to be getting a little smaller as of today 1/13/21.

A 55-year-old female patient received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mild hypertension and arthritis. The patient was not pregnant. No Covid prior vaccination, no Covid tested post vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included estradiol, norethisterone acetate (COMBIPATCH), meloxicam, propanol. The patient previously received 1st dose of BNT162B2 in left arm on 17Dec2020 15:45 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced egg sized lymphadenopathy under right arm 36 hours after 2D injection (08Jan2021 03:00), after flu symptoms of muscle and joint aches, arm pain and swelling at 20 hours (07Jan2021 12:00). No treatment received for the events. The outcome of events was not recovered. This case was reported as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of lymphadenopathy. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I began to experience a dry throat about 10 minutes after injection - I attributed it to needing a drink. My throat then felt a bit warm and I thought this was due to thirst as well. I left the monitoring area. I was walking to my vehicle and began to feel more of a warm sensation in my throat and not into my upper chest. About 5 minutes after this took place my face became flush and began tingling and feeling sunburned and tight - I looked in the mirror and my cheeks and nose and chin were red and felt extremely warm - I did not have facial swelling that i noticed buy my face felt tingly and like it was sunburned - my eye felt puffy but did not look puffy enough to notice in the mirror. Approximately 30-35 minutes after the immunization,  I took 50mg of Benadryl and 1300mg of Tylenol. I felt my symptoms begin to improve  about 25-30 minutes after taking the medication - my throat and chest were not as warm.  the facial flushing lasted about an hour or hour and a half.   The morning after my immunization I did have a scratchy throat - I did not take any further medication - by the afternoon - this is almost gone - still just a little scratchy.

                                                Patient became lightheaded at approximately 11:10 a.m. which was 9 minutes after administration of the vaccine.  The patient had expressed some anxiety about receiving the vaccine but wanted to receive it. The patient complained of lightheadedness and we lowered her to the floor with feet elevated. Her blood pressure had lowered significantly (60/40 approximately). Patient began to feel better and sat back in her chair. She again began to complain of lightheadedness and was lowered to the floor with feet elevated once more. Patients stayed in this position for several minutes. When her blood pressure was rechecked, it had risen back to 118/78. Patient felt much better and also ate some crackers and drank some water. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was checked a final time in a seated position after approximately 20 minutes and her blood pressure was 118/82. Patient reported having an event like this 36 years ago after her first visit to an OB/GYN and was similarly nervous that day. Patient was counseled extensively on preventing future lightheadedness and signs of any vaccine related adverse event. After approximately 45 minutes of observation from the event, patient was driven home by her husband.

Waking overnight last night (AM of 1/16/21) with right hand numbness that lasted for some time.  Extreme, extreme fatigue- the worst lasted 48 hours post vaccination.  Still continuing but not as severe as the first 48 hours. Body aches, particularly (but not only)  right hip and knee that have arthritis- worst sx ~ 36 hours post vaccination.  Ongoing intermittently. Heart palpitations but unable to determine if related to vaccination. Chest pain, mid-left sternal, intermittent, ongoing.  More of a muscular pain/discomfort.  Note: for 1st injection had some similar &#34;side effects&#34; but also some that were different.

                                                Heart fluttering; chest pressure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 55-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot number: EK5730; expiration date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at hospital on 31Dec2020 10:00 at at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies with sulfa. The patient is not pregnant. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took clarithromycin (BIAXIN), metronidazole benzoate (FLAGYL), and sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIM), and all but experienced allergies (reported as &#34;known allergies: Biaxin, Flagyl, sulfa, Bactrim&#34;). No COVID prior to vaccination and no COVID tested post vaccination. The patient experienced heart fluttering and chest pressure on 04Jan2021. There was no treatment received for the reported events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal relationship between the reported heart fluttering and the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Surgery was in 2017 and never had problems and they stated heart was compromised and maybe this is your reaction to the vaccine.

A 55-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and asthma, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Known allergies reported: drug intolerances with nausea/vomiting to Opiates, TRULICITY, sulfa antibiotics. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The vaccine was administered at Hospital Facility.  It was unknown If other vaccine were administered in four weeks. The patient did not experience COVID prior vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination on 01Jan2021 and was negative. On 31Dec2020 within minutes of vaccination the patient experienced shortness of breath, headache and tinnitus. The events required visit to Physician Office and Emergency Room. The patient was admitted to hospital for 7 days. Therapeutic measures taken as a result of the events included epinephrine without benefit, prednisone course but tinnitus remained about 12 days since vaccination, corticosteroids, and H1 and H2 antagonists.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test post vaccination (Nasal Swab) on 01Jan2021 with negative result. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events dyspnea, headache and tinnitus cannot be excluded.

A 55-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 08Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included urinary tract infection (UTI) from 06Jan2021 and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), in the left upper arm with no issues. At first, she just had a sore arm on 08Jan2021. Then this morning, on 13Jan2021, she was having chills, enlarged lymph nodes, body aches in her back and shoulders, and a fever of 99.6. It is low grade but does not take much. She has been checking her temperature every 4 hours and it is not any different. She was taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) for a few days to ward anything off. Today (13Jan2021), she laid off the paracetamol to see if she really did have a fever. She did not want to mask it. So, she is taking paracetamol for that off and on. She talked to one person who said the symptoms should last 1-2 days. Then another person said they could last up to a week. She hopes that it is related to the vaccine. She will be mad if she gets COVID after doing all of this. Outcome of the sore arm was recovered on 09Jan2021 and of the remaining events was not recovered.

A 55-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL8982, unknown expiration), via injection once to right arm on 14Jan2021 at a single dose as she is eligible with first tier for vaccination.  Medical history and concomitant medications reported as none. The patient reported that she received the first dose of COVID vaccine on 14Jan2021 (Thursday). The next day (15Jan2021), her arm was sore for 24 hours after the shot, and she didn&#39;t have any side effects over the weekend. On 19Jan2021, Tuesday, she started having constant headache, and was experiencing problems with gas and bloating, it is very rare for her to have this issue, and it was building the last of couple days, she was uncomfortable and was taking over the counter medication for relief. She was keeping the headaches at bay with generic ibuprofen (lot: S200378, expiry: Mar2023), but if she missed a dose or is feeling better and doesn&#39;t take, it is coming back, it is consistent. Gas and bloating are primarily after eating, on Wednesday, after 24 hours it was ridiculous. She got some generic Extra Strength Gas Relief one tablet after eating (lot: 75257, expiry: Jun2022), and it was giving her some relief until early this morning. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the gas and bloating was worse. Last night, her entire chest, she wanted to burp so bad, but couldn&#39;t because it really hurt, and it took a while for the next tablet to kick in and give relief, she was like where is this coming from, she didn&#39;t know it could build up so much. On 22Jan2021, she had a terrible diarrhea.  Diarrhea was painful and intense, she took generic Pepto Bismol 1-2 tablets, and she took 4, The first time she woke up at 04:30 AM and at 7 another wave hit her, so she took another two tablets. Right now, she is feeling okay, but the gas is building up, her chest is filling, she is uncomfortable. The patient asked if these are reported side effects.  She works in a dental office, and the doctor is knowledgeable and sensitive to COVID, and even though those symptoms are not listed as side effects on the information sheet, the doctor said they are symptoms of COVID, and even though those symptoms are not listed as side effects on the information sheet, the doctor said they are symptoms of COVID, are these side effects or may she have COVID, though she doesn&#39;t know who she could have gotten COVID from. Out of protection for patients at dental clinic, the HCP at clinic wants her to get the COVID test as he believes it could be COVID and not side effect of the vaccine. She doesn&#39;t want to quarantine for nothing if it is just side effects of the vaccine. She will be getting rapid diagnostic for COVID and not the antibody test. She thinks she should get tested, but there is no testing appointment available until tomorrow, and she does not want to self-quarantine needlessly, she will live through it, she is happy to get the test, but she doesn&#39;t want to lose 2 weeks of pay if others are reporting the same side effects. She was happy to get the vaccine. The patient recovered from the event arm sore on 16Jan2021; not yet recovered from events constant headache, gas, and bloating; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

                                                1st vaccine: Approximately 24 hours after vaccine, I developed chills with fever of 100.2, fatigue, total body/muscle/joint aches, migraine headache, nausea, heart palpitations, as well as very sore, swollen arm. Had to spend the day in bed. Most symptoms relieved by the next 24 hours except arm pain and fatigue. 2nd vaccine: Similar, but worse symptoms developed approximately 12 hours after vaccine. All of the aforementioned symptoms, but fever of 101.4 and arm wasn&#39;t quite as sore. As above, had to spend a day in bed.

Approximately 2.5hrs later developed generalized muscle aches, tired, chills.  Next morning muscle aches were less, new headache and dizziness. took Tylenol which helped, about 5 hrs later symptoms worsened, improved with sleep and Tylenol.   Awoke this morning with some chest pain similar to initial response, some headache and dizziness, improved with Tylenol,  now returning (noon).  occasionally feels like I need to take a deep breath.  I believe its mostly muscular pain gets a little worse with deep breathing.  Sent home from work day of vaccine, worked partial days next 2 days

                                                A few days after the vaccine I began to have a cough about mid morning which changed to SOB.  Covid test on 12/27 which was neg. I went to work on 12/28 but woke up 12/29 with a low grade fever and felt like my throat was on fire.   so on the 29th I went and got a Strep and flu test which were negative.  I was feeling so bad so on the 6th of Jan do I went to the stand alone ER and got a chest xray and CT scan which revealed I did have pnemonia.  I went back home  but was feeling worse and was taken to and admitted in hospital for 2 days.  Initially I was admitted into the COVID unit but never was diagnosed COVID positive so I was moved off the COVID unit.  I was given albuterol pills to try to help with the symptoms but didnt work causing me to have to be admitted and was given several doses of steorid and other antibioics and had to use O2 at night because my stats kept falling.

Her husband and I walked her over to the cot and medical treatment area. Her pulse felt thready and weak while walking and her gait was unsteady. As soon as she sat, then lay on the cot she lost consciousness and did not respond to verbal or noxious stimuli over the next few minutes. I gave her one dose of an epi-pen into her left mid outer thigh but she still did not regain consciousness so we called a &#34;Rapid Response code&#34; for transport to the E.R. for further treatment and stabilization.

A 56-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular (IM) in right deltoid on 07Jan2021 15:30 at second single dose for preventative. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took H1N1 flut shot in 2015 or 2016 for immunisation and experienced muscle stiffness and fatigue, first dose bnt162b2, via IM in left deltoid for preventative on 18Dec2020 at 18:00 and patient was tender in her left arm, the first shot hurt way more and hurt all over the whole arm, it was throbbing. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. No prior other vaccinations administered within 4 weeks. The patient took the second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Thursday 07Jan2021 at 15:30. She called employee health and was advised to call Pfizer to report side effects since she is not feeling good. She had never had the covid diagnosis. On Friday (08Jan2021) she worked all day and felt arm soreness and sinus congestion but nothing out of the ordinary. The patient reported her right arm was still tender to touch, if she rotated her arm she can feel that she had the shot and she was still tender in her left arm from the first shot. The first shot hurt way more and hurt all over the whole arm, it was throbbing. On 08Jan2021 evening she felt really lightheaded, she thought maybe it was her sinuses since it is dry due to winter. She felt like a truck hit her. She had a low grade headache. On 09Jan2021, she felt a little nauseous, queasy, no vomiting. On Saturday (09Jan2021) she had a low grade temp of 100.3 degrees F. She had the chills and shakes on Saturday and most of yesterday. She got up today (reported on 12Jan2020) at 5:30 am, she checked her temperature and it was 97.2 after the shower, an hour later it was 98 degrees F. She felt like she had to keep clearing her throat, her chest felt a bit tight which started Friday evening, the chest tightness was not terrible but it was there. She was not wheezing but when she took a deep breath she felt a little like a wheeze and she had to cough, she had a scratchy throat on 09Jan2020. She stayed home from work yesterday. The patient did not feel lightheaded today, felt it yesterday and did not notice it at all this morning, reported it has resolved.

                                                Developed fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath 1 day after 2nd dose of vaccine.   Started on antibiotics and steroids empirically prior to admission 02/15. Initial CT with diffuse centri-lobular tree and bud opacities.  Infectious (including BAL) and autoimmune work-up without clear explanation for infiltrate. Underwent VATS wedge resection for tissue diagonsis.  Post-op developed hypoxia requiring up to 10L O2 and worsening infiltrates on CT in a pattern consistent with organizing pneumonia (possibly drug reaction).   Started empirically on steroids for concern for organizing PNA/hypersensitivity pneumonitis.   Pathology returned with organizing pneumonia with increased eosinophils.  Timing of onset of symptoms is concerning for a hypersensitivity reaction to the COVID vaccine.   Symptoms are improving with steroids (started 02/26).  Recovery to be determined but I am optimistic for a good recovery.

I also experienced headache, nausea, diarrhea and fever. I continue to have  tingling in my face. I called employee health, and they told me to isolate. Because they were trying to rule out if it was COVID, but test was negative.

Took 1000 mg of Tylenol; and I was feeling okay. Just arm was sore. Not extremely sore. 8 pm at night - started shaking; knees were knocking together; severe chills; and it took a few minutes to recognize what was happening - took temp. 99.4; took another 1000mg tylenol; went to bathroom and without notice -  puked; woke up an hour after going to bed with worsened chills; 10:30 pm - temp 102.4; too early to take more Tylenol and so took pharmacy&#39;s version of Nyquil. Slept through the night after Nyquil but woke up with chills continuing - temp 103. 8 at 4:30 am; and then sat at side of bed and took tylenol 1000 mg  and got up to go to bathroom and couldn&#39;t walk forward and felt my arm hurt really really bad; couldn&#39;t walk forward; I leaned against the wall and bounced against the next wall and kept walking and grabbed a bedroom doorknob and got into the bathroom and fell on toilet and then crawled to couch because I couldn&#39;t walk straight. Stayed on a couch for two hours and then it was gone. Fever and chills continued that whole day on 24th. Didn&#39;t eat/had no appetite. Christmas day -no fever. Felt shaky though - like I&#39;d been super sick. No appetite still. Felt woozy and shaky inside (felt shaky inside) and that lasted for several days.  Appetite still remains poor. 02 stats were low through all of it - four liters (up two liters than normal.  Contacted: a pulmonologist - Dr. and she helped with O2 questions.

                                                After being given the vaccine the patient was asked to wait 15 minutes before returning to work. After 5-10 minutes  she reported shortness of breath and an anaphylactic type reaction. Patient was administered an Epi-pen by a nurse and the facility, and reported feeling &#34;a little better.&#34; She was also given oxygen and put on a pulse oximeter. Her O2 sat was 99% throughout. She reported before that she had no allergies and no adverse reaction to a vaccine in the past, but after this happened she said something similar also happened in the past with a flu shot. Patient believes this reaction was due to anxiety and not an allergy. 911 was called and arrived about 15-20 minutes after administration and patient was taken to the hospital. A nurse called the hospital 2 to 3 hours later and they reported she was &#34;doing fine&#34; and would be discharged home later today.

It was through the roof/Blood pressure was high and she was concerned she would have a stroke; Muscle soreness; Arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (physical therapist). A 57-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular on the left arm on 21Dec2020 08:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; and sumatriptan from 25Dec2020 to an unspecified date at unknown dose and frequency (standard unknown dose/ She only gets 9 pills a month) for migraine. Medical history included ongoing migraine, obesity (She would say she was kind of obese), coeliac disease (She had Celiac disease and cannot eat gluten which was diagnosed since she was 4), chronic back pain (this was diagnosed a couple of years before she took the COVID vaccine), spinal stenosis (this was diagnosed a couple of years before she took the COVID vaccine), and pain (she took hydrocodone for pain but did not take any that day).  Concomitant medication included hydrocodone for pain. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and events following prior vaccinations were none. The patient had the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and she got sick on Christmas day. She was vomiting at 14:00 and did not know if it was a side effect or not.  She did have arm soreness muscle soreness at 15:00, that evening and the next day too. She normally gets a migraine once a month. She does not normally throw up with a headache though. The vomiting started when she threw up twice on 25Dec2020, then once on morning of 26Dec2020.  She also had very high blood pressure. It was through the roof.  She did not know if that was related to drug for migraine or vaccine. She also had the headache at 14:00 the whole time. She believed she threw up before she took Sumatriptan. The muscles got rigid and tight in her neck and she doesn&#39;t think she took it. She threw up and then she took it. She did not have a lot or expiration. There was no ER nor physician&#39;s office required. She would have it if her car was not buried in snow. Her blood pressure was high and she was concerned she would have a stroke. It was usually around 110/70 and was always very low usually. She did not know if it was accurate, but it was 165/124 at one point and she did know her pulse was accurate. She did not provide her pulse rate. She did not know if she was throwing up because her blood pressure was high and did not know if blood  pressure was high because of Sumatriptan. She only gets 9 pills a month. She did not know if high blood pressure was one of the side effects. It was not a real safe medication to take once a day. She only took it once a month and only once that day. She had never thrown up with  migraines before and was just concerned. She doesn&#39;t usually take her blood pressure and doesn&#39;t know if the Sumatriptan always makes it go up or not. She doesn&#39;t know if she had the flu bug or not. The action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable, while for sumatriptan was unknown. Clinical outcome of sickness and influenza was unknown, for headache was recovered on 27Dec2020, while for the other events was recovering.

A 57-year old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE lot number EK9231) (at the age of 57-years-old), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 as a single dose for covid-19 immunization.  The facility where COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at a hospital and anatomically located on the left arm. The patient medical history included acid reflux She has been good for last 2 months. She was on Pepcid but not anymore; uterine polyp removal in 2019 (reported as 2 years ago) polyps removed from uterine wall, it was done outpatient but they still put her to sleep, but it had took her 2 weeks to get over the reaction of being put to sleep, it was the anesthesia, it wasn&#39;t pain, but she was very tired and groggy after. She does not know the name of the Anesthesia or have any Lot or Expiry; receives flu shot every year with no issue. The patient was not taking any concomitant medications. She has had No positive antibody or Covid test prior to the vaccine. She took the first shot last Wednesday 20Jan2021, she had a weird, not the usual reactions like she had read about. She even went to the Nurse Practitioner yesterday because of it. She was told she has nerve damage from the shot and a high immune response to the shot, which is a good thing, but her question is does she take the second shot. The nerve damage started at 10 o clock that night causing shoulder pain, back pain, being lower back pain, because of it she didn&#39;t sleep, only 3 hour Thursday night. She&#39;s a teacher and even had to miss school on Friday. It is just a constant dull aching pain. She was groggy. Some symptoms were typical. She never ran a fever, the pain in shoulder went to the arms, back across to the front of the chest, she can follow with the hand here, its achy all on the left side. She went to the Nurse Practitioner and she said it sounds like nerve damage. The NP did not do any test, she really just left the office hoping that it would resolve on its own.  Caller states that this is not going away.  She actually read to not even take Tylenol or Advil 2 days prior as it can lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine. That&#39;s why she didn&#39;t take Tylenol till Friday Afternoon on 22Jan2021. She toughed it out for 2 days. The doctor told her she can take Advil right now. The clinical outcome of the event: Low Back pain recovered; event Nerve damage was recovering; events achy all on the left side, Dull aching pain, shoulder pain, chest pain, Pain in arm, she didn&#39;t sleep, groggy unknown. She is scheduled for the second dose on 10Feb2021.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after vaccination (during post vaccination observation), patient reported feeling ?off? and that her throat hurt. I was contacted via radio to aid with assessment.  Upon my arrival, patient reported that that she was experiencing slight difficulty swallowing, was feeling ?off? and felt ?like her head was in a fog?. Assessment of vitals revealed an intial vital signs of respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, pulse of 74 beats per minute, 97% oxygen saturation levels. Blood pressure was obtained prior to arrival and was reported as 121/74. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Clear S1 and S2 were present upon cardiac auscultation with no mumurs or gallops noted. Patient appeared slightly pale with a slightly hoarse voice. Patient did not have noticeable pharyngeal edema upon examination. Patiney had no increased work of breathing and was not using accessory Muscles for breathing. Patient was given a swallow test using bottled water and then solid food and demonstrated intact ability to swallow with no regurgitation, choking or drooling noted. Continuous oxygen saturation monitoring revealed 02 that never fell below 96%. Continuous pulse monitoring revealed a pulse that was between 74-79. Given the stability the vital signs, demonstrated ability to swallow and inappropriately labeled IM medication in emergency kit (ie three loose syringes were not drawn up by myself. Medications were labeled by hand with no expiration date, route or dose), I elected to give the patient 25 mg of oral diphenhydramine. Patient declined to seek emergency medical attention several times. Patient?s daughter was then called so that the patient could be driven home. Patient was advised to seek emergency medical attention if her symptoms worsened, she developed increased difficultly breathing or otherwise felt unwell. Advised to follow up with PCP within next 24 hours.

Speech clear, no stridor noted. Pt stated does have a significant allergy history and sees an allergist. Medicated with Benadryl 50 mg po and immediately to ED, registered right away, pt then c/o head and back itching, and taken into triage for assessment by triage nurse.   Per Hospital Note: Patient initially developed hives and itching with progression in symptoms to include shortness of breath and throat tightening. She reported feeling as though her tongue were swelling and having difficulty speaking and having difficulty swallowing. Concerns of impending loss of airway prompted administration of IV Solu-Medrol, Benadryl and 2 doses of intramuscular epinephrine which were unsuccessful and therefore emergent intubation was performed.   Patient apparently has had prior anaphylactoid reactions in the past including bee stings and shellfish.

                                                Levels of TSH, among other indicators that pointed towards onset of hyperthyroidism. My doctor told me that this was acute thyroiditis. My heart rate was very high (122 bpm) when I visited my doctor&#39;s office and it was 130 bpm when I was triaged in the Emergency Room. Upon my doctor&#39;s advice, I went to the ER in the afternoon of 03/12/2021 where I was further tested. I was given medications to counteract inflammation, nausea and headache. In addition, I was given medication (beta blocker) to lower my heart rate. When my blood pressure was taken after a couple of hours, the readings revealed that my pressure had also started to fall. I spent overnight in the telemetry unit of the ER - I was given 2 liters of IV fluids to stabilize my vitals. The following day (03/13/2021), I met with endocrinologists who told me to what extent my thyroids were affected and what further medications to take. I had told them and other ER doctors as to what precipitated all of this. I was given anti inflammatory medication and a beta blocker that day before I was discharged in the evening.        I have no history of thyroid issues or heart issues. I do not suffer from any chronic illness. I was not sick before I took the second dose of the vaccine. I started to feel ill within 5 hours of taking the vaccine shot, and the symptoms worsened over nearly the following two weeks. Now, following medical intervention, I am continuing treatment with various medications. I don&#39;t feel well yet, and I understand that the process towards recovery is going to be slow and unpredictable.        I wanted to report this, since I feel that scientists and researchers should have this knowledge that thyroiditis can happen as an adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech).

Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible temporal relationship between immunization and onset of allergic reaction in a subject with a positive medical history for allergy to food (shellfish); causality cannot be completely excluded.

                                                Received vaccine on Monday by Wed afternoon lower abdominal cramping and feeling very unwell.  By Wed evening had chills and low grade fever 99.4.  Called out of work Thursday.  Felt terrible.  Thursday morning lower abdominal cramping consistent and pain scale between 4-5 with occasional spikes to 8.  Also felt terrible.  Had body aches, could only lay on couch.   Called my gastroenterologist.  Office returned call late afternoon and stated probably from vaccine and if it worsens or fever to call primary and to fill out VAERS form.  Thursday evening had temp of 100.4 and started with a cough where it felt I couldn&#39;t take deep breaths.  Only lasted a few hours.  Abdominal pain persisted.  Friday morning woke up and now have headache, but abdominal pain is now down to a 2 and I feel achy, but feeling a bit better.  Had to call out of work still too sick to go in.  No cough.  No fever.  Since I was feeling better my hope was since it was vaccine related that I would wake on Saturday and be totally fine, unfortunately, not the case.  Saturday morning abdominal pain same at a 2 and headache was on and off through the day into the night.  Still pretty much rested all day into the night.  Sunday morning much better.  Headache gone and abdominal pain down to a 1 and sometimes just vague.   Although I&#39;m feeling better my head feels out of sorts, kind of like my brain can&#39;t keep up with my eyes?  And new symptoms? right ear crackling and teeth on right side feel sensitive also,  pain under left armpit.  It&#39;s tender and lasts through the day.  Monday still feeling a bit lightheaded and fatigued and armpit pain still there but not worse and feel able to go to work to see if I can.  Tooth sensitivity also still there but ear pain gone.  Called primary doctor she suggests getting Covid test and have appointment for phone conference for Tuesday with doctor, also had  Covid test today at work  (was Covid tested last Monday also for work and negative) into Monday night head is still feeling &#34;off&#34;.  Tuesday armpit pain still same and dizzy head feeling same, mild abdominal pain comes and goes - Not bad enough to stop daily activity.  Spoke with primary doctor and she said side effects could possibly last this long and let her know when yesterday&#39;s Covid test comes in.........

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   I received the first Pfizer Vaccine (EH9899) on 12/19/20. A few days later, I felt like my head, on the side of my right ear, had a great deal of pressure in it and it felt &#34;funny &#34; but it did not really hurt. It was uncomfortable and distracting. I waited to see if it would go away. I noticed my hearing was decreased . On 01/06/20 when I woke up, my hearing was completely gone in my right ear. I could hear nothing out of that ear.  I had a noise in my head. Just a loud roaring noise. I had severe vertigo and could not walk across the room. I describe this as I felt like I was on a merry-go-round and someone was spinning me really fast. (continue)  Additional information for Item 18: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   continued:    I also experienced severe vomiting and could not stop. My husband took me to the doctor. Since I could not get in to my regular doctor that day, we went to an ear doctor I had visited a couple of years ago because that was the only person I could find to see me on short notice. I had regular hearing test in the past and my hearing was normal last time he checked it.  After doing a hearing test, he verified my Hearing was severely decreased in my right ear. I explained to him, I also feel &#34;foggy&#34; and I have problems concentrating, was having vertigo, and vomiting. I am not sure if that is because of the constant sound in my ear that distracts me but it is a definite problem and interferes with my work. I cannot concentrate. He started me on Steroids (Prednisone) 60 mg a day for 7 days, then 40 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for three days, Antivert 12.5 mg three times a day as needed, and Zofran for the vomiting if I needed that.  I have not experienced anymore vomiting and the Vertigo has been very limited. Mostly when I lay down now instead of when I stand up.  My blood pressure has also been slightly elevated, but it could be from the Steroids.   I was scheduled to take the 2nd Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21. Since I was receiving the high doses of Steroids, I was concerned that the vaccine would not be effective or may interact with the steroids so I went to my family doctor 01/08/21, for a visit. He said he would check and let me know if it was contraindicated for me to take the Vaccine on high doses of steroids. When I did not hear from him, because I had to take the vaccine the next day, I called the Pharmacy and talked to someone there and they told me the agency was still recommending you take the Vaccine even if you are on the steroids. I received the second Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21.  My hearing is now coming and going but I can hardly hear anything out of that right ear. . There is a constant noise, like a roaring, in my head and I still have problems concentrating. I have had no more vomiting and my vertigo has hot been as severe but I have experienced some at times.   I reported to the Pharmacy the day I received my vaccine, 01/09/21, about the things I had experienced this since my first vaccine. They took my information and said they would call me but today is 01/12/21 and I have not heard from them yet so I thought I would go ahead and report this. I am concerned this was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I return to the doctor 01/20/21 for a repeat hearing exam.   The Doctor expressed this condition could be a permanent and disabling  issue but currently being treated and will follow up with more testing.   I am also concerned about how the second vaccine affected me because I was receiving the high doses of Steroids at the time I received it.    I am sending this from a work email so if you reply, please reply to personal email.

A 58-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (Batch/lot number: EL0140), in Hospital, by intramuscular route in right upper arm on 23Dec2020 at 08:30, at 58-year-old of age, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She didn&#39;t receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that it has been 2 weeks since she received the COVID-19 Vaccine now and she still has a considerable amount of lymph node swelling and lymphedema in the right forearm side and the right upper arm. The nodes on the right side of her neck around the clavicle have been quite swollen for about 2 weeks. She has the list of side effects so she was not concerned, as this was listed but now she&#39;s not sure. When she got the vaccine she had the expected redness, swelling and tenderness at injection site (onset reported as 23Dec2020). On the evening of the 24Dec2020 she had an itchy scalp but she didn&#39;t see any rash and that only lasted a short time. On 29Dec2020 the patient had a significant swelling on the right side of the base of her neck near her clavicles that wrapped around to the posterior of her neck and was assessed as medically significant. She treated it by putting ice on it in the evening. On 30Dec2020 the swelling seemed to be slightly decreased but it is still a visible lump, the nodes are firm and there is swelling around those and it has not improved since the 30Dec2020. On 30Dec2020 she noticed a little cold blister or hive on the center of her lower lip and that was resolved by 03Jan2021, she did not have fever and did not feel sick, but her main problem is the swollen lymph nodes around base of neck around clavicle and it is considerably swollen there. The patient reported that last night (06Jan2021) it looked like her right arm was swollen, she thinks she is having lymphedema on the right arm, her right forearm is half an inch circumference larger than her left arm and was measured at her work. The patient reported she is seeing her new primary care doctor on 26Jan2021 and will follow up with the doctor. The patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose scheduled for the next week or should wait until the swelling resolves. Moreover the patient asked how long do the side effects usually last (specifically systemic side effects). The events &#34;redness, swelling and tenderness at injection site&#34; and &#34;slightly itchy scalp&#34; resolved on 25Dec2020, the event &#34;Cold blister on lip&#34; resolved on 03Jan2021. The event &#34;Swelling on the right side of the base of her neck near her clavicles&#34; had not resolved yet at the time of the report.  All the reported events were assessed as related to the COVID-19 Vaccine by the Primary Source Reporter (Method of assessment:Agency).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events swelling and lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.

The 58-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, intramuscular injection ), intramuscularly in left arm on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination in nursing home. Medical history included she had a right knee injury so she had some inflammation, She had stomach issues in the past- Barrett&#39;s syndrome, H. pylori(Helicobacter infection), GERD(Gastrooesophageal reflux disease), so, Pantoprazole is just a maintenance medicine, she was stable right now. She had a Vitamin D deficiency at one point.  Ongoing concomitant medication included meloxicam for inflammation, thyroid for thyroid(Thyroid disorder), pantoprazole for stomach issues, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 3) for supplementation therapy. There was no vaccination within 4 weeks. She received her first vaccine on 23Dec2020. There no other vaccine received in the same day. By 26Dec2020, she started with symptoms and then she tested positive for COVID-19 on 29Dec2020. She felt horrible with an excruciating headache and was wondering if she was going to die now. She can really feel for the residents she works with who get it. Right now, she was hopefully going back to work next week, but she was wondering about the second vaccine. People are saying she got COVID-19 because of receiving the first vaccine and she was hoping it was not the case. Is it going to be an issue getting the second vaccine after testing positive? The caller declines to include her healthcare professional for this report, stating she has been talking with her doctors over the week. Her symptoms included runny nose, congestion, and what seemed like shortness of breath when she started talking. She started having aches and pains over the weekend.

I had my 2nd vaccine at work early Sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day, I expected this so was not alarmed and went to bed around 10pm. I woke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise and went to the bathroom in case I might vomit, etc. and I tried to have a BM. I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in I was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive. He yelled at me for about 10 seconds and I came to, I was covered in sweat. I asked him to walk me back to the bedroom where I again passed out, fell to the floor and hit the bed, then was unresponsive again for about 10 seconds then came to again and vomited. After this I felt completely relieved of my malaise. I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F. After this I was sore but otherwise completely okay, the next day I had a temp of 99.5°F. Today I am back to normal. I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response. The vaccine was administered at Hospital Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event &#34;began to pass out&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

It is still present now, 10 days after receiving the vaccination.  I saw my MD today who assured me it is a typical appearance for a lymphadenopathy, but it still bothers me, especially never having had such an occurrence before.

                                                After being observed for approximately 20 minutes and patient walked to her car without assistance I was called to assess the patient in the parking lot for troubles breathing.  EMS was called as I made my way outside.  Upon my arrival patient was leaning out of the car and stating that she could not breath.  She was able to tell me that she was allergic to penicillin.  Oxygen was immediately placed on the patient with minimal relief.  Lung sounds were coarse throughout.  She then  began to vomit about every 20-30 seconds.  Epipen was administered in the right leg with no relief.  Patient continued to complain of troubles breathing and vomiting.  A second epipen was administered in the patients right arm again with no relief.  A few minutes later patient was given racemic epinephrine through the oxygen mask.  There appeared to be mild improvement in her breathing as she appeared more comfortable, but still complaining of shortness of breath and vomiting.  When EMS arrived patient was unable to transport herself to the stretcher.  When EMS and clinical staff transferred patient to the stretcher she became unresponsive.  She appeared to still be breathing.  She did not respond to verbal stimuli.  Per ED report large amount of fluid was suctioned from the patients lungs following intubation in the ambulance.  When patient arrived to the ED she was extubated and re-intubated without difficulty and further fluid was suctioned.  At that time patient was found to be in PEA, shock was delivered.  Shortly thereafter no cardiac activity was found and patient pronounced dead.

This HCP reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of two reports.  This 58-year-old female HCP (patient) reported for herself that received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK4176) on 10Jan2021 at 0.3 mL single by intramuscular injection left arm for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included ongoing hypertension and diabetes type 2, both diagnosed about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EH9899) on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that a few days after receiving the 2nd dose (on 14Jan2021), she went into atrial fibrillation and had been having palpitations ever since. She had a cardiology appointment in a few weeks and they started her on apixaban (ELIQUIS). Lab data on 14Jan2021 included EKG: normal sinus and Kardiamobile (a medical grade ECG): it showed tachycardia and at least one other time showed atrial fibrillation, heart rate 141. The outcome of palpitations was not recovered, outcome of other events was unknown. Reporter seriousness for atrial fibrillation and palpitations was medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of  atrial fibrillation cannot be fully excluded.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.  ,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021111803 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

                                                The first symptoms was pain in the injection site. Then felt pain traveling down to my left arm and fingers. I was told I was only to stay 15 minutes after the shot. On my way home from the vaccination about 30 minutes after the shot, I felt sick. I had a rapid heart rate and itch red hives on my left chest and left palm of my hand. My husband stopped along the road and gave me benadryl. I still had hives the next day. On the third day I had vaginal spotting and I am in menopause and  I had extremely bad pain in my left hip, left thigh and left buttocks for 2 weeks. I could not sit or stand up to get relief. I cried with pain and thought I would never recover. I visited a urgent care and he suggested I see a neurologist for the pain. I was tested for covid at that time and was negative. I went to an allergist to see if I am allergic to the PEG in the vaccine. I am not allergic to the compound. She believes my body had a very strong immune response to the vaccine which caused all the symptoms described above. All symptoms were strictly limited to just the left side of my body. I do not know what to do about taking the second dose because I am afraid it will be worse.

She got up to walk outside and started feeling dizzy.  Her hands felt tingly.  She also felt a little short of breath.  She came back in and sat down and the symptoms did not seem to really improve.  She states they have been about the same over the last 20 minutes or so. She was then escorted to the ED of the facility for evaluation &amp; treatment if needed. Per the ED doctor&#39;s notes: &#34; The patient did feel much better after just being observed here and after getting Benadryl.&#34; She was released home. Employee health followed up with her at 4:30 PM the same day &amp; at 9:45 am 1/6/21--she reported that she was doing well at both follow ups, a little tired but had not had any repeat of previous symptoms.

I went back to work  I also had some weakness and being tired but that went away and weakness in my legs but that went away didn?t last long.  The numbness and tingling in my face and neck did not go away.  My arm is still sore.  I did go to the er last night cause my blood pressure was high at home and face still numb and tingling.  Just thought I better check things out.  Dr wasn?t sure if it was a reaction from the covid shot he was checking for stroke issues all tests he ran were good.

                                                soreness around the injection site; Had severe arm pain; Had a fever on the night of the 31Dec2020 of 101.3; I have painful lymph nodes/the swollen lymph nodes under her right arm, the armpit area had swollen and painful lymph nodes; I have painful lymph nodes/the swollen lymph nodes under her right arm, the armpit area had swollen and painful lymph nodes; had joint pains/knees and hip joint pain; severe fatigue; muscle pain; This is spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 59-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:15 at first single dose (0.3 cc, but really uncertain of dose) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID virus from Nov2020 to 2020 (The patient was not hospitalized. It was a mild case and lasted about 10 days. she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines at the same time or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccinations in past or events.  Caller reported she had the first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on the 30Dec2020 and having some side effect symptoms and her supervisor recommended for her to report these things, they are not life threatening, obviously, but things were still lingering. Side effect of severe fatigue started on the 31Dec2020 and lasted for 72 hours. It was so severe, now it is mild. The patient reported soreness around the injection site. Had a fever on the night of the 31Dec2020 of 101.3 and had that for 6 hours then it dissipated and was gone. Had never had a fever after injections before. Had severe arm pain that usually goes along with an injection. It started also that night of 31Dec2020. She had rolled over in the middle of the night and it hurt. That lasted for about 48 hours, but it has improved. Had some muscle aches since 31Dec2020 but that had improved and had joint pains since 31Dec2020. What was worrisome was the swollen lymph nodes under her right arm, the armpit area had swollen and painful lymph nodes, since 31Dec2020. The patient was still having that and that is why she was so concerned because shouldn&#39;t that have gone away after a week. Had knee and hip joint pain, but that had improved. Again, mentioned she had never had that before with an injection. The patient received vaccine at her workplace. Some of her coworkers got it the same day and no one else has this. Mentioned she did have COVID virus back in Nov2020 and wonders if this correlates with her getting the vaccine. Was not hospitalized or notified she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue. This is the same way she felt back when she had the virus back in November. The patient was concerned about having these side effects would it be okay for her to get the next injection in 3 weeks. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. No further details provided. Outcome of the events Fever was recovered, of event swollen and painful lymph nodes was not recovered, of events knees and hip joint pain, fatigue, muscle pain, severe arm pain was recovering, of event soreness around the injection site was unknown.  The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as serious (medically significant). The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, severe arm pain, muscle ache, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Short of breath; Fluish symptoms; Fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 59-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL1283, expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm, from 08Jan2021 at 11:30, at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization and progesterone at 700 mg, daily (takes 300mg  in the morning and 400mg and night) and then 200 mg (yesterday took 200 mg and today she took 200 mg), at unspecified route of administration, from an unspecified dates, for perinatal menopause symptoms. Medical history included allergic reaction to Penicillin, ongoing borderline high blood pressure, sleep apnea, perinatal menopause symptoms, and allergic reaction also with Sulfa drugs, it is hives and wheals with Sulfa drugs and overweight. The patient previously took prochlorperazine maleate (COMPAZINE) and experienced anaphylactic reaction, Diavan and experienced angioedema and allergic reaction, and first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number is EJ1685 with expiration Mar2021) on the right arm, on 18Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient was calling about Pfizer COVID vaccine number 2. She knows she could go on the website but she also had a question she would like to see if she could be answered. She said she took the COVID vaccine 2 on 08Jan2021, Friday, and on 10Jan2021, Sunday she noticed she couldn&#39;t breath after taking her Progesterone. She takes Progesterone for perinatal menopause symptoms and she really needs it. She noticed about 20-25 minutes after taking her progesterone that she was short of breath and this has continued if not increased. It is not going away since then and she is wondering if there is any end in site. She went to a physician that is very knowledgeable and he said it is triggering an inflammatory response but she is really short of breath she is walking around with a O2 sat monitor on. She doesn&#39;t know if there is any end in site. She does not want to have to go in the hospital. Mainly after she takes her progesterone she is short of breath and she has gone down on her  dosage a lot and she still having shortness of breath. She took the progesterone and 25 minutes later she became short of breath. The reaction has increased since it started on Sunday evening, 10Jan2021. She is noticing, she is still taking it and it has a long half life but even with dropping the dose a lot even with that it has stayed the same or gotten worse. She says she took her Progesterone on Saturday as she normally would. But Sunday morning when she took her 300 mg in the morning about 20 minutes or 25 minutes after she was very short of breath like she can&#39;t get a whole breath of air. She has reduced the dose she is taking now. Yesterday she took 200 mg and today she took 200 mg. She has been on it for 3 years and she has never had shortness of breath. She has never had shortness of breath before even though she is overweight she has not had shortness of breath unless she is running or some sort of exertion this is totally new. She said her initial side effects the fluish symptoms and fatigue began Friday evening on 08Jan2021 and had resolved completely on Saturday, 09Jan2021. Outcome of short of breath was reported as worsened (not recovered). The action taken for progesterone was dose reduced.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event short of breath is more likely due to progesterone based on more close temporal relationship.  However, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot #: not sure EL3249 or EU3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose at left deltoid for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, hypothyroidism, heartburn. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, olmesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, omeprazole for heartburn, alprazolam. Patient had the tiredness, mouth sores or something like that in Jan2021. When patient look at her cheek, the gum inside cheek have white spots on it and it looked red and swollen and it hurt, especially the left side and that bothered patient because patient cannot really eat and it hurt. It was more of the cheek inside the mouth, that&#39;s painful. It&#39;s not open sore but it&#39;s just red and like tender. And also patient had a tenderness of lymph nodes on the left neck. For causality, the patient thought so because nothing has changed since before patient got the vaccine. Patient didn&#39;t have any of this, especially the sore in the mouth. Patient cannot eat on the left side because it hurt. But the rest of the symptoms which was the tiredness and the swelling of the lymph node, lymph node was kind of tender but it&#39;s only on the left side, that&#39;s listed as the side effects. But the sores in the mouth was not listed that&#39;s why patient was worried about that. Lab work: results were okay. The tiredness, it was like patient got it in the morning, so patient slept. Patient went straight after work, then patient slept. When patient started getting ready for work and the alarm went off, patient was extra tired so I called out sick, but patient was okay. For treatment, patient took naproxen sodium (ALEVE) and then, because patient was at work and yesterday it was really bothering patient because it was hurting. It started hurting really more when the evening was on. Then patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL), then the nystatin solution, patient tried to swish and it helped a little bit with the pain. Due date for the next dose was 08Feb2021. Outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

They wanted to keep me in the hospital but I told him I will follow up with my doctor on Monday, I did not want to stay on the floor with covid patients the test that they had ordered at the hospital were normal they did not order a CMP they only did a basic metabolic panel and that was normal, so I followed up with my doctor on Monday which was January 18th, and she ordered CMP and all the labs, when they threw my blood my liver enzymes were very elevated over the thousands LT ASG and the and others, then the doctor ordered a second set of blood works of CMP just to make sure it wasn&#39;t a fluke, they were even more elevated they were over 1,400.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) via unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 10Jan2021 09:00 (lot number EJ1686 and expiry date unknown) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a hospital and not in a military facility. Medical history included asthma. Concomitant medications included albuterol [salbutamol] from unspecified date for unspecified indication. Historical vaccine included flu shot in Oct2020 for immunization and experienced some soreness in arm and achy. The patient was not given other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. In Jan2021, the patient had some soreness in arm and achiness (Jan2021) after the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine it didn&#39;t last long and she went to work afterwards. The patient was scheduled for work the next day and could tell something was not right. The patient was flushed and thought it was from the Albuterol since it can cause a racing heart beat and checked for a fever and didn&#39;t&#39; have one. The patient checked temperature before bed and it was 100.5 degrees and she went straight to (redacted). The patient informed that she went for Covid testing; she went to physician office for Covid testing. The patient was praying for the flu so she could take Tamiflu and the flu test was negative (21Jan2021) and the Covid testing was positive (21Jan2021). The patient was tested positive after first Covid vaccine and ran fever 8 to 9 days and highest temperature was 101 degrees, had a little bit of asthma and kept a close watch, congestion, pulse ox 92 (lowest level), tightness in chest (no productive cough), felt beat up, fatigued and tiredness. The patient was diagnosed with Covid-19. She was told as well not to take pain relievers (ibuprofen, Advil and Aleve) and was advised to take Tylenol instead. The patient informed that she was to get her second dose tomorrow. The patient wanted to know if she can get the second dose if she was tested positive. The patient was supposedly scheduled to have the second dose on 27Jan2021 however it was moved to 04Feb2021 due to tested positive of Covid and was put on quarantined. The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient was unable to provide seriousness criteria when queried and said that this was her luck of the draw.

                                                I tested positive for Covid on November 11th 2020,and was asymptomatic.   Within 48 hrs of getting the vaccine both my right hand and right leg started tingling and I had pins and needles sensation. I also woke up in the middle of the night with immense night sweating.  My arm started becoming numb and cold.  I talked to a doctor and she suggested I go to the ER right away as this could be indicative of a minor stroke.  I was admitted in the hospital as they needed to run several tests.  I spoke with other doctors who suggested not taking the 2nd shot as it could make matters worse.  So I opted out of taking the 2nd jab.   I wonder if there is any study about adverse reaction for former Covid positive people and if they are better of only taking the 1st jab.  Another Covid positive friend also had a similar reaction after the 1st jab. His right side of face became numb. I am worried about lasting damage if any.  Could somebody please get back with me on this.

A 59-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 59) as a single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included an unspecified heart condition and a flu shot un an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) and ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS [ASCORBIC ACID;ERGOCALCIFEROL;NICOTINAMIDE;RETINOL;RIBOFLAVIN;THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE). The patient stated, &#34;I am calling about the side effects I had from my Covid shot vaccine. I am concerned about getting the second one because my reaction was so big. I got it on Saturday, this past Saturday about 12:45 I think 12:30 and I did fine, the shot didn&#39;t hurt at all. That night I was a little bit tired but that&#39;s it. My arm was just little bit sore. The next day I got up, I still felt good I went to work for 2 hours and then about 12 o&#39;clock it hit me all at once. This Sunday I ran anywhere from a 103 to 104.6 fever and that was me taking Tylenol and I took Tylenol every 4 hour because my fever was still high. The glands in my neck and the glands under my arm on the side where I got the shot swelled up, they are still swollen. My whole body ached. I had Covid fairly bad I got pneumonia with it all for &#34;two weeks&#34; (not clarified) but my fever was not as high as got with the shot, the vaccine like I could barely walk after the vaccine because my joints were so stiff only way I could walk was to shuffle my feet, it was horrible. I had a fever yesterday all day but it was only in the 102.3 and 4, it never went back to 103. Glands in my arm and my neck hurt quite badly. My arm where I got it, it wasn&#39;t swollen but I get the same reaction when I get a Flu shot (unspecified shot) so that&#39;s not a big deal. I got horrible headaches. I had diarrhea all day Sunday and yesterday and so this morning my fever is only right around 101 like 101.1, 101.2, I am still super tired and also yesterday and day before I was dizzy and foggy. I still have a slight fever today. My lymph nodes are still swollen, my neck and under my arm, my arm where I got the shot is still swollen and sore but I can tolerate that. My joints are stiff a little bit but not nearly as bad as they were, so I don&#39;t know if I should get the second shot, everyone says the second shot is worst like all those heart palpitations start with it as well.&#34; One of my other symptom is at night I break out into a horrible sweat like I have to change my pajamas twice. It was last night and the night before. I am like really wet.&#34;  The outcome of the events was not reported.

                                                Within a few hours of shot, I experienced EXTREME tinnitus (very loud), numbness in head, face and lips and hardening of lymph gland in left chest. This lasted for hours. Injection site pain only lasted about 24 hours.  Since then, I still have numbness on the right side top of head and intermittent EXTREME  tinnitus that interferes with my ability to concentrate, communicate and sleep. It comes and goes but the volume is beyond anything I have ever experienced. Then it goes away. The  right side of my head has stayed numb.   Will this go away? Should I get the 2nd dose or not?
