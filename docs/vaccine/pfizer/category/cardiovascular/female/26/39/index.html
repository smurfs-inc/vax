                                                On 12/24 at around 10 PM, circulation to my 4th left digit significantly decreased after being outside of my car for around 15 minutes during a temperature of about 50 degrees. I realized when sharp pain was felt at the digit. After about 5 minutes the digit felt numb. I got in my car, turned on the heater, and massaged my finger. Sharp pain was felt again as circulation returned to the digit. The event last approximately 10 minutes from the moment I realized the finger was pale until color returned.   This occurred again on 12/27 at around 2 PM as I walked from my car into a store at a temperature of about 40 degrees. This time, discoloration occurred bilaterally on my left 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits and my right 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits.  The event lasted more than 15 minutes with constant massaging.   This has occurred two more times since then, both times occurring bilaterally with minimal exposure to cold.

                                                Approximately 15 min after vaccination began to experience tingling sensation under tongue. It was not bothersome so I proceeded to go home. At 2:04 pm, approximately 40 minutes after vaccination was driving home and began to experience an elevated HR, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and throat tightness. Proceeded to pull over to a gas station and felt extremely weak when trying to walk and a tingling sensation all over.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl tablets and symptoms began to subside within about 10 minutes or so. Proceeded to continue driving home and had another episode at 2:49 pm, experienced significant shortness of breath and tingling sensation in mouth spread to back of tongue and it felt swollen. I bought liquid Benadryl instead and took ~20 mL. This episode resolved within 10-20 minutes as well and was okay for the rest of the evening.

Did not say anything and sat there for the 15 minutes with continued shortness of breath and high rate think it was anxiety. When the time was up I continued to stay at the hospital for an hour due to fear of bad reaction. Started to become extremely nauseous within 30 minutes and loss of appetite. Went to bed and woke up with a terrible headache, body aches, extreme fatigue and a 100.3 degree fever. Slept for 8 hours during the day waking up due to the pain in my body and chills but the symptoms went away by 5 pm the following day of the shot.

After 15 minutes the dizziness did not go away and my vitals were checked. My BP was elevated 136/106 and HR 105, I was taken to the ED after repeated BP readings continued to show increased diastolic pressure. I was observed in ED for a period of almost 6 hours. Within an 1.5 hours after receiving vaccine, I had right neck stiffness, headache, and some weakness to the right side as well along with the dizziness and high BP. I received a 1L bolus of NS, 2 doses of antivert, Toradol, Zofran and Lidocaine patches. 24 hours after receiving vaccines, I was having pain at the insertion site, headache, neck stiffness and occasional dizziness. After 36 hours my symptoms subsided and I felt back to baseline.   Vaccine Dose 2 01/07/2020: I received my second dose of the COVID vaccine and within the first 15 minutes I experienced dizziness, nausea, flashing spots in vision, right sided weakness, increased BP &amp; HR, redness and sweating. After 30 minutes the symptoms did not subsided and I was taken to the ED. An hour after receiving the vaccine, I had right sided weakness to arm and legs with no numbness, dizziness, R. sided neck stiffness, right sided headache, nausea and flashing spots. I received Ativan, Reglan, Tylenol, Toradol and Benadryl in the ED. I was in ED for 3.5 hours after vaccines was administered and was able to ambulate to the car independently.   16 hours after receiving vaccine, I had muscle weakness to bilateral lower extremities and was unable to ambulate independently along with dizziness, headache, arm soreness, cough, congestion, neck stiffness and fatigue. 36 hours after vaccine I regained movement to bilateral lower extremities however still was experiencing fatigue, occasional dizziness, intermittent neck stiffness and headache, body aches and some shakiness to lower extremities. 55 hours after receiving vaccine I was still fatigued and experiencing intermittent headache and neck stiffness. 72 hours after vaccine I was still fatigued and having occasional headaches but feeling much much better from initial reaction. 96 hours after receiving vaccine I experienced occasional headache, woke up with neck stiffness and was finally able to drive a car without any dizziness or nausea. 144 hours after vaccine I am not completely back to baseline still fatigued with occasional neck stiffness and headache but able to go back to work.

I was having flushing, tingling through my whole body. My blood pressure went up to 139/96. I was having itching and blotchiness on my chest, neck, left arm and thighs.This lasted for 3 hours with my heart rate going up and down. I was sent to the ER by the nurses who gave my vaccine. There they gave me Benadryl. 2 tablets of 25mg each. This helped and I was sent home.

                                                At 1 AM on 1/19/21, I awoke with chills, a fever of 101, neck pain, muscle pain, joint pain, and a severe headache. This persisted throughout the night and I did not sleep. Took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen at 5:30 and slept until 7 AM. By 8 AM, my temperature was back down to 98 F. Took 500 mg of Acetaminophen at 10 AM with food. Headache, muscle pain, and joint pain persisted. Moderate to severe chest pain began 15 mins after eating at 4 PM. Waited 30 mins to see if it resolved; it did not. Went to the urgent care. Chest x-ray and EKG was performed, no issues found. Was diagnosed with costochondritis and was given a steroid shot and ibuprofen,  which reduced the pain significantly within 30 mins later.

This reaction occurred within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine. Pt was pale, sweaty, diaphoretic, hypotensive and had bradycardia. Pt&#39;s systolic BP was in the 60s and her diastolic was in the 30s.  Pt was offered food but refused. Pt was immediately brought to the ER where her care was transferred to an ER nurse.

Headache and body aches have worsened in severity. Unable to work for the morning but was able to go in the afternoon for a short time period. Lower body aches are particularly severe. Fatigue is noticeable. Mental health conditions have worsened but that may be due to lack of sleep.  30 hours following the vaccine: chills, nausea, and dizziness have dissipated completely. They were slowly improving throughout the day. Body aches and headache still severe but lessened with marijuana use.  48 hours following the vaccine: all symptom seemed to have subsided during the night. Sleep was much better quality. Only remaining symptom is an ache on the right side of my chest towards my ribs.

                                                Within five minutes I felt very faint and dizzy along with nausea. Then came the shortness of breath and the feeling of pins and needles which also brought itching and some minor hives with it. The dizziness, nausea, and feeling of fainting went away after about 10 minutes and I had to go to the Emergency Department to take care of the shortness of breath and hive like reaction. I was given some medications and they diagnosed it as a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine. I was completely fine with the first one.

This was treated by reclining with feet up, sitting in a dark room, and drinking cold water while monitoring symptoms. Symptoms resolved within minutes.  About an hour after injection lethargy, feeling chilled, in particular hands were very cold, mental fog, and slurred speech. This resolved without intervention within a couple of hours.

For about 36 hours, it ran 100-130&#39;s; Dehydration; Feeling fatigued/Excessive fatigue; Had some general arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies. The patient started feeling fatigued about 1900 hours (07:00 PM) on 08Jan2021 and only had some general arm soreness. She woke up on 09Jan2021, with serious chills to the point of physical shaking; nausea started soon after and around 0300, began vomiting and dry heaving. The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

                                                After receiving the second dose of the covid 19 vaccine, as I was walking to the elevator, my vision started to become blurred and I began to see stars. I walked over to a nearby chair and as I sat down it felt as if my throat was closing. I began sweating profusely and my whole body was flushed. My heart rate was tachycardic and my blood pressure was hypertensive when checked in the ED. When I got to the ED, my vitals were obtained like I described but my heart rate had slowed down by time I got there. A nurse passing by explained that my heart was tachycardia when he assessed me in the chair. The ED did an EKG of my heart that determined my heart rate was normal sinus rhythm in the 70s. They observed me for roughly an hour and let me go home. My discharge papers explain I had a vagal response.

A 26-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number EL3302 via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 12Jan2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Previously the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Dec2020 at 17:00, lot number EJ1685, in left arm, for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at Hospital Facility.  No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. No COVID prior vaccination. COVID was not tested post vaccination. No known allergies. Medical history included asthma and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 12Jan2021 the patient experienced syncope, fever, joint pain, weakness, dizziness, tachycardia, fatigue. The events required Physician Office visit. The patient was not treated for the events. The outcome of the events was resolving.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported syncope cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 26-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number= ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: cephalosporins, coconut. Other medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Jan2021 at time of 05:00 AM, the patient experienced blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine and continuing into day 4 DOST vaccine, swollen lymph nodes under bilateral arms that had not decreased, chills and sweating, headache. No treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures post vaccination which included COVID nasal swab test and COVID PCR test, both were negative on 14Jan2021. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.

As far as what happened, I received my 2nd dose of Pfizer on Jan. 13th @ 05:15 at hospital and started feeling symptoms roughly six hours later, symptoms being nausea, chills, splitting headaches, muscle fatigue, feeling tired and joint pain. I had understood that these side effects were common and not to worry, however, the next day on Jan. 14th around 11:00am, I blacked out at home. Luckily, my partner had caught me before I feel to the ground, but he stated that my eyes had glazed over, my breathing was shallow, and I hardly had a pulse. He was getting ready to do chest compressions, but I had come out of whatever fog that had knocked me down and became responsive. Around 12:00 pm I had arrived at the ED where they had given me a bag on NS, Zofran for the nausea and Toradol for some inflammation management. I believe I discharged from the ED around 15:20.

She still has a lump at the injection side which has gotten smaller in size but still hurts to touch. Left arm has a knot in it from injection site; does not reuired ER or visit to physician&#39;s office. It feels like a bump with something in her arm. She doubts that is the case.

They came and gave to everyone all at once. It was really big at first. It felt like someone punched her. It was a big giant lump, but it is getting better. The injection was given in the upper left arm and it felt like it went into the muscle. The outcome of the event vaccination site mass was recovering, and the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

I had only been driving for a few minutes, maybe less than five when I felt like my arm I got the shot in started to go numb and soon followed a feeling of lightheadness. I thought about pulling off to the side but didn&#39;t make it in time because the next thing I knew I woke up pressed against the median on the other side of the freeway I was driving on. I completely blacked out while driving. I had to call an ambulance because I was freaked out and wanted to be looked at and my car needed to be towed.

A 26-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Other medical history and known allergies were reported as none. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the report and vaccination. Concomitant medications included zinc, ascorbic acid (VIT C), ergocalciferol (VIT D) and an unspecified birth control medication. The first dose of BNT162B2 (brand: Pfizer as reported) was received on 06Jan2021 12:00 PM in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient had no other vaccine in the four weeks prior to second dose vaccination. On 27Jan2021 23:00, the patient experienced nose bleed, fever of 102, severe injection site swelling (grapefruit size), lethargy, tachycardia, shortness of breath, severe joint pain, migraine and muscle pain. The patient did not receive treatments for the reported adverse events. Patient had COVID test post vaccination specified as nasal swab on 27Jan2021 with test result as negative. The events were reported as recovered with lasting effects.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the close drug-event temporal association and the location,  the reasonable possibility that the reported severe injection site swelling is related to BNT162B2 seems likely.

The patient stated, &#34;You kind of feel yucky after the flu vaccine, but she has never had this with a flu shot.&#34; The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t had a flu shot in years. The patient asked if arm swelling was a normal occurrence after vaccination and if side effects can last for 4 days. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan and afterwards experienced, arm swelling, and tenderness that has last for 4 days. She also reported experiencing feeling faint, high blood pressure of 150/100 and some trouble breathing on an unspecified date and nausea. The patient further reported that she was calling because she got her first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine and she was curious if this was normal and if she needs to go see her doctor and she wants to report the symptoms. After she got the injection she felt super faint and got really high blood pressure on an unspecified date. She was not sure if it was because she had anxiety, but she had trouble breathing on an unspecified date. She got nauseated afterwards. Her arm swelled up really big and the swelling has stayed there for four days. Her arm was still swollen on an unspecified date. She has allergies and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. She was still nauseated and feels super tired. The patient asked how long do the symptoms last. The patient&#39;s weight was reported between 122 to 123 pounds. The patient clarified that the nausea started 15 minutes after she got the shot on 28Jan2021. The nausea has lasted through this. She got chills the next day (29Jan2021) after the shot. She has felt super fatigue. The swelling has gone down, but it was still swollen. It was still hurting. She has no idea if that was normal. She also felt dizzy and disoriented after getting the shot. She was not sure if it was because her blood pressure was so high. It was high for her because her blood pressure was normally low. She thinks her blood pressure 150/100 after she got the vaccine. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

I had high blood pressure 180/120, facial puffiness and mild bottom lip swelling. I developed an onset of increased mucus in my throat causing me to clear my throat frequently. RN on site reported no throat swelling, but increased thickness due to mucus. I received a Benadryl injection on site within 30 minutes and almost immediately symptoms began to lessen. The next day I had mild bottom lip swelling, body itchiness, chest rash, headache and fatigue. Today (24 hours after vaccine) I have a headache, fatigue and body itchiness.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I began having chills and vomited. My fatigue became more severe as well. Later that evening my fatigue persisted and I noticed a rapid heart rate via my Watch. My resting heart rate which usually is about 80 BPM was at 100 while laying down and not engaged in any physical activity. When I stood I was dizzy and had poor balance. While my entire arm no longer hurt, the injection site showed a bump as well. When I awoke the next day my heart rate appeared normal again, and I wasn&#39;t especially fatigued compared to before I got the vaccine. I did experience another minor gastro-intestinal episode later that afternoon, but otherwise my symptoms appeared to have passed aside from the fatigue. By the end of my work day I was very tired again, although it is uncertain if this is due to the vaccine or from my continued recovery from Covid and adjusting to the physical demands of going back to my job in-person. Because I received my vaccine on the same day as my first day back to work, I have no experience working post-covid before having the vaccine to compare my current state of fatigue to. On the evening of 01/07 I noted that fatigue was slightly less pronounced. I do not currently have a primary care doctor but will be calling to try to gain an appointment so that my second dose can be monitored.

I was unconscious for about 1-2 minutes. My blood pressure  several minutes later was low (about 90/50 but I took it myself so may not be exactly accurate)

                                                At 2am that next morning January 8th (almost 12 hours post vaccine) I woke up out of my sleep delirious, light headed, heart was racing, diarrhea, and felt like I was falling in and out of almost passing out, hot flashes, couldn&#39;t think straight. It wasa very scary experience for me. This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

I felt really dizzy and nauseated, I felt like I could not walk. I felt like I hit by a bus. The next day I had heavy flu symptoms, high fever, continuous chest pain and high HR, at the ER they gave me a high dose of Benadryl, steroids and fluids. I took Benadryl for about 7 days and I still felt light headed palpitations and fever for almost 2 weeks. I also was tested for COVID and it was negative. I was advised to not take the second vaccine. I still have a really bad fatigue. It is the symptom that is still on and off.

                                                When I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID shot I had no issues. When I received the second dose I had the vaccine injected and then I got up and walked to the monitoring room where we sit for 15 minutes. Immediately upon sitting down in that room I felt very woozy, lightheaded, and my heart was beating out of my chest. I checked my pulse on my smart watch and it was in the 80s but my resting HR is normally in the 60s or 70s. I got nervous at that point so I took some deep breaths and tried to relax and my symptoms improved within a minute. I sat for the remainder of the monitoring period and right at my 15 minute mark all of my symptoms returned. HR in the 100s, lightheaded like I was going to pass out, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath. I alerted the nurse in the monitoring room and she took my BP and HR and they have me a bottle of water. My throat felt a little weird too and I was worried that it was starting to close up, but I was able to swallow  water normally. I remained in the monitoring room for about 15 more minutes and at that point my symptoms mostly resolved and I felt well enough to leave. For the next approx 48 hours I have had some mild- moderate chest heaviness. More worse in the initial 24-36 hours after the vaccination.

A 27-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Jan2021 at 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; received at a nursing home/senior living facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Medical history included COVID-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included unspecified birth control taken for an unspecified indication from an unknown date to an unknown date; within two weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: syncope episode in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, unconscious in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, fever and chills on 09Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, blood pressure was low, about 90/50  on 09Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, did not feel well in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown; all of which were assessed as medically significant. The clinical course was reported as follows: the fever and chills began about one hour after vaccination (as reported). About 18 hours after the vaccination, the patient was getting up to take more paracetamol (TYLENOL) and did not feel well. The patient had a syncope episode in the bathroom (no issues as she sat on the floor before hand). The patient was unconscious for about 1-2 minutes. The patient&#39;s blood pressure several minutes later was low, about 90/50; however, the patient took the blood pressure measurement herself, so it may not have been exactly accurate. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: low, about 90/50 on 09Jan2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of all reported serious events cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Symptoms were managed with over the counter antihistamines until 1/11 when the antihistamines were not working and my throat was swollen and tight, my chest was tight and my voice was horse. I got prescribed prednisone on 1/11 and have been on a long taper of that, with scheduled benadryl, pepcid and zyrtec.

Thursday I just felt red, itchy, swollen L arm due to vaccination site. Friday morning my bottom lip was severely swollen with numbness and tingling. It went down by the next day and after taking Benadryl. I have not had an allergic reaction to anything in my life before. Was instructed to not get second vaccine as I may have a more increased reaction to it.

I was laid down and vital signs were taken. My heart rate was in the 110s and 120s and stayed elevated for about four hours. The hives resolved and did not spread to the bilateral arm or anywhere else. The following two days I felt incredibly weak and had urinary frequency. I was told to go to the hospital by the health clinic staff but I declined.

I tried to bear down at home to decrease my heart rate but it continued to climb to 164 so after an hour of sustained Hr 126-164 I went to the emergency room where I had SVT. They did a valsalva maneuver 3 times and that made my heart rate go down to the 130s. It was then sinus tachycardia and stayed 120s-130s until about noon. Upon discharge at 3:30pm my resting heart rate was still 105 but it was determined to be a vaccine reaction as all other tests were normal.

While in the medical observation area I tried to take a sip of water but could not swallow it. At that moment I began having a tight feeling in my chest. I began to hyperventilate followed by difficulty breathing or talking. This was accompanied by feelings of impending doom, and uncontrollable trembling and inability to concentrate on what the medical observation area Doctor was saying. The time from the drink of water until I was able to breathe, speak, and concentrate normally was about 20 minutes. Tightness in my chest has improved but not fully recovered. General malaise and headache have developed.

In her first trimester she had significant hyperemesis treated with medication and IV fluids but this resolved after the first trimester.

Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

On 10Mar2021, patient had eye puffiness in her left eye. Patient asked if it is safe to take the second dose. Her eyelid got puffy which began 30 minutes after having the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and it is not ongoing but resolved completely after a few minutes. She did not require treatment for the eye puffiness and the puffiness was mostly on her upper eyelid of her left eye. Patient stated that she does not know in terms of causality if the Pfizer COVID vaccine is related to the reported events and was worried because a week after she got the vaccine, she had other symptoms and was not sure if they are connected with the vaccine. She also reported that she does not think the eye puffiness itself is that serious but it is medically significant and the other symptoms she had were chest pain, chest heaviness, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are not ongoing anymore and began around Friday, 19Mar2021 and resolved after a couple of hours of when they began. For the chest pain, chest heaviness and abdominal pain, she just took an antacid Prilosec for treatment. She thought about going to the emergency room but also thought she was having an anxiety attack and was close to having to go to the emergency room that night. She did get pretty anxious easily and that probably exacerbated it. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office.

At 5:30 pm I started getting a fever, that started at 100.5 then increased to 103.3 by 8:30 pm. I was also nauseous and vomited once.  I was tested the next morning for influenza and COVID and was negative. My fever came back down to 98.8 around 12 pm the next day. Overall, symptoms lasted approximately 30 hours after the vaccine was administered.  I was out of work the following day after the vaccine. Now, 2 days after the vaccine I am just mildly fatigued with a dry cough left.

Mostly burning sharp pain, but some restricting tight pain as well, radiating to my back mostly. It would be relieved for maybe 10 minutes at a time but then flare back up for about 5 hours.

Previous to the chest pain, during the morning and afternoon of 01/12, I had a low grade fever (99.9 F), an intense headache, and fatigue. 01/14/21 sore swollen lymph node under L arm.

                                                I got the COVID Pfizer vaccine and experienced warmth in my chest with the first vaccine. It went away after one day and was tolerable. I also developed a lump under my right armpit with the first dose that slowly went away. It was painful, but the pain was tolerable. With the second vaccine, I also got the chest warmth and chest pressure for 2 days. I did not seek help as it was also tolerable. I also developed the lump under my armpit with the 2nd dose, this time I still have it and it is more painful and bigger. I have been taking naproxen for the pain.

                                                I was awoken from sleep with violent chills and an sensation of severe cold. My chills became violent and coarse rigors, severe enough to contract the spine into hyperextension if I kept my body in a neutral position. I could still activate each muscle group to keep in a fetal prostration pose. I was knowledgeable of the event, did not loose any bowel, bladder, or smooth muscle function, and the intensity of the rigors was focused on the most developed skeletal muscles (thighs, calves, upper arms, forearms, paraspinal muscles, hands, respectively).  Jaw and muscles of the head/face seemed unaffected. Fingers and toes not distinctly affected. I was not sweating at this time and there were NO other symptoms to report; I remained lucid and able to self-reflect the entire time. Home temperature is kept to consistent 66F, no malfunctions to thermostat. No recent changes to bedding (sheet and quit on top of mattress); it is even optimized for me as I tend to overheat as I sleep.   At 50 minutes, I felt &#34;less frozen&#34; and confident enough to stand/ambulate for 220mg naproxen &#43; 500mg APAP , cautiously and successfully swallowed. Robe was donned over existing pajamas and thick comforter was pulled from hallway closet. Rigors continued, but it appeared that intentional activation of the muscle groups could still overpower the rigors for safe (but shaky) ambulation. Greatest risk was coarsely shaking hands a bringing cup to mouth to swallow pills.   Above activity was completed in 5 minutes. I then sat upright in bed under layers above. I could feel the muscles calm and relax, with episode completely ending in 5 minutes. Total time of event: 60 minutes.   Post-event details: There was a mild sensation of muscle tension in the posterior cervical spine akin to whiplash, but no residual symptoms. I debriefed with my husband shortly thereafter (he has been in another room the whole time) and fell asleep by 23:30. Awoke to alarm at 05:00 and able to stretch, accomplish 30 min run, vacuum/mop the floors, and present to work by 08:00am without deficit.  Time of documentation: 11:22 am 1/15/2021

                                                Reporter received the second COVID-19 vaccine on 1/20/2021 at 08:25 AM.  She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose.  Around 08:40 AM,  she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat).  Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable.  She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination.  This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.   Of note, patient had experienced a similar reaction following her first vaccination (E-number 261589)

Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

A 28-years-old female patient received dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28Jan2021 10:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), asthma (mild), PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), anxiety, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), allergy to egg whites, allergy to bee stings and diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included desvenlafaxine succinate (PRISTIQ), methylphenidate, hydroxychloroquine sulfate (PLAQUENIL), clonidine received within 2 weeks. The patient previously took escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) and experienced Allergy to lexapro, sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) and experienced Allergy to Zoloft, quetiapine fumarate (SEROQUEL) and experienced Allergy to seroquel, erythromycin and experienced Allergy to erythromycin. On 28Jan2021, the patient experienced fatigue throughout the day increased. The patient developed headache. Awoke around 28Jan2021 23:00 with aches, chills, severe headache, weakness, dizziness, and nausea. She did not feel she could move safely to retrieve OTC medications for these symptoms which were far worse than any illness she can recall having. She likely would have went to the ER for help but she couldn&#39;t have driven herself and her kids were home. She did not want to call 911. On 28Jan2021 23:00, she did experience an episode of nearly passing out sometime during the night when she attempted to sit up on the edge of the bed to take some Tylenol. She could not regulate her temperature as she fluctuated between being diaphoretic and cold to being overheated. In the morning she finally felt well enough to go to her medicine cabinet downstairs and decided to essentially sedate herself for the day with Benadryl, Xanax, zofran, Tylenol, and ibuprofen. She then slept from about 10am until about 5pm. She felt considerably better upon waking up, with just fatigue, nausea, and headache. The report was reported as non-serious. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not pregnant. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events fatigue, nausea and headache was not resolved and the outcome of the other events was resolving.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested

                                                3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt a sense of panic and a tingling on my lips, that then spread to my mouth, throat, and tongue. I asked the nurse if my lips were swollen, and she said no.  A few minutes later my heart rate increased and I felt really lightheaded. After 7-10 minutes I felt my tongue tingling and it had become swollen. I told the nurse that I think my tongue was swollen and she said it looked okay. I had a hard time talking because I wasn&#39;t used to be tongue being so large. The nurses stayed and talked to me for the rest of the 30 minute waiting period. I was able to talk and breath while making a conscious effort.  I wasn&#39;t sure whether the high heart rate and lightheadedness were associated with my condition, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. I kept checking my tongue to see how swollen it was.  After the 30 minutes, the nurses had me stand up to see if I could. Once I could, they said I was all set to go. They did not get an Epi-pen for the swollen tongue or give me instructions on how to treat it. They were insensitive and dismissive of my symptoms. they kept repeating &#34;I think your just nervous.&#34; Once I got home, I still had the swollen tongue and tingling, but was able to go up and down stairs and go about my day. It was a little difficult to swallow one of my pills when I got home, but I was able to. I checked my blood pressure around 4:30 p.m. and it was 121/84 and my pulse was 79 bpm sitting. I did not take anything to treat my swollen tongue. The swollen tongue and tingling feeling in my throat continued for another 2.5 hours, until 6:00 p.m. Once the swelling was down, my tongue felt like I burnt it on a hot beverage, almost a numb feeling. I also experienced more common side effects such as body aches, fatigue, and feeling feverish.   After this episode I had extremely high anxiety where it was difficult for me to sleep the following night. I called a 24/7 nurse line and she said to talk to my doctor. I had less than 4 hours sleep the night after I had my vaccine.  I called my doctor&#39;s office this morning and I spoke to a nurse who worked as a nurse on the COVID Vaccine hotline.  She relayed the message to the doctor who was covering for my doctor while she&#39;s on medical leave. I received a call around 9:30 a.m. saying that the doctor on leave recommend I should talk to my PCP but that she thought I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and that I should not get the second dose. She said they were not sure how I would react with the second dose, and they&#39;re afraid that my allergic response might be more severe and life threatening.  I hope this report helps other people who experience these symptoms.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

The patient previously took fluconazole (DIFLUCAN) and experienced allergies. A few minutes after taking the vaccine, the patient experienced a tingling feeling in lips, which then spread to mouth, throat and tongue. The patient told a nurse and she said that she looked fine. The patient asked if lips were swollen but they weren&#39;t. Then a few minutes later she felt very lightheaded and had an elevated heart rate. Then around this time, she saw her tongue was swollen to about double the size. The nurse said she looked fine, and monitored her for 30 minutes then let her go. This swollen tongue lasted for about 2.5 - 3 hours. After the swelling subsided, tongue felt like it was numb/burnt by drinking a hot liquid. 12 hours later, she woke up in the middle of the night with an elevated heart rate and had trouble sleeping. The patient spoke to her doctor and it sounds like she had an allergic reaction, even though she have no history of allergies for any of the vaccine ingredients.

A 28-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 28-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 07Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism, being nervous, passed out, and anxiety. Concomitant medications included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), quetiapine fumarate (SEROQUEL), gabapentin, bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and lorazepam (ATIVAN) for being nervous. The patient received the Pfizer vaccine last Wednesday (07Apr2021) and immediately after that, at about 1:30 (unspecified), she just started having a seizure. They thought that it was more of a major response she was just having, fighting and was nervous about it, but it was kind of a different situation. The reporter has seen the patient passed out before. She did some blood test on 07Apr2021 and her sugars were fine. The reporter&#39;s concern was that they didn&#39;t know whether she should get the second one. The reporter didn&#39;t believe she got a seizure but was not sure about it. It&#39;s just that what immediately happened after she got the shot was that she passed out and they called the ambulance. After she passed out, she went to the emergency room and they did blood work on her. The reporter just did not know if they were going to let her go for the second dose because they couldn&#39;t relay if it was a seizure or a bizarre response where she just syncope and fainted. They were just thinking it was a bizarre response as it was just blood pressure drop but they were just not sure where to go from here. The patient was told to rest and intravenous fluid and something through the blood were given. The patient also experienced sore arm from 07Apr2021 for 2 days and had a low-grade fever the following day (08Apr2021). The outcome of the event sore arm was recovered on 09Apr2021 and recovered on Apr2021 for all other events.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 28-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: Ek9231), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 28 years, on 12Jan2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, angiolipoma, labral surgery to hip, drug hypersensitivity to penicillins; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ethinylestradiol, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE 1/20) and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]); both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, bactrium ds and experienced drug hypersensitivity, doxycycline and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient received first dose of COVID vaccine BNT162B2 (lot number= Ej1685) at the age of 28 years on 22Dec2020 on the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that 2 weeks after the second vaccine, she underwent hip labral surgery and suffered a PE on 22Feb2021. She was not sure if the vaccine could have contributed to the PE or just the surgery but wanted to report just incase. She was taking aspirin to prevent DVT&#39;s. The patient was hospitalized for pe (pulmonary embolism) for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures (DOAC) were taken as a result of pe (pulmonary embolism). The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event pulmonary embolism is likely an intercurrent medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2. Patient&#39;s hip surgery two weeks after the vaccine might have contributed to the event onset.

                                                I noticed my heart rate was very high and bounding, and I felt very shaky. I took my heart rate at home with a pulse oximeter and it was 150bpm. I went to the emergency room where they did an EKG, labs, and chest xray; all were within normal limits. I was observed for a few hours and sent home.

No itching or hives. 1/9/21 at 3am my heart rate started to increase to about 110bpm while sleeping and continued till 4am. 1/9/21 at 4am my apple watch alerted me to my heart rate was above 120bpm while resting. This is when I realized I was sweating and felt like I had a fever.  I drank water and went back to sleep. 1/9/21 5am heart rate was at 135. then 6am 148bpm. 7am around 161bpm. Kept trying to go back to sleep. 1/9/21 8am got up and took an adult benadryl tablet and drank plenty of water. Tried to relax to lower my heart rate.  1/9/21 9am took another adult benadryl tablet and was able to get my heart rate just below 120 while sitting. Then ate breakfast and went back to bed. If heart rate was not going to lower, I was planning on going to the ER. 1/9/21 10am till next day. Heart rate was then under 100bpm. I was then so tired that I slept all day and did not eat anything else.  1/10 I experienced severe body aches, chills and headache. This was all day. 1/11 I woke up feeling mildly nauseous for about 3 hours and then dizzy for about an hour. after that I just had a sore arm. 1/12 Had a mildly sore arm.

I could not sleep that night after I received my vaccine. I decided not to go the ER and slept it off I woke up much better next morning. I saw a Doctor a couple of days later because I had shortness of breathing and a high heart rate while I was at work. He just told me to take it slowly at work. No meds.  I then started working part-time for some weeks and am being introduced again now to my regular scheduled.

A 29-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot#: El3248), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 15:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. At 0230 on 07Jan2021 patient woke up shivering with a high fever. Didn&#39;t realize it was a fever until 5am when  woke up more, temperature taken at that time was 100.6. Fever stayed all day until 2000, no less than 99.0 even with Tylenol and ibuprofen until that time. Also developed body/muscle aches around 1200 on 07Jan2021, and some nausea. Got sent home from work that day. On 08Jan21 patient synced my (brand withheld) and checked my heart rate for day before. Didn&#39;t know it till then, but had heart rate of greater than 100BPM all day on 07Jan2021. Highest it got was 130, my resting heart rate is usually in the 60s. Also on 08Jan2021 no more fever, but whole right arm is in pain and have a swollen lymph node around right clavicle area. Pain with minor touch to clavicle and upper arm (at site of injection). Will be going to visit a doctor to make sure it is just a swollen lymph node since it is now 09Jan08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still swollen and there&#39;s still a lot of pain to R arm.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm on unspecified date at a single dose (2nd dose) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Physician stated, &#34;she had no medical conditions, she was in very good you know very like standing with herself.&#34; Patient had her 1st dose of Covid vaccine on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Physician (reporter) stated, &#34;I am the parent of someone who got the COVID dose, the second dose yesterday. I am very concerned because my daughter yesterday (08Jan2021) started to have symptoms and fainted at 4:00 in the morning and hit her nose and has a scar now. She had her second dose yesterday (pending clarification), after the second dose last night she started to feel unwell, getting chills, nausea and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted, she blacked out. She lives alone, she is an adult, she hit her nose, got the scar in the nose, and the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop, she was bleeding from that scar. She told me it took two hours for bleeding to stop from that scar.&#34; When asked when the events started, Physician stated, &#34;Last night (08Jan2021), at 4:00 am she took the shot during the day while she was at work. She said, she started to getting chills and then she was nauseated.&#34; When asked if patient was still experiencing the event, the parent reported no as patient was just resting. Also stated, &#34;She didn&#39;t take any treatment but she said she took Tylenol.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;I am concerned, we are going to be taking her to the urgent care now but I am concerned about what is going on with platelets and all of that because of what had happened, last night the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop for two hours and she was alone at the night and weekends. She said, she had to lay down and then her dad is there now because he is closer, he is going to be taking care of the urgent care but I want Pfizer to know what my daughter has gone through last night after she took this second dose.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;she is having a rash in her arm, she had little red in her bumps as well. I want her to go get checked up as soon as possible in urgent care.&#34; Patient was taking some Ibuprofen (later clarified that patient took Tylenol as treatment). She was not taking any other medication. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information Requested on Lot/ Batch number.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported faint was most likely due to an accident, and less likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE).

Two separate instances of this pain, one on 1/18/21 at 1600-1730, and one on 1/18/21 2230-0000.  The second instance the pain was so severe, lead to nausea and one episode of emesis. Initially trialed treatment with antacids but that did nothing to improve the pain. Evaluation by MD on 1/19 at 1300 diagnosed with pleuritic pain secondary to inflammation. No prior history of this, no cardiac history, and no history of GERD.  Other post vaccination symptoms included fever approx 10 hours following the vaccine, nausea, one episode of diarrhea, fatigue, body achs, dizziness, and chills, all of which resolved by 1/18 at 1100am.

I then was speaking with management and felt faint and short of breath, continued to be tingly.  Last night 1/19/21 I had a moment of not feeling well and my heart rate went from 60s to 120s with shortness of breath and nausea qnd tingling. This continued for about 30 minutes, I was debating going to the ED for the SOB. I then became really cold and had such bad shaking I couldn&#39;t hold anything for another 20 minutes.  Today I continue to have some tingling. All of this on top of the expected side effects.

On Jan. 21st, 2021, I woke up feeling feverish.  I went to use the bathroom, and after washing my hands I walked towards the bathroom door and felt light-headed and dizzy.  Suddenly, I passed out and hit my head and upper neck on the tile floor.  My parents heard the sound of my fall and luckily rushed to the bathroom.  They found me lying  unconscious on the floor with my eyes rolled up for what felt like more than a minute.  I regained consciousness on my own, and I drank water with a bit of sugar and salt mixed in.    I felt too weak to get up and walk, and the back of my head and upper neck were in pain.  I told my parents to call 911 as I wanted to make sure that there was no serious damage to my brain or neck area.  I went to the local hospital in an ambulance.  I was taken to the emergency room: Vitals were done and my temperature ranged from then was 99.5-101F and my heart rate was high- it stayed around 112 bpm for some time I was given 2 L of IV Saline Fluids EKG result: no clinical abnormalities CT head/neck/spine: negative 2 different types of COVID-19 tests: results were both negative Bloodwork: CBC/BMP/D-dimer: no clinical abnormalities Chest Xray: negative 2D- doppler ultrasound: negative Holter monitor: negative for irregular heart rhythm I was discharged the same day around 4:30pm

                                                I received heart palpitations for Seven days after receiving my second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. They began within an hour after I received my second dose but did not occur during the period; I was asked to stay at the Hospital for monitoring. I did not receive Heart palpitations after my first dose. These palpitations were extremely brief; lasting about 1-2 seconds and occurred spontaneously throughout the day. They occurred multiple times throughout the day (up to 20 times). I had an EKG done showing no concerning results. These palpitations stopped after a week and I have not had any since 1/15/21. I did not get lightheaded or nauseas from these palpitations. They were strong enough to notice but did not have a negative impact on my day-to-day activities.

                                                After the vaccine was administered, 5-10 minutes later I began to feel a rapid heart rate. One of the nurses came to check on me, I described to her my symptoms, and she let me know if they get worse to inform her. In the next 5 minutes, my head began to hurt, as well as, some chest pain. She checked on me again, and said to let her know if things got worse. Within the next 5-10 minutes after, I had difficulty swallowing and speaking. I raised my hand, and the nurse came over, then proceeded to get help. They then took my blood pressure and heart rate. My blood pressure was 185/103 and I believe my pulse was 156 bpm. I was still having a hard time swallowing and speaking. They proceeded to get an epi pen and the doctor on site, as well as suggested to send me over the ER/ call 911. The doctor checked my lungs, and they noticed my blood pressure and heart rate was not decreasing to a normal level. I was then put in a wheel chair and transferred to the ER. At the ER, my blood pressure and heart rate was still elevated, as well as difficulty swallowing. The doctor ordered Benadryl via IV, steroids, and the epi pen. After having a reaction to the Benadryl, the epi pen was put on hold. After about 15 minutes, I began to feel better. I was put on IV fluids and observation. I was able to leave the ER around 12 pm 2/05/21. At this time,  7:22 pm, I am feeling better with mild muscle aches, and fatigue.

She was then walked out to the waiting room to wait her 15-20 minutes that is strongly recommended after receiving the vaccine.  Approximately 5 minutes later, she alerted the reception staff that she was having some sort of reaction.  I was then notified immediately and patient was brought back to a private exam area.  Patient complained of chest tightness, numbness in fingers and a racing heartbeat.  She also felt that she was having difficulty breathing.  Vital signs at that time were 96.3 temperature, RR 36, blood pressure 170/100 and a heart rate of 174.  Patient received (1) epipen  and 911 was simultaneously notified.   2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula were applied.  Shortly after epipen was given and oxygen applied, patients heartrate decreased into the 130s.  Oxygen remained stable at 99-100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Ice pack applied to base of neck for comfort.  EMS arrived and report given as patient will be taken to the emergency department for further evaluation.

                                                minutes after administration, patient reports head feeling strange, so I asked her to remain seated so I can observe her prior to getting up to the observation room. Then she reports feeling nauseous and weak. I asked her what medical conditions she has and she told me she is diabetic and has kidney disease. I asked if she ate breakfast, she said she did not, only had something small before heading out in the morning. I gave her am ice pack to place on the back of her neck which helped relieve her symptoms of head feeling strange and the nausea. Once nurse arrived, we checked her pulse and blood pressure, at this time it was around 11:45 am and her pulse was low at 64 and blood pressure at 94/60, which patient states is her baseline normal blood pressure. We opened the windows so she could get some fresh air since the room was very hot and shortly after we took her pulse and blood pressure she seemed to be feeling better. By 11:50 am the ambulance arrived and paramedics asked if she would like to be taken to the hospital to get checked, she said even though she is feeling a lot better, she would prefer to go just in case.

The first dose of bnt162b2 was taken on 17Dec2020. The patient&#39;s medical history included bipolar disorder. Concomitant medications included quetiapine (QUETIAPINE). The patient experienced some kind of back pain, behind her heart, heart pain and pretty strong chest pain on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered. In addition experienced &#34;fatigue caused by the vaccine was so profound that was advised to not take her bipolar medication, quetiapine&#34; on an unspecified date with outcome of recovered. It was reported that &#34;It took 36 hours for the extreme fatigue to stop.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as no. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes omeprazole, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (MARLISSA), venlafaxine and gabapentin from unspecified dates, received within 2 weeks of vaccination, for unspecified indication. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 (Lot number: EN6204) on 13Mar2021 at 11:00 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient previously took hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN) on an unspecified date and indication and had allergy. On 02Apr2021, around 10pm, patient began having chills and extreme muscle pain and spasms, and the lymph nodes in her left armpit swelled up so much that she couldn&#39;t put her arm down without extreme pain.  By midnight (03Apr2021 00:00), patient had a fever and was unable to stand unassisted. She was writhing in pain and arching uncontrollably off the bed.  She believed in hindsight that this was a seizure as she went in and out of consciousness and her tongue swelled up, making it hard to breathe and impossible to speak. She was sweating profusely, and had to drink water constantly.  Her husband had to help her get to the bathroom because she couldn&#39;t support her own body without tipping over.  The chills and fever alternated all night, and she finally passed out from exhaustion at 03Apr2021 at 7am. The next 2 days, she was in a cycle of fever and chills again, and the fever got so bad that she seized twice more on Saturday (03Apr2021).  She had to take the day off work on Monday (05Apr2021) as she was still in so much pain that she could barely leave bed except to use the bathroom. Events were reported as life-threatening, immediate risk of death from the events. Patient was not hospitalized. Treatment for the adverse events were cool baths, naproxen (ALEVE) for fever and pain, and PEDIALYTE. COVID-19 was not tested post vaccination. Vaccination facility type was at a hospital. The outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

This healthcare professional reported information for both mother and fetus/baby. This is a mother (patient) report.  A 29-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), first dose (batch: EL9262) on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 29-years-old) then second dose (lot: EN6201) on 18Feb2021 (at the age of 29-years-old); both via an unspecified route of administration as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included blood clot (during her previous pregnancy); pulmonary embolism (during her previous pregnancy) and pregnancies (previous pregnancies were kind of close together). Concomitant medication included enoxaparin sodium (LOVENOX) for blood clot prophylaxis/pulmonary embolism prophylaxis (patient had a blood clot, a pulmonary embolism, during her previous pregnancy and so they make her prophylactically take it, always has been on it. The patient had a blood clot and was breastfeeding so she did enoxaparin sodium and she got pregnant again and was still on enoxaparin sodium). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 on 22Jan2021, and the second dose on 18Feb2021. She was pregnant at the time, subsequently developed pre-eclampsia on 22Mar2021, and delivered on 25Mar2021, 7 weeks before her due date. The patient&#39;s seriousness for preeclampsia was hospitalization from 22Mar2021 to 28Mar2021 and life threatening. The patient stated that they delivered the baby and the overall preeclampsia has resolved. The patient&#39;s blood pressure remains somewhat elevated and heart rate was severe, intermittently in Mar2021 with seriousness of medically significant and hospitalization from 22Mar2021 to 28Mar2021. The patient had a doctor appointment at a maternal fetal medicine on 22Mar2021 then from there she was delivered because her blood pressure and heart rates continued to worsen. The patient still has increased blood pressure, but she never had any blood pressure issues, just mild. The patient&#39;s blood pressure remained somewhat elevated and heart rate remained very elevated, but she couldn&#39;t say there was still protein in the urine (in 2021). The patient stated that her heart rate and blood pressure improved, and were medically significant. The patient remained on the dose and then her heart rate went up, not her blood pressure, just her heart rate went up really high starting in February, beginning of March and they increased her dose to, maybe in March, beginning of March, her heart rate went up, had her on enoxaparin sodium at 100mg once daily as her prophylactic dose and changed and went up from that to 100mg twice daily by injection. The patient stated that she may have weighed a little more (in 2021). The last weight was with pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. The patient weighed 205 (unspecified date). The patient was pregnant so she was seeing more of her maternal/fetal medicine and OB, but had seen her primary care throughout, maybe once. The patient stated that they didn&#39;t have enough data on pregnancy and neonatal and she wanted to contribute and advance knowledge in her area by providing information. The patient got the vaccination just on her own, just wanted to protect herself and her baby, the benefits outweighed the risks so she proceeded to get the vaccine. The outcome of the events blood pressure increased and heart rate abnormal was recovered in 2021; for pre-eclampsia was recovered with sequel on 25Mar2021 while for the remaining events was unknown. The patient did not believe the pre eclampsia had anything to do with the vaccine. The patient was not indicating that the vaccination led to the pre-eclampsia, that&#39;s for Pfizer to determine.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the events Pre-eclampsia, Blood pressure increased, and Heart rate increased are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination may provide a plausible explanation for the events. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021374536 Same reporter/drug/event for different patients (for baby)

                                                Sudden onset cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing. A fever of 100.6 was noted but unsure as to when that occurred as I did not have chills. Feber has subsided.  Cough, shortness of breath and intermittent wheezing remain as well as some chest pressure, sore throat, headache and chills. Coughing fits are bad enough to cause urinary incontinence but I did give birth 4 months ago so this may not be significant. No signs of allergic reactive such as redness, urticaria or swelling.

Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus. No further details provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events syncope and dizziness are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

After receiving the vaccine we had her stay in the room directly in front of us for 30 minutes so we could monitor her. It was noted she seemed to be having difficulty breathing &amp; at that point we administered the first epinephrine 0.3mg dose. She reported feeling better &amp; her color got better. We continued to closely monitor her &amp; in approximately 7 to 8 minutes her breathing became labored again. A second epinephrine 0.3mg dose was administered &amp; we called to have her transported to the hospital.

My hands and feet became clammy. A small fan helped subside symptoms momentarily. Within minutes my lower extremities became shaky. I developed chills and felt faint. VS were measured. I was hypertensive (BP 134/100, baseline BP usually runs 110/80s). I developed intermittent tachycardic and heart palpitations, with a max HR of 124. Symptoms lasted approximately 1hour post vaccine administration.  I work at a COVID testing site, chances of me being exposed to COVID-19 are high. I was not tested prior to receiving either dose of the vaccine; however, I have remained asymptomatic for the duration of the series.

A currently 31-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 30-years, on an unspecified date at a single dose as COVID-19 vaccine. Medical history/concurrent conditions included positive ANA; ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); known allergies to sulfa drugs and mangoes. Concomitant medications included methylprednisolone (MEDROL), ibuprofen, and baclofen (received other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination). She was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was vaccinated in a hospital (facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered). She did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced sleep paralysis 2 days after vaccine associated with tachycardia on unspecified dates. The events were non-serious which did not result in death, not life threatening, did not caused/prolonged hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, did not cause congenital anomaly/birth defect. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and did not have Covid tested post vaccination (had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination). Treatment was not received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

I felt itchy all over.  When I stood up, I felt palpitations and started to feel as if I was going to pass out.  I sat down and I started to tremor and felt like it was hard to catch my breath.  I took an antihistamine and took a puff of albuterol.  I felt a lot better. At 10 AM in the morning, the hives have improved but i still feel some pruritus.

Patient walked out of the vaccination room after her 15 minutes observation period and did not complain of any symptoms. She walked to the main entrance and notified a clinic manager at the check-in desk that she was experiencing &#34;chest pain.&#34; Clinic RNs came to observe and assess the patient. The patient communicated with no displays of distress. When asked what type of chest pain, she stated &#34;heaviness pressing on her chest, localized on the left side and on the upper chest area.&#34; Patient denied pain radiating down arm and denied jaw pain. Patient denied SOB and had no signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. She was escorted to the ED via wheelchair at 18:33. The ED note states that symptoms were most likely related to anxiety (patient mentioned she was anxious about receiving her second dose) and as patient reported symptoms completely resolved, she was discharged home from the ED at 19:01.

Around 2:30am felt pressure and warmth (coming in waves) up towards my chest, lasting 1-2 seconds and occurring about every 5 minutes . Was able to withstand feeling until it became difficult to breath. Lips and face turned white and blue, fainted. Felt extremely nausea when awake.  Called 911. Vitals were normal apart from BP was very high 130/100&#39;s. EKG was NSR. Blood sugar taken was normal around 113. After 1 hour of event, I took a shower and drank water. I felt the wave one more time before trying to fall asleep. Then stopped. Woke up fine.

Each episode lasts 30-40 mins then subsides and symptoms go away completely. I had 3 episodes of these symptoms the first day and so far 3 the second day. My doctor recommended I go to the emergency room.  Based off my EKG, vitals, and family history there was no reason to believe that the episodes were causing any heart abnormalities.

I tried to wait it out for a  couple of hours and nothing improved so I went to the ER 12/31/20 and they did EKG and other tests. They medicated me with Ibuprofen and sent me home. The next day I had to go again because the pains were worse. At the ER at 01/01/2021 they redid the same tests and all came back normal. I still feel the chest pains not as strong they come and go. I had them yesterday but not today. My PCP does not know what to do and prescribed me XANAX to keep me from getting stressed and making it to come back. My employer suggested doing a COVID test but I had not had a chance to go and have it done yet.

My heart rate went up to 186 I became Tachycardia. I t came in all of a sudden.  I ended up going to the E. They gave me IV fluids, Benadryl thru the IV. They also did a CT scan on my brain.   After three hours they discharged me . I felt  Tachycardia for about two days after. After the 2-3 day I felt better.  I had another Tachycardia episode  on January 25,2021- I was scheduled to get my second dose but didn&#39;t get it done.  It just hit me and my heart rate went up, it has not gone away and have been dealing with it for about two weeks. I have a heart monitor on me.  I saw a Gastrologist and they want to do an EGD to rule out ulcers.  I&#39;m not able to eat without feeling a hot rush and my heart rate going up.  I have lost 12lbs since the 20th.

She was initially very ill and was thought to have sepsis due to fever/initial presentation/clinical picture, also had lab abnormalities including thrombocytopenia.  These things necessitated transfer.  While at hospital, hematology was consulted.  Decision was made to transfer due to concern for DIC/possibility of leukemia. Also there was concern for C Diff, treatment was given for this.  While in hospital, she underwent further testing on blood samples which revealed no evidence for malignancy, also bone marrow biopsy was performed.  While there, DIC labs were trended/began to improve.  Discharged on 1/5/21.  Had f/u with hematology @ hospital on 1/12/21.  No reason has been found as of yet as to why she became ill.  Per discharge note it&#39;s thought it could have been viral in nature, or possibly related to supplement use.  Will f/u with heme in early Feb.   Of note, she does report getting her first dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 12/17/20, she reports concern that this could have played a part in her illness.  She states this was the only new/out of the ordinary thing that she can remember recently, regarding her medical hx, prior to recent acute illness/hospitalization. Requests I reach out to inquire how she can file a report with Pfizer or CDC

She did not take any medication to alleviate the adverse effects during the timeline. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient recovered from back pain in 13Feb2021, the patient recovered from the remaining events in Feb2021.

The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

This  30-years-old female patient received at hospital bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1  administered in Arm Left on 17Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9809) as SINGLE DOSE, and dose 2 on 07Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) administered in Arm Left  as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.

The patient got 1st dose on 17Feb2021 and developed Vaginal bleeding, bloody noses.  She said she was having a period every 2 weeks, and &#34;spotting&#34; every other day. The she got 2nd dose on 07Mar2021, and experienced nose is bleeding and vaginal bleeding again.Then it was added she completed both; and keeps having irregular bleeding. she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination 17Feb2021 at an unknown time in the left arm. On that day she noticed irregular bleeding, spotting. Mentioned she has had her tubes tied in the past and so she called her gynecologist who made an appointment for her. Then she got her regular period two weeks later to she cancelled that appointment. She continued to have spotting even after the period was over. She mentioned this to her gynecologist twice and he said to wait and see. She received the second dose 07Mar2021 at 16:50 PM in the left arm. She noticed today on 10Mar2021 she was having vaginal bleeding and spotting with bright red blood and also a nose bleed. Mentioned she also noticed blood with sex.

Seriousness criteria provided -Other medically important conditions. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it is unlikely  that the reported &#34;vaginal bleeding, spotting with bright red blood and nose bleed&#34; were due to bnt162b2.  These are probably intercurrent medical conditions.  Case will be reassessed of additional information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

It would come about a min. or two apart. Lasted for 30-45 min. Resolved on it&#39;s own. They transported me to ER. They listened to lungs; did not hear wheezing. My blood pressure was elevated a little initially - 130/90 which is elevated for me. And then it went back down within that 45 time frame. I was monitored there in ER. They wanted to monitor me in the ER so logistical reasons. Did not have rash or light headness. Released after an hour of observation and symptoms had resolved. Then went back to work. The place of vaccination and ER were the same hospital.

My HR went up to the 160s, my BP was elevated to like 166/80.  I was given 25mg benedryl, which calmed the flushed feeling and I was monitored for about 30 minutes and finally my BP and went back down to around 130/70 and my body normalized out besides the tingling which lasted the remainder of the day.  I had a little nausea.  I went back to work and finished out the day.  I took more benedryl when I got home to help with the tingling feeling which finally deminished after about 24 hrs.

                                                Developed a &#34;scratchy throat approximately 20 minutes post vaccination. Symptoms worsened and she developed shortness of breath. Required evaluation and treatment in the Emergency Department. Received Benadryl, dexamethaxone, famotidine and solumedrol. Second COVID vaccine, no reaction with the first vaccine. ED provider notes below: This patient presented due to concern for allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine and was seen by myself immediately upon arrival.  When in triage the triage nurse noted her oxygen saturation was 81% so she was placed on 2 L nasal cannula and brought directly back to her room.  When placed in the room she was hooked up to the monitor and her oxygen saturation was 100% and I took her off of the nasal cannula and her oxygen saturation remained in the upper 90s.  She had no stridor and respirations were nonlabored.  She was speaking without difficulty and had no vocal changes.  She did not appear to be in any acute distress.  Her posterior oropharynx was widely patent and she had no uvula or tongue swelling or lip swelling.  She did have some blotchiness to the upper chest area but no hives.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  Pulse was regular.  Blood pressure was stable.  She was nontoxic in appearance.  An IV was established and the patient was given Decadron and Benadryl for initial treatment.

                                                Right after the second dose less than 2 minutes my heart rate began to spike. I could feel my heart pumping fast. I couldn?t sit due to this so I began pacing the room. I didn?t know this was a side affect so I thought I was over thinking the second dose. I attributed this to all the worry and doubt the media and people around me try pumping in your head. I thought I was having a panic attack. I didn?t alert any of the medical team there because again, I thought I was over thinking it. A few hours later my heart rate had gone down. My Apple Watch helped me monitor this. The next day I felt pain at the injection site, not my normal self, groggy. Slightly feverish and chilled. I work in a cold environment so I couldn?t quite tell if the chilled feeling was a side effect, or the room. Later that evening around 9pm things took a turn. I began running a low grade fever and was shaking from being so cold. About another hour late my fever was up to 101 and I was still shaking from being so cold. I took about 600mg of ibuprofen. I couldn?t sleep, tossed and turned. Probably another hour later my temperature was 102, still shaking uncontrollably. Covered in about 5 blankets I kept waiting it out. And I?d say around 2-3am I could feel my fever breaking. By late morning my temp was back to normal but I felt achy still. Tired, sore. Definitely sore at my injection site. And I don?t know if this is worth mentioning or not but just haven?t been able to shake that panic attack feeling. Like a worry or a dread over me. I just don?t feel as clear-headed as I did before. This is my biggest concern. Just don?t feel myself yet.

Onset of severe chills/shaking, fluctuating temperature (no fever), horrible aches and pains, significant fatigue, and persistent headache from about 3am the morning after (on 1/8) and lasting until bedtime that day. The next morning (1/9),  most symptoms had resolved except for fatigue. I also experienced a new sx: severe pain and tightness in my chest/torso; was hard to breath normally and could not take a deep breath without experiencing significant pain. This lasted until about 3pm. Fatigue persisted the rest of the day. All symptoms had resolved by the next morning (1/10).

She did not notify anyone, and after her 15 minute wait, she went home.  Her respiratory symptoms worsened despite taking a dose of diphenhydramine.  At the urging of her family, she went to the ER four hours later, where she was evaluated.  No treatment was done, and she was told that she was having a mild reaction.  Her symptoms resolved after several hours.

Went back to sleep and woke up around 4 am with fever up to 100.6F, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, and extreme fatigue. My left axilla was swollen with arm pain to mid left chest and back, and my axillary lymph node was painful and swollen to about the size of a large grape. I took 440 mg of Aleve around 8:30 when the fever did not subside. The fever broke and did not return. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. My left axillary lymph node is still palpable as of today, 1/15.

                                                High fever 101.9 began the evening when I got my shot and as of an hour ago just came under the 100 mark. I?ve been taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours to combat high fever but it wasn?t going down. I had chills with the fever, so bad that my body was shaking. Fever stayed in the 101 range from Monday evening until Wednesday morning. Extreme shoulder pain radiating from left to right on Monday evening - lasted into the early morning on Tuesday. Chest tightness with R shoulder pain Tuesday afternoon from roughly 130p-315p. It subsided and so I did not seek medical attention. I?ve also had a severe migraine the entire time since getting my shot, but haven?t taken my Ubrelvy as I wasn?t sure how my body would react.

Rash on my arm where I received it went down to my elbow and up to my shoulder and on to my upper back, about 3 hours for it show up. It red, raised and bumpy and it felt hot. This lasted for 4 days. I was very pale and my eyes were sunken in. I literally felt like I was ran over by a vehicle.   I was sleeping for about 15 hours a day. I kept getting chills then I profusely sweats then it switch to freezing cold and back and forth between the two.  I took Tylenol and Benadryl to control symptoms but still felt miserable.  The symptoms all stayed with me to the end. I still do not feel 100%, I am still having ringing of the ears, moderate body aches and headaches. Someone else said they still see the rash but I cannot really tell.  I was also having trouble focusing for a few days after receiving the vaccine, I felt highly medicated not the fun high the bad high

                                                About 15 minutes after receiving vaccine symptoms started.  Nauseous, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, body aches (extreme), joint pain especially in hips and knees, extreme fatigue, headaches, ears constantly rang. Rash on my arm where I received it went down to my elbow and up to my shoulder and on to my upper back, about 3 hours for it show up. It red, raised and bumpy and it felt hot. This lasted for 4 days. I was very pale and my eyes were sunken in. I literally felt like I was ran over by a vehicle.   I was sleeping for about 15 hours a day. I kept getting chills then I profusely sweats then it switch to freezing cold and back and forth between the two.  I took Tylenol and Benadryl to control symptoms but still felt miserable.  The symptoms all stayed with me to the end. I still do not feel 100%, I am still having ringing of the ears, moderate body aches and headaches. Someone else said they still see the rash but I cannot really tell.  I was also having trouble focusing for a few days after receiving the vaccine, I felt highly medicated not the fun high the bad high.

                                                8 days after my  first vaccine shot, on Jan 19th night, I suddenly started having  pain in the chest. The pain was located in the left side of the lower end of the sternum, in the epigastric region. Pain lasted for 3-4 hours. Initially it was severe, pulsating, acute pain as if nerve pressing against chest. Unbearable pain. I was unable to lie down, turn on sides. Pain would aggravate on movements and if I would touch the specific spot in my chest. . Deep breaths reduced the pain to some extent. Pain severity decreased after 4 hours after which I started getting pain in my left arm, radiating to my pinky finger.  The pain also  radiates to left upper back on movements and exerting left arm for long time, especially typing computer keyboard, doing daily chores cooking, washing dirty dishes, sleeping on the side. ,I am unable to sleep on the left side, if I sleep on left side, I start getting tingling and numbness in my left arm. I did not take any pain medications until Jan 26th as the pain did not disappear. Once at night the pain also radiated to my left leg , I felt  numbness when I tried to sleep on my left side. Occasionally, I feel pain in my right arm and right back. The pain near the sternum area reduced significantly when I took two doses of Ibuprofen 600 on Jan 26th in the afternoon and night. The pain in left arm radiating towards left pinky still persists, with numbness and tingling  if I do daily task for longer duration. Ibuprofen helps to relieve pain temporarily.  Mild pain in right arm, neck and upper arm. I will continue to closely monitor my symptoms.

At 20 mins my throat felt tighter and it was making me cough trying to get air so they gave me 50 ml of benedryl into my right arm. I started to pass out and my breathing was labored so I was given my epipen and taken to the ER. While I was there I was monitored for 4 hours and given 2 more medications. One was a steroid, I?m unsure on the second.

                                                Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura; the only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 31-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via Intramuscular on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was seen in the ED for petechiae and ecchymoses on 15Jan2021. She had not taken any recent medication or had any illness previous to this event. The only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series. Lab assessment showed platelet count decreased to 22,000 cells per cubic microliter (normal over 140,000). She had no other findings to describe cause of her decreased platelet count by lab or clinical exam. Provided a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia purpura, in the ED setting, she started pulse dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four consecutive days with a follow blood count showing resolution on day 4 of her treatment with a platelet count of 230,000 cells per cubic microliter. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received Steroids as treatment. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of event immune thrombocytopenia purpura was recovered in Jan2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of immune thrombocytopenia purpura due to temporal relationship. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including platelet count at baseline and during therapy with subject drug, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.

I let the nurse know under observation and she took my vitals and my BP was high for me as well 146/85.  I waited for an hour and then had my husband pick me up.  The tingling continued for a week and a half and made it impossible to sleep.  It?s slowly gotten better, but I still feel almost a palpitation/flutter feeling.

I felt shaky  and like I was going to pass out. Very nauseous.  My blood pressure was 169/93 @ 0830. The staff had me lay down.  About  5 min later I started to feel better.  Another 5 min later it happened again in a wave. The symptoms just came over me. My blood pressure @ 0840 was169/104. The staff had me drink water and rest. @0900 the wave came over me again. My BP was 178/111. I drank more water and rested. BP recheck @ 0925 162/112.  @940 BP was slowly coming down at 145/109. At that time they transferred me to the Emergency room.  My BP came back into normal ranges, and the waves stopped happening around 12pm. I was then released home with plans to follow up with Primary care on  1/11/2021

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

She attributed this to excitement from completing vaccine series and finished her 15 minute wait time. She went home but it became harder to swallow and she felt like her chest was &#34;heavy&#34; and she became short of breathe walking up stairs. She took fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg and  filed a report with the CDC. Her symptoms resolved and she slept. The morning after her vaccine she felt fine and went for a 6 mile run. She called vaccine clinic to see what kind of follow up she needed to completed and was asked to contact PCP and employee health.  She presented to PCP that day (day after second vaccine) who reported ongoing symptoms of moderate chest tightness and some throat discomfort. Given prescription for Medrol dose pack, albuterol inhaler, and EpiPen and instructions on when to present for care.

A 32-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unknown route, on 12Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Relevant medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), hypothyroidism and anxiety. Past drug history included allergy to cefprozil (CEFZIL). Relevant concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN XL), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). On 12Jan2021, the patient had tachycardia, facial flushing, fatigue, arm pain and swelling. The events required a physician office visit. Therapeutic measures taken as result of the events included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). On 14Jan2021, the patient underwent a COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) which resulted positive. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 12Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 14Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                15 min after the vaccine I was flushed and felt hot , ears felt hot as well.  I had a  macular rash on chest and arms. My throat felt itchy and they immediately gave me benedryl.  I was tahycardic as well. When I got home from the ER that night I had to take more benedryl and then the next morning  I was still itchy and my voice was hoarse so I took more xyzal and famotidine.

                                                Several minutes after getting the shot, my chest started to feel tight and I needed to use my rescue inhaler.  I stayed at the Clinic until 30 minutes had been up. When I arrived home I needed to use my Albuterol Nebulizer Solution, and started to get slightly itchy. My chest didn&#39;t start to feel better until after 2am, and the next day I noticed my arm at the injection site was swollen and slightly red.  It is still red to this day and it feels achy all the way to my wrist.

She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

                                                12/20: 10 mins after the injection my arm started hurting so I was moving it around and suddenly a felt a tickle in my throat, swallowed and felt like I swallowed the wrong way and was coughing to the point of feeling like I was going to vomit. Per everyone around I was bright red and I looked weird. The ER nurse said my heart rate was 125 and my systolic BP was elevated at 130s (normally in the 110s). After sitting for 45 mins heart rate was back to 60s. Still felt like I was in a fog but felt ok. Once I walked to my car I felt alot of nausea again and was on and off the rest of the day.  In the middle of the night I woke up short of breath laying on my back had to lay on my side.  12/21. I was moving pavers and got short of breath. Checked my heart rate and it was 100. O2 sat was 99%. If I sat and didn&#39;t move I was fine as soon as I started moving it started again. Also felt nauseating all day. I was having a hard time concentrating and my husband was getting frustrated that I wasn&#39;t understanding what he was saying. My left arm hurt really bad all day  12/22 By the afternoon felt more normal except my arm still hurting really bad.  12/26 was shoveling dirty and suddenly my arm where I got the injection started hurts and I got very nauseated again.  On 12/29 the cdc called me because I did the vsafe program. They were wondering if I was actually going to get the second vaccination because they said my reaction is a severe reaction.  12/30 my arm started itching had chills and temp right after  1/1 rapid test was negative for covid  1/2 pcr was negative

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine I felt a rush of numbness/tingling/cold starting from my feet that worked it&#39;s way up to my head. Once the feeling got to my chest my HR increased.  Some SOA, suspected due to feeling of panic.  Feeling passed after about 3 minutes but kept coming back in waves about every 10-15 minutes.  Took Benadryl 25 mg at about 2:30 to see if it would help, symptoms calmed down at about 4:00.  The following morning on 1/30, the immediate symptoms had gone away.   By 1/30 evening, starting developing  constant numbness to BLE below knee. As of today, 2/4.  The numbness is still present.

A 33-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK4176 intramuscular in left deltoid on 07Jan2021 as single dose (at the age of 33 years) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Patient had history of ongoing Autoimmune Thrombocytopenia from May2020, ongoing migraines, depression/anxiety and ADHD, and COVID-19 21Apr2020 to &#34;05May2021&#34;.  Concomitant medication included Sertraline Hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), Lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE), Lorazepam  (Ativan), Ondasetron (ZOFRAN) and Sumatriptan succinate (IMITREX).  Historical information regarding dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 17Dec2020 included a moderate injection site reaction lasting 6 days worst on day three. Reaction was characterized by redness, swelling elevated rash surrounding injection site, aching pain radiating from neck to fingers and tenderness to palpitation.  1st dose Vaccine Lot Number: EJ1685, Vaccine Lot Expire Date: Mar2021, Time the Vaccination Was given: 08:00.  After the 2nd dose the patient experienced a moderate headache on 08Jan2021 12:00 for 1 day which responded well to APAP- caffeine and resolved on 09Jan2021 12:00 Patient had a flare up of my autoimmune thrombocytopenia as evidenced by legs covered in petechiae and bruising on 09Jan2021. Emergency room and physician office were not visited however, patient does have standing CBC orders from hematologist, so she had platelet count checked. It had dropped to 109K/uL, which is low for me but not dangerous. Patient originally developed autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) May2021 after COVID Apr2021. Both instances of these side effects were manageable, but patient wanted to report them as there was no data yet available on ITP with the vaccine when she met with hematologist to discuss it. Patient received Acetaminophen 650mg PO (per oral) as treatment.  Lab data included Platelets 13Oct2020 124 kiU/L (normal 140-400) and on 12Jan2021 109 KiU/L.  Event flare up of my autoimmune thrombocytopenia resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00, Platelets dropped to 109k resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00, legs covered in petechiae and bruising resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00 and headache resolved 09Jan2021.

                                                After receiving the first vaccine, started experiencing a little neck pain and swelling on and off for 2 month since first vaccination on December 30th. After second dose of Pfizer, the swelling and pain in the neck escallated and three nodules were discovered in my neck at ER visit due to pain from neck and radiating in ears and head. Extremely fatigued and headache was unbearable. ER MD discovered nodules, high white blood count, etc. Sent to follow up with Endo. Endo could not explain. Thyroid labs are all normal but the symptoms and nodules makes this suspicious. ANother ER visit with 3 days hospitalization due to pain and now elevated pulse (even while sitting in ER bed at 135-140 pulse). Low grade fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargic, elevated labs, etc.  Now on propranolol for heart regulation and prednisone to monitor. Multiple CT scans and Ultrasound confirmed the nodules.

This 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 15:15 at single dose on left arm for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to hepatitis B vaccine rhbsag (HEY B VACCINE) booster and poison ivy. Concomitant medication included biotin / calcium pantothenate / cyanocobalamin / folic acid / nicotinamide / pyridoxine hydrochloride / riboflavin / thiamine mononitrate (B COMPLEX), fexofenadine, ascorbic acid (VIT C) and Multivitamin. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Immediately after shot (29Dec2020 15:15), her tongue and lips tingled but it went away quickly. She was walking for a short distance and felt &#34;off.&#34; The patient checked her pulse and pulse ox and her heart rate (HR) was 180. Her HR had bounced around from 150-180 with minimal exertion and was in the 90s at rest. No treatment received for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The outcome of not recovered. The events were non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

Normal is 110s/60s-70s. No anxiety feelings.  -0740 throat started to have increased mucous production. Had the tickle and tightness in throat. Asked and received 25mg Benadryl with cup of water. -0742 started clearing throat frequently and slight cough. Knew it was anaphylaxis and told the team I need to go to the ER. Asked for additional 25mg Benadryl. Also took 20mg Famotidine and 2 puffs Albuterol inhaler--this is my prescribed anaphylaxis routine. Had Epipens on standby. -0743 put on O2 saturation monitor and watched O2 drop into 90-92 range. Asked for epipen on standby as I know when I need to start it. Didn&#39;t want to take that when I knew I was about to get it in the ER and knowing self hadn&#39;t progressed that far. Felt chest tightness and shortness of breath. Voice started becoming hoarse. -0800 EMS arrived (delay as team didn&#39;t know if they were supposed to call 911 or a Code--they chose EMS even though in hospital). Then staff at COVID vaccine clinic kept emphasizing need to go in ambulance while EMS and self fought to go through hospital (much quicker route). Finally cleared to go through hospital to ER. To get some air via breathing in had to sit up leaning forward. Voice completely hoarse by this time. -About 0817 arrived to ER bay. At this time, frequently coughing and cough started to sound stridorous. Difficulty getting breaths in. Had chest pain near heart. Greeted by MD, 2 RNS, and technician. -0819 received IM epinephrine. Attached to 5 lead EKG monitoring and O2 monitoring. Blood pressure done again. Higher than previous. -About 0821 had working IV (previous two attempts failed as veins were constricting). Given IV Solumderol. Started bolus of 1L Normal Saline. -Not sure how long after by cough subsided, increased mucous production subsided, as well as hoarseness decreased. -Held for observation for 2hours (would be longer if not resolved). - Discharged around 1015. At this time, hoarseness almost all gone. Minimal throat clearing. Cough resolved.  -Prescribed epipen inhalers (mine expired) and Prednisone. Prednisone is PRN for mild breathing difficulties if it starts again tomorrow 1/13/21.  -At 1400 took 50mg Benadryl and 20mg Famotidine as previously prescribed for anaphylaxis maintenance. Will continue this as previously prescribed every 6hours until symptoms stay resolved. -Made follow up appointment with Primary Care Physician per protocol

Later that morning 6:30am, I developed severe fatigue, dizziness upon standing and walking,  a L sided headache, L sided arm pain extending from elbow to sternocleidomastoid muscles on the L side, and axillary lymphadenopathy in the same arm as the vaccine (left). I took 650mg of Tylenol and went to work. Walking at a normal pace, my heart rate was 145. At rest inside the hospital it was in the 110s (measured by watch). the headache lasted all day on 1/9 and 1/10 and my neck felt slightly stiff (it was difficult to turn my head to look at traffic behind while driving). I took additional doses of Tylenol on 1/9 and 1/10 and by the AM of 1/11, all of my symptoms had resolved except for the L axillary lymphadenopathy.

She also felt shaking in her hands and her arms felt heavy.   She came back to the nurse that had administered her vaccine at 1:10pm where her oxygen level was monitored and she was given a cold cloth and water to drink. This lasted for about 20 minutes. Her oxygen level was monitored (~97%), her BP was checked at 1:45pm and it was 125/90. Her hotness, elevated HR, and shakes went away. At 2:00pm her BP was checked again and it was 139/96 and then again at 2:05pm where it was 132/90.   The patient stated that she felt fine and normal by now and also said that she had a BP cuff at work and at home and said that she would monitor it. All 3 of 3 follow up options discussed with patient: virtual care, the CDC, and/or 911 depending on her condition. The patient left at 2:15pm and patient was called 1 hour later for follow up.  On the follow-up call the patient stated that she was feeling fine and that her BP was 126/90. She said she would continue to monitor her BP and follow-up with virtual health if it wasn&#39;t back to normal by tomorrow.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (COIVD-19 Vaccine) , via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Crohn&#39;s disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 in 2020 to an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for Crohn&#39;s disease.  The reporter is a physician who is reporting and AE for a patient who received the vaccine and subsequently developed symptoms including short of breath, fever, headache, nausea, difficulty swallowing with seriousness criteria of Medically significant on 03Jan2021. The patient self-medicated with benadryl and symptoms resolved briefly but then went to urgent care with re-occurring symptoms and was prescribed prednisone. Caller states the patient&#39;s symptoms have resolved. She is calling to get more information to determine if the patient should receive the second dose. The reporter further stated that she has a patient who received her first shot, clarified as the COVID-19 Vaccine. About an hour and 45 minutes later, the patient had shortness of breath and then later had a fever, headache and nausea. It was later that night when the patient had a fever. The patient had difficulty swallowing which worsen; she was feeling as if her throat was closing. The patient is a nurse, so she self medicated with Benadryl. After taking the Benadryl, the patient was better in the early morning. When the doctor&#39;s office opened, the patient called and was having similar symptoms, clarified as all the symptoms mentioned above. The patient went to the urgent care where she received more Benadryl and was started on prednisone. Caller did not know the dose of prednisone the patient had received. After that, the patient started feeling better. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID19 Vaccine is due around 24 to 26Jan2021. The patient has not called the doctor/caller back. The caller assumes that the patient has recovered but could not be certain. Caller added that the patient also experienced chest tightness when she was having shortness of breath. The patient&#39;s fever was 101 on 03Jan2021. The patient was not drooling with her difficulty swallowing. Caller stated that the patient had a positive COVID test earlier, she thinks it was maybe 3 to 4 months ago (in 2020). The patient has not received another COVID test since she received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to the caller&#39;s knowledge. Reporting physician is an internal medicine physician.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular on 05Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Mild ADHD/ADD. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccination, she was standing in the observation room (where they had all of them stay for at least 15 minutes to ensure no severe reactions) and experienced a sudden onset of vertigo, tunnel vision and pre-syncope. Her hands became cold and numb and she was trying to talk to another staff member who was arranging/scheduling her second vaccination dose at the same time when this event occurred, but it subsided quickly and she started to feel normal again. All these events occurred at 12:45 on 05Jan2021. She reported this event right away and they had her stay in the room longer. She was stable at that point but experienced these symptoms again but very mildly twice more while she walked back to her car to go home. Other side effects on 05Jan2021 that started in the evening and for the following 2-3 days included fatigue, sore arm, leg/thigh aching, sniffles/sore throat, brief dry cough and slight headache/neck ache. Very mild and tolerable symptoms. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and the patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of all events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

We pulled into the waiting area and around five minutes after the injection the right side of my face went numb., the pain had left my arm and chest by the time.  The nurse reacted by calling the emergency room and sending me there.

Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

Was able to continue with regular workday as we determined it was best she stayed with other people for the remainder of the day.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                The evening of the day I got the shot, I began to get tired and started to have a sore arm.  Throughout the night, the arm soreness got worse and I got joint pain.  The whole next day, I experienced severe malaise, headache, chills, fever, and joint pain with the site soreness.    The arm pain got worse.  That night, I struggled to sleep.  The whole day after that, I had less malaise and the fever had gone down but the injection site reddened and grew even warmer and more tender.  That evening it was difficult to sleep as the soreness in my arm migrated to the shoulder, armpit and the right side of my chest, along where a bra band would go on the distal right side of the chest.  The next morning (today) the entire armpit area and upper distal right side of the chest were hot and tender.  This afternoon, I palpated the area and noticed at least one swollen lymph node.  My arm still hurts.

The following morning, I continued to have numbness in my hands but also in my face. By the evening , the day after I had received the vaccine, I felt like my swallowing was slightly impaired and I went to urgent care. I was able to complete all neurological tests and given a prescription for hydroxyzine, thinking that I may have had a slight histamine response.  I slept approximately 10 hours that night and then fell asleep again from 8:30-11:30 this morning due to high levels of fatigue. Today (~54 hours later), the numbness in my hands and face seems to be getting slightly worse.  I also feel some generalized weakness. I&#39;m still able to do normal day to day activities but it feels abnormal.

The cold heart sensation lasted for roughly 20-30 minutes. Following the start of the cold heart sensation, I became dizzy, sweaty, lost peripheral vision, had numbness in my fourth and fifth fingers (ring and pinky fingers) in both hands, and vaccination site attendant mentioned my hands looked red.

A 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on the left arm, on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included sinusitis, placenta accreta, infertility, caesarean section, seasonal allergy, sulfa allergy, and coriander allergy all from an unknown date. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone from an unspecified date. The patient previously took hydrocodone and experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL1284) on 30Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced left arm completely numb and tingling for 4 weeks. No other vaccines were given in four weeks. On an unspecified date after the second shot, it was reported that the patient experienced elevated BP of 166/99, nausea, heart palpitations HR 111, sweating, muscle cramps, swollen lymph nodes, dizzy, body weakness, fatigue, pain moving across the neck/chest/back, trouble sleeping, and pressure in chest. On 30Jan2021, 10 days after the second vaccination, the patient experienced splotchy skin. The events resulted in doctor clinic visit and emergency room care. The patient was given an unspecified treatment for the events. The patient was tested for COVID-19 post vaccination via nasal swab on 26Jan2021 with a negative result. The vaccine was administered in the workplace clinic. The outcome of the events were reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported elevated blood pressure cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                First vaccine I could feel the vaccine go into my body and down into my legs. It was a very strange sensation. I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on Thursday, morning (11Feb2021), at the time her arm hurt. She had body aches the entire Friday (12Feb2021) and headache; she stayed in bed all day and the next day, she took Tylenol. On Saturday (13Feb2021), she had shortness of breath and the urge to vomit (nausea), she was about to faint. She was also dizzy and checked her blood pressure, it was &#34;high&#34;, around 129/88, but she can&#39;t recall the values exactly. She doesn&#39;t know if she should get the second dose because she&#39;s scared. The patient wanted to know if these are symptoms from the vaccine or could it have been a reaction or allergy. She is scheduled for the second dose on 04Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Sat in my car working for about 8-10 minutes when a sudden rush of heat ran through my body.  I felt lightheaded, my tongue was prickly, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I was able to get back into the facility to let them know of the sudden symptoms.  At that time I felt like my heart was racing and was diaphoretic. They continued to watch me for another 15-20 minutes, they did have an epi pen but it was not given. I was feeling slightly better and then left again.  I waited in my car approximately 20 minutes before deciding it would be safe to drive away.  After driving for about 10 minutes I had another rush of heat, lightheadedness, and then I started having shortness of breath.  At this time it would have been about 1 hour, maybe longer, since receiving the vaccine.  I was not close to an emergency medical facility at that time, and did not feel like my throat was swelling so thought it would be best to try to drive to the nearest ER.  I knew I had an epi pen from my work that I could use if needed.  I contacted another nurse practitioner who I work with who stayed on the phone with me until I was able to get to a safe place.  At that time the symptoms had improved, not resolved.  It had been able 20 minutes during this episode.  In all, I continued to feel jittery for about 3-4 more hours.  Since my symptoms did improve I did not go to the ER.  I contacted my health department, Louisville health dept, the following day and reported symptoms to the medical director.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

After waiting in the monitoring area for 45 minutes I drank some water and felt like my bilateral upper thighs were difficult to lift when I tried to walk to my car. I went home and was tachycardic 120-130bpm that continued throughout the night to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep my heart was pounding so hard and fast. I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated all night.  I continued to have tachycardia for several days despite hydrating. My thighs also continued to feel week for several weeks. I developed a 100.7 F temperature and had flu like symptoms the following days.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

                                                Within an hour was feeling jumpy, easily startled, foggy thinking, fever (highest 101.6 normal temp is 97.5), unable to sleep for over 2 days (still haven?t slept partly due to extreme pain), extreme pain all over body especially on left side, racing heart (103 while laying down normal resting is 78), fever would not go down with any amount of fever reducer for 2 days (starting to slowly go down), sore throat, swelling in ankles and feet for two days (is going down now), congested nose, severe ear pain, joint stiffness and extreme ache.  Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

A 35-year-old female patient received second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021) intramuscularly on 12Jan2021 (between 8:30 to 9 am) at left deltoid for Covid-19 prevention. The first dose was received on Wednesday (unspecified date). Patient had no medical history and had no concomitant medications. At night of 12Jan2021, the patient had a fever of 102, but she went to bed with it and she woke up in the morning around 4:30 or 5 am (13Jan2021) in a pool of sweat, so she took her temperature and she was fever with 103.6. Patient took Motrin (Store Brand, lot number as either: 0GE2417A or OGE2417A, expiry: Apr2022) three 200 mg tablets, for a totally of 600 mg for the fever and had a cold shower, and the temperature came down to 103. Then after like 10-15 minutes of her laying on the couch with ice packs on her arms and stuff, it went down to 102.6. Patient was not going to go to the ER for just the fever, but then she started having heart palpitations, and she took her blood pressure and it was 170/113 and her heart rate was 176. Patient went to the hospital, and when they took her heart rate, it was 156. She had her blood taken at the hospital and everything was normal, except that her Potassium was a little low, it was 3. The ER did an EKG that showed Sinus Tachycardia and she was given IV Fluids (two boluses of 0.9% Normal Saline, 2000 mL total via IV, a bag of Potassium IV, two oral tablets of Potassium, unspecified total dose), and everything went back down. She had to call out from work that day and planed to follow up with her Primary Care Physician (PCP) in a couple of days. Patient was no longer had the fever, high blood pressure or high heart rate, as when she left the ER this morning, her temperature was 98, blood pressure was 111/82, and her heart rate was 96. She felt good now, but she did not know if it could happen again. Patient thought that it was maybe just her immune response to the vaccine, so she would say that she has recovered probably close to completely. Patient also had a headache and ringing in her ears, and those had resolved by now as well. The events Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure resolved on 13Jan2021 and other event resolved in Jan2021. The patient stated that the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) could have been serious with her blood pressure being so high, but it was not so serious because she did the right thing and went to the ER for treatment and got fluids. She believes the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) are medically significant. The patient believes that the events she experienced were directly caused by her receiving the vaccine, as she has never had these symptoms before other than she of course has had fevers in her life in the past.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

CDC Vsafe called and asked me to report as an adverse event though I wouldn&#39;t consider more serious than most. Had low grade fever (99-100) on tylenol, chills, rigors, myalgias and joint pains starting about 12 hours after vaccination.  Went to work the following day (I am an physician) and by about 10 am had a presyncopal event and was unable to stand/continue working. Was unable to stand without feeling faint for about the next 6 hours.  Was febrile until about 8pm 1/9, never over 100 while taking tylenol. Symptoms completely resolved by 1/10 AM except fatigue for the next 4 days or so, though I developed axillary lymphadenophathy on the side of vaccination starting 1/12 for about 5 days.  No effect whatsoever on the fetus.

She went to the ER; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. This nurse reported for a 35-year-old female patient (Daughter) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 Vaccine lot number: EK9231, Expiry date: Apr2021) on 16Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported was She was positive, our whole family had COVID and we all came down which was about the same time which was 29Dec. Concomitant drug were not reported. Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am calling for my daughter. She received her 2nd vaccination yesterday morning and she had some side effects. Like about 6 o&#39;clock this morning she came in, she came in 6:35, she came and woke me up and said that she felt some of the reaction she is having. She has nausea, she has slight temperature 99.7, fatigue. Just a general feeling of aches and pains. It does not seem like it&#39;s an emergency. She was treated in the ER with steroids and since that point we have all recovered until she went for the 2nd. She works in a hospital, she got her 2nd dose of vaccine like I said yesterday morning. &#34;Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am not sure causality. I mean it is not an emergency. She was feeling fine yesterday. We all are feeling better now. She had the vaccine and last night she said she had a sore throat when I looked at her throat. Her throat seemed red but there was no angioedema or anything like that, she went to sleep and she came in &#39;feeling really&#39; (voice distortion) sick. So, I do not know. Did they have relapses from the COVID? I do not know.&#34; Treatment was &#34;Tylenol.&#34; Like I had said that she was feeling heavy with her chest. She went to the ER. She was at her work. She went to the ER.&#34; &#34;Probably close to 10 days ago, they did lab work I think they might have been looking for a clot. They did do some lab work at the hospital with unknown results.&#34; Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

I also had a metal taste in my mouth. Before the rapid heart rate started, j bad chills, diarrhea and slight body aches. For about four to five hours my heart rate resting would be 60&#39;s and when a spell came on it would rise up to high 90&#39;s. It did this off and on every couple of minutes for about four to five hours. It was a very scary situation to be in: I can handle the chills, bod aches and diarrhea but when it comes to my heart rate bouncing around and taking my breath away, that was scary.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wed night 1/31/21 at 5:50pm. I had no prior recent illnesses prior to getting the shot. About 24 hours later, developed fevers/chills, body aches, headaches, and fatigue, and a notable pain in the front of neck -- felt like tender thyroid. Temp was 100.3F on Thursday night 1/14. Took ibuprofen and went to bed. Next day felt fine, went to work, but symptoms returned on Friday night without fever. Symptoms persisted through the weekend without fever until Sunday AM 1/17/21 at 3:40am, I woke up with a temp of 101.7F. Went to get tested for COVID on Sunday 1/17/21 and Tuesday 1/19/21. Both times were negative (both rapid and PCR). Remained febrile on Monday and Tuesday AM. Went to urgent care on Monday 1/18/21 and was negative for flu, but provider observed the thyroid was tender. TSH was checked on 1/18/21 and was abnormal, 0.027 and FT4 was 3.20. Had virtual appt with PCP on 1/19/21, and she ordered more blood tests to evaluate the hyperthyroidism. On 1/21, repeat TSH was 0.014, and FT4 and T3 were both high. Inflammatory markers were elevated, liver function tests were mildly elevated, but thyroid antibodies were all negative. Over the course of the week after getting the shot, I experienced tachycardia, palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with simple tasks like walking up a flight of stairs or getting up from the couch to walk to the kitchen. PCP ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate the dyspnea on exertion, but it was normal. I had radioactive iodine uptake thyroid scan performed on 2/3 and 2/4, and it was notable for markedly low 24-hour uptake, consistent with Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, or other types of thyroiditis. As of 2/5/21, I am feeling significantly better from the past 3 weeks, and the hyperthyroid symptoms have improved and flu-like symptoms have resolved. Due to possible relation to the vaccine, I have delayed the 21-day booster shot to 23 days, and plan to get it this afternoon 2/5/21.

Around 9:45 started preparing for the next day (getting coffee pot ready, etc.) up until this moment I had no side effects except pain in my arm.  Then at 9:45PM I began feeling light headed, ringing in my ears and fell unconscious. I woke up on my kitchen floor in a small pool of blood and disoriented. I do believe this reaction is related to the vaccine. I DO NOT have a history of fainting. I ate food and drank plenty of water throughout the day and after my vaccine injection. Everything about my day was typical except for the vaccination and losing consciousness.

Medical history included mixed connective tissue disease diagnosed in 2019, autoimmune disorder and anxiety from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included diazepam (VALIUM) taken for anxiety, start and stop date were not reported; paracetamol (TYLENOL A) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; ibuprofen (ADVIL [IBUPROFEN]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps (arrhythmia) on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered  sob and dates for getting really winded (dyspnoea)  on Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, her heart was racing on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really winded on 22Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, for the 4-5 days after receiving her covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30am since it started on 20mar2021 with outcome of unknown, extremely thirsty on 20Mar2021 with outcome of unknown,  low grade fevers  on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, severe allergic reaction on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Additional details were provided as: &#34;I started having a reaction within 12 hours of the shot that persisted. Four (4) days after I was at urgent care and was sent to see a cardiologist due to SOB and heart rate jumps that were happening.&#34; In the past two weeks the patient has seen the cardiologist, had ekgs and echos completed and and now is being sent to see an electrophysiologist. The cardiologist wants her to postpone the second dose until she sees the electrophysiologist since he doesn&#39;t know if this is exacerbation of something or was caused by the vaccine. She had her first dose on 19Mar2021 around 12:45PM-1:00PM in the afternoon. After her vaccine she was ok. She had actually taken a Valium before she went to get the Covid 19 vaccine because she was nervous. She doesn&#39;t know if taking the Valium before getting the Covid 19 vaccine had anything to do with her delayed reaction. She does not take the Valium every day. She woke up around 1:30AM Saturday morning, 20Mar2021 and her heart was racing. Her mother is a nurse and her mother came over the next day to monitor her. Her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps. Even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s. (beats per minute) She and her mother monitored her heart for a while and she called the clinic where she received the Covid 19 vaccine and the nurse told her to go to an Urgent Care. She does report she has an autoimmune disease and she was wondering if she was having a flare up that the Covid 19 vaccine had caused. She could not find a doctor to talk to her about it. Even her primary care doctor wouldn&#39;t help her. Everyone told her to go to an Urgent Care or the emergency room. On Monday, 22Mar2021, she tried to get up and move around but she was getting really winded. She was trying to do things she normally does like walking in her backyard or walking down the hallway. On Tuesday, 23Mar2021 she went to the urgent care. The urgent care did an EKG and told her she needed to see a cardiologist. She was able to see a cardiologist the next day on Tuesday, 24Mar2021. The cardiologist had her wear a Holter monitor to monitor her heart rate for 24 hours. The results showed that she was having arrhythmias, heart rate jumps. The cardiologist did more EKG&#39;s and an echocardiogram. The cardiologist wants her to see an electrophysiologist because of what he saw on the Holter monitor. She is asking if it&#39;s possible that she had a heart issue before and the Covid 19 vaccine brought it to the surface. She&#39;s read things online where people have had similar symptoms. Is it a side effect? She would also like to report that for the 4-5 days after receiving her Covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30AM since it started on 20Mar2021. She&#39;s unsure if she should get the second Covid 19 vaccine. Her second appointment is scheduled for this Friday, 09Apr2021. When she woke up that morning of 20Mar2021 she was extremely thirsty. She reports she does not drink alcohol because of her autoimmune disease, but the thirst she experienced felt like she had been drinking alcohol and was experiencing the extreme thirst that comes with a hangover. The first 5 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine were the worst and that&#39;s why she decided to go to the urgent care. Her heartrate hasn&#39;t improved. Her windedness had improved by the tenth or eleventh day. She can go on a walk and jump up and down with her daughter now. The windedness is lingering a little but is definitely improved. Her autoimmune disease is called Mixed Connective Tissue. She takes no medications for it. She manages it with her diet. Her mother had called her rheumatologist on call on Monday night, 22Mar2021 and asked him is there anything the caller can do or anything she can take. The rheumatologist on call told her to take Aleve.  She didn&#39;t take Aleve but she did take Tylenol and then hours later she took Advil. She does normally run low grade fevers with her autoimmune disease. The fevers are never high, usually around 99.8F never going over 100F. The low grade fevers have been occurring prior to the Covid 19 vaccine for years. She reports that after she took the Tylenol (Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg, she took 2 tablets) and then the Advil (Advil 200mg, she took 1 tablet), she felt drugged, like totally out of it. So tired she couldn&#39;t move. And she&#39;s taken those medications before and never felt like that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: arrhythmias, heart rate jumps   on 23Mar2021. No follow-up attempts are possible; no further information expected.

Next thing she knew, she woke up on the floor and had a huge bump on her head near her left eye. She passed out and hit her head on the tile in the bathroom. Her left eye was half swollen shut, her eyelid and under eye were black, was very swollen all over her head and eye and was in lots of pain. She went to the emergency room around 04:30. All tests, CT scan and blood work came back normal. She was told that it was most likely caused by the vaccine. Treatment for the events included &#34;CT scan, bloodwork, IV fluids&#34; (as reported). She was hoping that Pfizer will pay for her ER visit since the events were vaccine reactions. She reported that she was still in lots of pain and was not taking pain meds because she was breastfeeding. The events resulted to emergency room and physician office visits. The outcome of pain was not recovered. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021442302 Baby case

It was the worst the first 2-3 days after the vaccine. It has improved somewhat, but is still not fully resolved and my improvement seems to have pleatued in the past few days. It is not debilitating nor a deterrent for me getting my 2nd dose, but I felt compelled to report my symptoms as I don&#39;t see dizziness and palpitations listed as a possible side effect.

Even laying down had the room spinning. It has not been consistent and has improved as the day has gone but has yet to go away.

                                                - Almost immediate onset of nausea, sore throat, headache, and sensation of fast heart rate; along with feelings of mild illness (like a cold) and arm pain which is consistent with other vaccination response.   - Waited at clinic for 30 minutes as directed due to previous history of anaphylaxis to injected meds (among others). Reported feeling poorly to nurse monitoring people waiting at 30 minute mark, who encouraged waiting longer but did no further assessment. Waited another 15 minutes with no resolution or improvement. Decided to leave and monitoring staff said they could not keep patients if they wanted to leave.   - Approximately 15 minutes later (1hr after injection), took one 25mg Benadryl liquid gel as nausea/headache/fast heart rate were consistent with prior allergic reaction and not with prior vaccine response. Those symptoms resolved after 1-2 hours; the feeling of mild illness lingered for approx. 3 days more.

A 36-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK5730) dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 11:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included von willebrand&#39;s disease, narcolepsy with cataplexy, IIH (Idiopathic intracranial hypertension), HTN (hypertension), GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), migraines. Patient also had known allergies: PCN (penicillin), shellfish, IV contrast, cefdinir and bees. On 23Dec2020, patient got nerve blocks for her migraines. Throughout the day patient was cough and her face started flushing so she tooled diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). Around 22:30, patient felt like her throat was closing and she was choking. She had chest pain, chest tightness. EMS (emergency medical services) was called and patient was brought to the hospital. On 25Dec2020, patient felt like her throat was closing, like someone was sitting on her chest and chest tightness still with chest pain. Very SOB (shortness of breath) at rest. Patient went to the ER (emergency room) and received IV dexamethasone (DECADRON) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride. On 26Dec2020, patient had the same symptoms but with severe facial flushing and patient went back to the ER and was given IV dexamethasone. Patient was sent home on a maximum amount of medications. I had seen her primary care, ENT (ear nose throat centre), Allergy, ID (infectious disease), and pulmonology. Her CT (computerised tomogram) of chest on 25Dec2020 was negative along with her COVID test. Patient SOB on rest and exertion still. Onset date of the adverse events was reported as 23Dec2020, 22:30. Patient received treatment for the events included multiple medications and high dose prednisone. Lab data on 25Dec2020 included CT of chest: negative, influenza type A/B combo: negative, Covid 19: negative and nasal swab: negative. Action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship.  The clinical presentation of the events is suggestive of possible allergic reactions. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Felt like it spread through my body,  I felt a weird feeling in my chest, throat, my legs felt weak, I was light headed and my heart started to beat hard and fast. It then started to subside over several minutes. The nurse kept me for 30 minutes and then I felt ok to walk out. I had a bit of a headache and didn?t feel right the rest of the night.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

Within 10 minutes I had tachycardia (130s), high BP (160s), lightheadedness, nausea, headache, and feeling like I was going to faint. I was attended to by Ambulance paramedics. At the time of her report to her primary care provider on 1/7/2021, she was still having pretty significant side effects (headache, dizziness, and light sensitivity), enough so that I was staying home from work. These symptoms have now resolved.

Then over the next few days, she started to notice tingling and a &#34;prickly&#34; sensation in various areas.  This progressed to symmetric BLE weakness which started in her feet and had reached to just above her knees bilaterally time and she arrived.  The weakness had progressed to her hips.  She also noticed weakness in her arms and they are easily fatigued.  She is able to walk but it takes much effort.

                                                Patient experienced a syncopal episode post vaccination, accompanied by feeling hot and tachycardic. Prior to the syncope, she reported hyperventilating. She remained unresponsive for about 10 minutes and was brought to the ED. There she became responsive, and reported chest pain and had sinus tachycardia episodes. She also had lower extremity weakness. This has improved per the latest neurology notes. She also had a negative EEG. Unsure if this is an allergic reaction or if the syncope was due to hyperventilation.  Patient is currently on day 3 of hospitalization.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the booster dose, she awoke feeling extremely ill and nauseous, roused me to say so, and then immediately became unresponsive and pulseless. She was admitted to hospital for cardiac work up, and all diagnostic tests have found her heart to be normal in structure and function. Cardiology believes she experienced a vasovagal syncope with asystole. She remains hospitalized at this time for initiation of sotalol therapy; she was diagnosed with frequent PVCs approximately 1 year ago.

                                                My first dose of COVID vaccine I didn&#39;t have any symptoms (1st dose: 12/23/20). Received 2nd dose at 0800 on 1/12/21. First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine (approximately 17 hours post-dose), I got up to use the restroom.  While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

Later I got really weak and shaky, fatigued, that night I woke up with night sweats, and chills, woke up completely drenched, I had to change the sheets and pajamas. 5 days after the vaccine I was really exhausted, the fatigue was awful. There was also an itching sensation but no hives.

                                                Patient developed feeling of &#34;burning in mid-chest&#34; and palpitations 15 minutes after COVID vaccine administered. She also experienced intermittent tingling in hands and feet. Patient was evaluated by EMS in the vaccine clinic. The chest symptoms were episodic, occurring every 5 minutes and lasting 1-2 minutes with each episode. Intermittent dizziness also occurred during the chest-discomfort symptoms. Vital signs were stable and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.  Patient denied SOB, stridor and no labored breathing. Patient was transported to the hospital emergency department for further evaluation/observation. After 2 hours of observation, patient&#39;s symptoms resolved spontaneously.

Then throughout the night symptoms worsened with significant body chills despite multiple layers, severe body pain and migraine trigger. In the morning felt like full-blown flu with fever of &gt; 100 F, sensitive skin painful to the touch, cold sweats, full body pains, heart palpitations (pounding heart beats and ave 100-120 bpm), and migraine level 8/10. Medication required to try to treat symptoms (metoclopramide, claritin, excedrin). Symptoms continued and did not start to lessen until approximately 30 hours post vaccine dose (18 hours post severe symptom initiation) and two doses of medication regimens. Arm around injection site also showed raised, red irritation local to the site, however, was not exacerbated throughout the symptom course. COVID call center recommended for me to see emergency care facility due to symptoms which I waited to see if symptoms worsened before deciding to not go to the urgent care center.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 14:45 at 36-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  Medical history included Wilms tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, Kidney resection and chemo from 1986 to an unknown date, sulfonamide allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 21Dec2020. On 12Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced vasovagal syncope with asystole (hospitalization, medically significant).  The patient was hospitalized for vasovagal syncope with asystole on unknown dates for 4 days (at the time of the report). It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment due to the events. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient experienced what was believed to be a vasovagal syncope with asystole; approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose. The patient had been admitted to the hospital since all cardiac diagnosis tests were negative for structural or functional abnormalities. The patient remained in-patient at this time for initiation of therapy for frequent PVCs, which were diagnosis about one year ago; but chose not to treat at that time, as the symptoms were not affecting her lifestyle. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac diagnosis tests: negative for structural or functional abnormalities on an unknown date.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination; and was not tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the vasovagal syncope with asystole cannot be excluded. The event is confounded by the patient&#39;s underlying premature ventricular contractions.

A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 11Jan2021 15:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism, asthma, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, chronic allergies, gastritis, and walnut allergy. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), metformin, loratadine (CLARITINE), spironolactone, and calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 2000). The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 21Dec2020 15:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient verbalized, &#34;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related but I figured I should report just in case. I have had severe lymph node swelling on the right side where I got the vaccine. 24hrs post 2nd vaccination I have had a sudden onset of an extremely violent cough. By sudden onset, I mean I had no desire to cough and over about 30 min I developed the severe need to cough. My sputum is greenish/yellow brown with blood flecks. I&#39;ve never experienced such a violent cough with so much sudden sputum production. I am using an Albuterol inhalor to help chest tightness.&#34; Clinical outcome of chest discomfort was unknown while for the other events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a close chronological association, a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded.

                                                Started with some nausea around noon on 1/18 that resolved, then experienced nausea without emesis and palpitations while driving to work at 1800. She describes it as feeling like her heart was racing, but also feeling like she was having large pauses in her heart rate in between the palpitation sensations. She drank a bottle of water and the feeling went away temporarily but it returned.  I am an employee, on arriving to work I noted increased shortness of breath which is unusual for me because I am an avid runner and very active. I noted the palpitations from around 1800-2000, including becoming dizzy and lightheaded during my shift which could endanger patient care, so I presented to the ED and was placed in the CCA. I had received both covid vaccines, second one on 1/11/21 and had about 20H malaise/fatigue and some expiratory wheezing which was abnormal for her but all has since resolved. I had intermittent heart palpitations and chest until 1/26

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

She screamed.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

A 36-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 20Jan2021 16:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot EH9899) on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. On 20Jan2021 the patient had headache with outcome of recovering, general malaise, muscle pain and muscle spasms in neck with outcome of not recovered, numbness in hand and arm with outcome of unknown. On 21Jan2021 the patient experienced chills with outcome of recovered in Jan2021 and fever with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, neck was very stiff, skin irritation, like achiness from wearing clothes with outcome of unknown. The patient experienced also exhausted, pain, on Jan2021 with outcome of unknown and high blood pressure (she was normally 105/60, and in the ER she was 170/101) on 23Jan2021 with outcome of unknown. Clinical course was as follows. The patient began to develop the following symptoms: headache, numbness in hand and arm, and muscle spasm in neck. The patient was working and had some patients the day following vaccination, and her headache got much worse, the muscle spasms and pain were worse, and all of a sudden she got skin irritation, like achiness from wearing clothes, and she realized she had a bit of a fever. Chills have gone away, she did not feel those. Muscle aches, especially the muscle spasms on her neck into the shoulder have not. Fever went away that day, she took Tylenol, and after she took it, she got home from work, and was better that evening from chills and fever, she has recovered completely from fever. She was in so much pain, she was feeling overall exhausted. She had headaches the day of the injection. She thought she had slept wrong, possibly the night before, so she didn&#39;t think of it, until symptoms worsened. She went to emergency room on 23Jan2021 due to severity of the muscle spasms in neck, so the doctor was worried about stenosis, or like impingement of spinal cord, but the CT scan on 23Jan2021 was negative for structural reasons, so she was prescribed a muscle relaxer and one for pain and inflammation. The patient was given Tramadol and Norophlex at the ER via injection in each arm. After receiving injections she reported that she developed a severe reaction in both arms, she cannot move her arms, it was extremely painful, like she had surgery on both sides and her neck was very stiff. Her arms were now weak, very painful, and she could not lift her arms. She has had Tramadol in the past, never had pain, but this was worse than labor. Her left arm felt like it would explode when he injected it, and now she can barely move both arms, she has not been able to move her arms, and the hospital doesn&#39;t know why, this is not a response from those medications. Headaches were the same intensity, but better from when she went to the ER. They were now a 7 out of 10 and in the ER were a 10 out of 10. When she got chills, she had an intense stiffness in her neck, muscle pain across shoulders to upper back, and it varies in intensity, she&#39;s been laying down the last day and a half, today was tolerable, but when she went to the ER on Saturday, it was so extreme she thought she had a nervous breakdown, it was a lot of pain, she didn&#39;t know if that contributed to her elevated blood pressure, or was something separate.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot # EL8982, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Jan2021 12:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  There were no relevant medical history or concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products.The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.On 21Jan2021, exactly &#34;4 1/2 days&#34; after vaccine the patient experienced fainting like episodes, blurred vision, severe vertigo, chest pain, fatigue. The patient has been out of work since the 20th and she still had blurred vision. The adverse event resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received. The patient was not recovered from the events. She has been to the ER, cardiologist for an echography, ultrasonography of thyroids, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her head, went to ENT dr and neurologist in 2021. All blood work in 2021 came back normal as well. The reporter considered the event as non-serious. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. She had negative Nasal Swab Covid test post vaccination on 22Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainting like episodes cannot be fully excluded.

A 36-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose on 05Feb2021 12:30 for Covid-19 immunisation, being a caregiver.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received flu vaccine for immunization and had side effects. On 06Feb2021 she woke up feeling unwell a few hours before reporting. Reporter and patient went for a 4 mile walk and she felt sluggish during the walk and her heart was racing, hands were shaking and she felt as if she was going to faint. When they arrived back home the reporter checked her heart rate and it was not that high and her symptoms were subsiding. The reporter would like to know if his wife should go to the ER. A few years before the patient had side effects from the flu vaccine so he was expecting her to have a reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included heart rate: it was not that high on 06Feb2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. The reporter assessed the events as not serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

Due date was 2/8/21 but I delivered via scheduled csection on 2/2/21. Birth weight was 6lb 10oz. Delivery uncomplicated.  History of severe atypical preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome in LAST pregnancy in 2018-2019.   This pregnancy was complicated by obesity, otherwise uncomplicated.  When I developed headache, I checked my BP, which was elevated to 140/90. Talked to my OB/GYN via phone. Was instructed by healthcare provider to check urinalysis in the office in which I work, which was negative for proteinuria. My elevated BP resolved within a few hours.

At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 36-years-old; Batch/Lot number and expiry date were not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient fainted on 02Mar2021 and recovered from the event on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She doesn&#39;t know how she would be if she wasn&#39;t warm, she thinks the fact that she is warm, the shaking has subsided. Later, last night, around 2 or 3 the headache was piercing, her head was hurting so bad like someone was taking a nail in her left temple. If it was a stroke she would have dealt with it if she had someone there with her to help her deal with it. She has a horrible headache today. The patient stated that now it is like a regular migraine. It sounded crazy to say , but now it she stated that it was like a regular migraine, it has improved and no longer feels like she is having a stroke. The patient took two Tylenol yesterday for the headache and vomited pretty quickly after so she doesn&#39;t think she got much of it. She has not taken anything else because she does not have anything on her stomach so she does not want to take more Advil or whatever but she would like to, her head hurts really bad, she would love some pain relief. The projectile vomiting went until there was just bile. She did not eat very much yesterday. She is no longer actively vomiting, but she felt herself wanting to dry heave but feels there is nothing else to give. The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t eaten anything today so she does not know if she can keep anything down and doesn&#39;t have much water in her system. The outcome of the event headache was recovering while the outcome of other events was unknown. Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 06Apr2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3246) (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included topiramate (TOPAMAX) at 250 mg, daily (2 DF 100mg and 1 DF 50mg at bedtime) taken for migraine, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received fist dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 27Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that since the second vaccination experienced tachycardia, palpitation, shortness of breath and basically blasting of air, difficulty breathing, dizziness and weakness, all on 18Jan2021. She reported pulse keeps raising, elevating to 148-157, she had palpitation complications without doing anything straight away. Elevated pulse and tachycardia, that all started and that was very concerning, pulse went to 209 and that was when she got transported to the emergency room. The patient reported also syncope episodes, costochondritis and chest pain on Jan2021.  On 26Mar2021 the patient experienced having discoloration on her toes, numbness and tingling and that her extremities, from the knee down and both her hands and feet were cold, ice cold. The patient was transported to the hospital by ambulance three times due to the events (hospitalizations on 22Jan2021, 30Jan2021 and 25Mar2021). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Troponin, D dimer, electrocardiogram (EKG), Chest X ray, Full blood count (CBC), exercise electrocardiogram (TMT) all resulted: normal, nuclear stress test: unknown results and pulse 148-157, 209,  all on unspecified date. The patient outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the tachycardia and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her daughter. This is the second of two cases.  A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) via intramuscular route administered in arm  on 13Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose (dose 1) and then via intramuscular route administered in arm on 03Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose (dose 2), for COVID-19 immunization. Patient has received both doses of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Medical history included Down&#39;s syndrome from 15Sep1984, morbid obesity and asthma since 2011 (Diagnosed 10 years ago), all were ongoing; and not a smoker/former smoker. Ongoing concomitant medications included loratadine (CLARITIN), paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL) and birth control. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 09Apr2021, the patient tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021. On the same day on 09Apr2021, the patient experienced hypoxia, fatigue, fluid in both lungs, loss of appetite and she wasn&#39;t feeling well. The patient (who had Downs Syndrome not that it matters but it is a co-morbidity/ Daughter has downs) and the patient&#39;s mother (reporter) had their second doses on 03Apr2021 which was a Saturday and her daughter ended up in the hospital on Friday 09Apr2021 and tested positive for Covid. The patient was admitted with hypoxia. The patient&#39;s mother has questions for the timelines for their infections. She doesn&#39;t know if they were possibly infected before they got the second vaccine and were asymptomatic and unknown or did they get infected when got they got the vaccine thousands of other people. The patient&#39;s mother stated that it has mostly resolved now, and they were all home. It started with fatigue and loss of appetite and she wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she took her to the doctor at 08:00 and she was at the emergency room (ER) by 08:30 and hospitalized from 09Apr2021 to 13Apr2021. The events required visit to Emergency Room and Physician&#39;s office. Treatment included Remdesivir, Steroid Injection and Oxygen. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Data Capture Aid included the following information: The patient had a positive test for SARS-CoV2. It was unknown if the patient had SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. The patient was hospitalized from 09Apr2021 to 13Apr2021. The patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at hospital discharge. The patient displayed clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness including Oxygen Saturation on Admission was 83% on Room Air. The patient required supplemental oxygen (including high flow or ECMO). New or worsened symptoms/signs during the COVID-19 illness experienced (including date of onset/worsening) were Respiratory: Hypoxia, Fluid in Both Lungs and Dyspnea. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19 including 5 Doses of Remdesivir starting 09Apr2021 and ending 13Apr2021. The reporter stated that she thinks they gave her a steroid injection in the ER. The event did not require the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. The patient&#39;s outcome with COVID-19 was recovering. Patient has not had a repeat test. The patient had numerous Lab work.  The patient was not a smoker/former smoker. The patient was taking medications routinely prior to the event being reported including Paxil, Claritin and Birth Control Pill. Pre-existing diseases worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection including Asthma. The patient was not treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient underwent lab test and procedures including a Covid Test: Positive on 09Apr2021. The relatedness of drug to the events &#34;Tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021, Hypoxia, Fatigue, Fluid in Both Lungs&#34; was unknown (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter/ Method of assessment: Global Introspection). Causality was unknown because she doesn&#39;t know when they were exposed to the Covid. The reporter thinks the vaccine lessened their symptoms. Reporter seriousness for &#34;Tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021, Hypoxia, Fluid in Both Lungs (medically significant)&#34; was serious (hospitalization from 09Apr2021 to 13 Apr2021). Events Fatigue and Loss of Appetite were assessed as not serious by reporter. The outcome of the events Hypoxia, Fatigue, Fluid in Both Lungs, Loss of Appetite, she wasn&#39;t feeling well, COVID-19, dyspnea and Asthma aggravated was recovering and unknown outcome for the other event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, vaccination failure of the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. Events hypoxia, pulmonary edema and dyspnea are attributed to Covid-19 infection and considered unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).

A non-pregnant 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: Unknown), intramuscularly in the left arm on 19Dec2020 at 37-years-old at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included intermittent asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: mild asthma attack on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, moderate dyspnea on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, chest pressure on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, a 4-5 cm area of induration in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, mild erythema in her left deltoid area in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown. The patient had intermittent asthma with no attacks in the past six years. Two days after the vaccination, she had a mild asthma attack when she was walking up stairs. For the past two days, she has had multiple asthma attacks, with moderate dyspnea and chest pressure present for most of the day. The patient&#39;s symptoms have been improving with her as needed (PRN) salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. The physician saw the patient in a telemedicine visit and found her to have an asthma exacerbation; therefore, prednisone was prescribed. The patient had no symptoms of viral infection and reported testing negative for COVID-19 after the onset of her asthma symptoms. The physician suspected her asthma exacerbation to have been caused by the vaccine because she had been symptom-free in recent years and she has not had a new exposure other than the vaccine. In addition to her respiratory symptoms, the patient had a 4-5 cm area of induration and mild erythema in her left deltoid area; this appeared about 1 week after she received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild asthma attack, moderate dyspnea, chest pressure. The patient, since the vaccination, had been tested for COVID-19. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Two weeks after vaccination, I had an increased of fatigue and not feeling well, accompained by a fever of (101.5 F) and chills, sore throat, and lethargy.  My symptoms of fever, chills, sore throat, body aches, congestion, and fatigue remained over the next few days and soon included chest pain and some increase work of breath.  With two negative Covid tests through work, it was recommended I go to see a physician, who instead sent me to Immediate Care.  There I had an EKG which showed sinus bradycardia and they sent me to ER due to my symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath.   At the ER, multiple tests were run to negative results.  ER Physician suspects that some of my struggles could be related to Covid vaccine but that I also may have caught an non-Covid virus on top of it which led to acute bronchitis.

Extremely benign -  for 24 and 25th - dull headache and arm at injection site was sore. 27th - all of a sudden I had an elevated resting heartrate - 140 - would go up and down and when it was down it didn&#39;t go to normal -  it went to 90s and my resting heart rate is in 60s.  And also had chest tightness, shortness of breath and fatigue. Went to ER  That all lasted for 10 days. Fatigue aspect got better; the heartrate slowly started getting a little better. Chest tightness and shortness of breath - even when heartrate went down a little, I was still experiencing those symptoms anyway. Off and on thing for 10 days. Last 10 days - have significant improvement. Due for 2nd dose tomorrow - dr has advised I hold off.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

It slowly began to progress to my legs, torso, and feet by 8:30pm.  The rash was raised, hot, and red. Blanchable to touch and extremely itchy.  I used Benadryl 50mg (taken at 8:45pm) and hydrocortisone cream to alleviate the rash. This helped until  Monday 1-18-21 at 06:00am. The rash began to return so I took another  50mg of Benadryl. The rash again cleared until 10:00am, at which point I scheduled a virtual visit through portal. I was prescribed prednisone and Famotidine. The rash continues to reappear once the Benadryl has worn off.  Today I have taken one dose of  prednisone and  a total of 3 doses of Benadryl.

I was taken to the Urgent Care who sent me to the ER because I was having throat issues.  The urgent care had given me 2 benedryls  before going to the ER.   I sat there several hours in the ER but was never seen and went home because I had begun to feel a little better.  The next day I had to take benadryl in the morning and the afternoon because I still felt the sensation where my face felt a little stiff and shortly after the symptoms began to subside. I had a little body aches and sore throat but they were very minor.

Continuing to take Atarax every 6 hours per MD order.

                                                Symptoms reported by patient  Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 @ 0950.  Vaccine was given on side of left arm.  On the evening of 1/5 I started to not feel well.  I had a runny nose, headache, nausea, and fatigue.  The injection site on my left arm was red, warm, and swollen with a knot/ball that could be felt underneath.  I also had moderate pain at injection site.  This was about the size of a half dollar.  On the morning of 1/6 I still didn&#39;t feel well.  I received a call from my mom that she tested positive for COVID and although I did not have much contact with her there was one day on 12/26 that I saw her outside for about 15 minutes (masked).  I called employee health with all of this as it was hard to separate the exposure from symptoms of the vaccine.   I did express some concerns over having a vaccine reaction but was told the symptoms I was having would be normal.  I was tested for COVID, which was negative.  Over the next few days symptoms got better but I did have nausea on and off until the morning of 1/11.  Redness at injection site, swelling and pain were resolved by 1/11 as well.  On Friday 1/15 I woke up and my injection site was red, warm, swollen, and had pain again.  This was about the size of a quarter.  There was also a hard area that could be felt under the skin.  My arm hurt with radiating pain into my wrist.  I thought maybe it was just random and it would go away.  It slowly resolved through out the day and was mostly gone by Saturday 1/16/21.  The only thing left was a faded red area about the size of a nickel.  Friday evening ,1/15, I started to not feel well with body aches, joint pain, headache, and pain from injection site that radiated to my chest (this was intermittent).  I also had a low grade fever (highest temp 99.9).  I still did not feel well on Sunday but some symptoms were improved (pain radiating to chest was better and no more fever) but still had fatigue and body aches.  I had a rapid COVID test done which was negative on the evening of 1/17/21.  On 1/18 I felt better but towards the end of the day started to feel fatigued with body aches and headache.  I contacted employee health for further follow-up.

                                                I had received the 1st dose of the vaccine on 12/22/2020. I tested positive for COVID 12/27/2020 and experienced mild symptoms such as mild fatigue and congestion. Thinking I had recovered from COVID I returned back to work as a RN on 1/9/2021.  I was told I could still get the 2nd dose of the vaccine if I still wanted to and that I should expect side effects of possible fevers, chills, fatigue and that they can last up to 3 days. I went ahead and got my 2nd dose on 1/13/2021. By the next day I had chills and extreme fatigue. I was expecting it and thought it would go away by the next two days. By day 4 I was feeling just as bad and actually felt worse than I did when first testing positive for COVID. On 1/17/2021 I experienced shortness of breath and palpitations while getting dressed. I went to ED and was sent home. On 1/19/2021 I experienced similar symptoms while driving home from DR appointment. Went to ER again and was sent home and was told it was all post covid symptoms.

                                                lost consciousness; Severe cramping; diarrhea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient). A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number: EL3249, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 13Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic fatigue syndrome from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12), Iron, and Vitamin D (VITAMIN D NOS); patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 14Jan2021 04:00 AM, the patient experienced severe cramping, followed by episode of diarrhea. During the cramping, she lost consciousness for an unknown amount of time. No therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events. Outcome of the events at the time of last observation was recovering. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of lost consciousness cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 37-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot # EJ1685) at single dose at left arm on 02Jan2021 11:45 for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient has received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 03Jan2021 the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with rapid nasal swab test resulted positive. It was unknown if treatment was received. The outcome of events was unknown. Later the patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot # EL0140) at single dose at left arm on 23Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at Pharmacy or drug store. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in 2 weeks of this vaccination included: Lamictal, Klonopin, multivitamins, D, C, B, Zinc. On 24Jan2021 12:00 AM the patient experienced extreme tiredness, chills, fever, muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, pale skin, malaise, night sweats. No treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag. Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use. Further information like confirmative COVID 19 nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment.

                                                This is a 37 y.o. woman who developed an episode of acute self-limited hemolysis just over a week following her second injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5&#39;s and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.  As this occurred just over a week following her second vaccination I cannot exclude that is could be related to the vaccine.

My flu-like symptoms resolved within 48 hours yet my breathing difficulties continued and worsened. I was treated in the Emergency Department on 1/12, 1/19 and 1/20 (work up negative for covid, pulmonary embolism, infection, cardiac abnormalities). It feels as though I am having intractable diaphragm spasms that are forcing my exhales out at the end of my breath cycle. I have lost 10lbs and have been essentially incapacitated for 6 weeks. I have been evaluated by head and neck (no vocal cord dysfunction), speech pathology (no swallowing difficulties), pulmonology (no lung specific issues) and am awaiting a neurology consult.

It progressively worsened and grew to up my side/chest to my armpit. It felt swollen and very sore and lasted about 48 hours. I googled the side effect and didn&#39;t seek medical attention.

                                                Immediately after vaccine felt flushed with high heart rate and lightheaded. An hour after, developed chronic mild headache, chronic mild lightheadedness, and chronic moderate fatigue which are expected symptoms with the immune response. HOWEVER, symptoms did not improve in 3 days and actually very slowly worsened until I couldn?t function for work about 2.5 weeks after the vaccine. At this point, the lightheadedness and fatigue were severe and headaches varied between moderate to severe, resulting in me being out of work for 9 consecutive  work days. Had multiple MD visits with tons of tests. During the time I was out, I developed severe lower abdominal pain for two days and severe lightheadedness/nausea/mild vomitting due to being nauseated with chronic headaches. OTC meds did not help much for the headaches nor other symptoms. I have never dealt with symptoms like these before and am very healthy.  At the 4.5 week mark post vaccine, these symptoms finally started to very slowly improve, VERY slowly. Tests at MD were inconclusive. I?m still dealing with chronic mild headaches, lightheadedness, and this past Friday now unusual chest pains that move location and severity.

I waited and it progressively got worse. it felt like I had phlegm stuck in my throat that I could not get out. nurses at the drive offered to call 911 but I was close enough to an Urgent care/ER that I decided to drive myself over there. they took me in, started an IV and gave me 50mg of epinephrine and Benadryl, steroids and Pepcid. they prescribed an EpiPen. They told me to continue taking Benadryl because the allergic reaction could resurface. cough is still present and I have body aches.

Next, I was feeling tingling in my extremities. Then like the flick of a switch, I went into anaphylactic shock. I couldn&#39;t breathe and struggled to get the words out to get an epi pen. I was then injected with 3 epi pens while the ambulance was called. I also felt tingling in my tongue and mouth. The following day at home, I had another reaction. It started with tingling in my throat then the shallow breathing again. Chest pains again, then anaphylactic shock again. The next day, allergy symptoms came back, but not anaphylactic shock. This time, the addition of burning in my biceps on both sides, which traveled down to my forearms. Later on, the burning traveled down my torso to my legs. There is also some burning in my ears and scalp. My breathing is shallow, and it seems like when the allergy meds start to wear off, the symptoms keep coming back.

A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered on arm left on 22Mar2021 14:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included low blood pressure. The patient had allergies with orphenadrine (K FLEX).  Concomitant medications included melatonin (MELATONIN) and paracetamol (TYLENOL) both taken from unknown dates and indications, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  On 22Mar2021 15:45 (when the patient was almost home), half of her lips started to go numb on right side. The next morning, the rest of right side of face had went numb. She went to urgent care after work and doctor told her that she had all signs of early stages of Bell&#39;s Palsy. Her blood pressure also went up to 153/103 (unit of measure not reported) on 23Mar2021. The patient required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care for both events. No treatment was also received for both events. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and no tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. Outcome of the events were not recovered.   Follow up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Palsy Bells cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I felt fine after the shot all day. I went to bed at 1030pm, woke up at 1130 hyperventilating (respiratory rate was 40&#43; and I couldn?t lower it),  shaking uncontrollably (felt increasingly cold, though my temp was normal; my skin was cold to the touch but I felt like it was burning off), tachycardic (heart rate was 140bpm and I normally am at 60-80 at rest). My throat felt like it was closing and my face was swollen. I should have gone to the ER, but I wasn?t thinking clearly and didn?t know what to do with my small children.  It took 2 hours until I stopped shaking, my heart rate returned to normal, and my breathing was under control.  Since then I have mainly been fatigued, taking Tylenol for overall aches, and have not been able to tolerate much activity (can only stand for about 5 minutes at a time).

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

Immediately after receiving the vaccine, patient developed lightheadedness, flushing, hives, wheezing and throat swelling.  Patient was treated in an emergency department with epinephrine, gradually improved and was able to be sent home with an EpiPen, prednisone, hydroxyzine, and famotidine.  The next day, patient again developed shortness of breath and her husband administered the EpiPen.  EMS arrived and gave another dose of IM epinephrine and IV diphenhydramine.  On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was altered, diaphoretic, tachypneic, tachycardic, and stridulous.  Patient was given multiple doses of IM epinephrine and started on epinephrine drip.  Stridor continued and was unresponsive to nebulized albuterol.  Patient was then intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.  Other treatments included solumedrol, pepcid, magnesium sulfate, nebulized epinephrine, and IV fluids.  admitted to the intensive care unit, weaned off epinephrine drip, and extubated the next day.

Experienced difficulty sleeping the rest of the night due to symptoms and restlessness. Following day, I continued to have fever averaging 100 degrees F, body aches, chills and headache that brought me to tears. That evening, began experiencing severe nausea and involuntary shaking. Reported to ER for management of symptoms. Received fluids, ibuprofen, Zofran and Reglan as well as potassium. It is currently the following Monday so 5 days post vaccine and I continue to have intermittent nausea and headache.

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart began to race and I became very warm and sweaty. I was brought into another room for monitoring and my heart rate was above 100. After some breathing exercises, it came back down to the high 70s for a few minutes but then increased again into the 90s, at one point it was 113. My chest and throat then began to feel tight and I began sweating again. My face also felt funny on my right cheek. At that point I was first given 25 mg of benedryl then epinephrine. I was then taken to the emergency room via ambulance and was observed for approximately an hour. I was given an additional 25 mg of benedryl and discharged at 4:55pm. I was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and prescribed 25 mg of benedryl every 6 hours over the next 24 hours. The following morning, I experienced a hot flash with profuse sweating followed by chills. I was very tired and felt feverish throughout the day on 1/12 and stayed home from work. On 1/13 I still felt tired but was able to work. Today I feel mostly normal but still occasionally have had heart palpitations.

A 38-year-old female patient received the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at 38-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood clotting disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: my heart rate, I was like in AFib (medically significant) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, very high fever of 103 (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, dizzy, light headed (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, arms sore (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, exhausted like an extreme fatigue (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered, palpitations (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered.  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;the day after the shot I got a very high fever of 103. I was dizzy, lightheaded. My heart rate I was like in AFib, it was going from 60s to 50s all over the place. And this was the next day after the vaccination. That evening nothing my arms was just sore. But the next day all of these side effects just started in and even still today I just feel so exhausted like an extreme fatigue and I am still getting like palpitations.&#34; The patient stated, &#34;So I went to urgent care and they check my vitals and stuff and when they wanted me to send me to the hospital. But I told them I will get a ride and I go by myself just because I didn&#39;t want, capable of an ambulance ride and I ended up just going home because I couldn&#39;t get a hold up anybody. So, I came home and took my blood thinner medication because I do have blood clotting disorder.&#34;  In regard to the outcomes of the events, the patient stated, &#34;I am not experiencing all of them still definitely my heart is much better. I am still getting palpitations but nothing near how it was that first day. I am experiencing extreme fatigue.&#34;

                                                I started feeling lightheaded, heart started beating fast, and I briefly felt like I might pass out. I raised my hand to tell the nurse, and she asked if I wanted to see the EMTs which I replied yes. I was able to walk to the EMTs with no issue, as the lightheadedness had subsided (felt lightheaded for maybe 1-2 min total time). The EMTs took my blood pressure and it was 160/100, with a high heartrate (they didn&#39;t tell me what that was). They gave me some water and I sat for a few minutes, starting to relax and feel better shortly thereafter. They took my blood pressure again, and it was down to 140/84 and they mentioned that the heartrate had gone down significantly as well. At that time I felt fine, and they felt I was ok to go home.

                                                The day following the 2nd vaccination dose, I had zero symptoms other than a slightly sore injection site.  Around hour 30 following the vaccination I began to feel warm, and I got up to brush my teeth and cool off in the bathroom.  As I was brushing my teeth, I started experiencing an increasing ringing noise in both my ears that I thought was strange and somewhat alarming, but I didn&#39;t feel any signs of dizziness or dysphoria.  The next thing I remember is waking up the bathroom floor with my husband standing over me.  Apparently I experienced a complete lose of consciousness and feel to the floor, hitting my chin on the bathroom vanity as I feel and splitting my chin open, which I have zero recollection of.  My husband states that when he found me, that my eyes were open, but I was staring blankly at him with a glazed over look and my whole body was limp and diaphoretic.  I came too in about 30 seconds after he found me, but I was very confused, not making a lot of sense, and felt very disoriented and weak.  It took about 20 mins for my fever to break, and to have the strength and power to get up and walk to bed.  We changed all my clothes because I had soaked through them, and he got me into bed after cleaning/bandaging up my chin.  I then slept solidly until noon the next day, which is very unlike me, but since then I have felt relatively fine with no other experiences of fever/chills/disorientation, just some continued mild fatigue off and on.  After discussing with my nursing colleagues, they all had similar experiences around hour 24-30 post 2nd vaccine with fevers, chills, restless sleep, or just general malaise, but no one experienced a complete loose of consciousness, so I reached out to my PCP yesterday, and she confirmed today that I should report this to VAERS.  I have never experienced any form of loss of consciousness/fainting/black-out/syncope prior to this, which is another reason I thought it was important for me to report this.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID).

A 38-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 20Dec2020, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine last 20Dec2020. On her first shot, she did good the first couple of days but had a sore arm in Dec2020. However, on 24Dec2020 while at work, her heart started beating really bad/heart beating fast and she had tachycardia/palpitations for 45 mins. She then mentioned she was a nurse and that the doctor hooked her up to a monitor and her heart rate was in 130s - it was sinus tachycardia on 24Dec2020. She informed that she had filed a report with the CDC. She went to the emergency room and her heart rate was 100-150 on 24Dec2020. She got fluids and her labs looked good, labs were normal on 24Dec2020. The only thing on 24Dec2020 was her TSH was high/ slightly elevated but her T4 was normal. Then she took it easy the next day. On Saturday, 26Dec2020 she began experiencing chills and took Tylenol and; her heart started beating fast again. She went to the emergency room and they repeated the labs, and everything was normal on 26Dec2020. Her TSH was higher than before on 26Dec2020. She went to see her doctor and the doctor thought that it was from her drinking a lot of caffeine before the vaccine and then her body building up antibodies days later. She was going off on tangent and unable to clarify details. She wanted to know if there was any data between the vaccine and the thyroid. Her doctor &#34;feels like safe&#34; and she had sinus tachycardia. She was asking if there were any reports on elevated TSH and tachycardia as a vaccine side effect. She further informed that she was trying to decide whether to take her second shot or not. She wanted to know if it was safe to take her second shot. Her doctor said it would be fine, but she wanted to know what Pfizer has to say. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 10 mins after receiving the first dose of Pfizer vaccine - I experienced chest pounding tachycardia. They had me lay on the gurney and checked my pulse ox. My heart rate was 147 but my Sp02 100%.  After about 30 mins or so it naturally came down with no medical interventions.  Otherwise for the first dose my only other reaction was expected fatigue, injection site soreness and mild headache.   Of note - I did go ahead and get my second COVID19 vaccine after consulting with medical professionals on 1/24 and did not experience any chest pounding tachycardia. Maybe mild tachycardia but I was also nervous due to the previous first inject reaction.

A 39 years old female patient (no pregnant) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899), intramuscular on 16Dec2020 10:15 at the first single dose at right arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.  Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3 1000).  The patient experienced rught MCA stroke on 25Dec2020 06:15. Seriousness criteria reported as hospitalization, life threatening. The patient was hospitalized for rught MCA stroke for 3 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 25Dec2020.  The patient received unspecified treatment  for rught MCA stroke. The outcome of event was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The subject had medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.  The reported stroke was more likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 38-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at 10:30 (at the age of 38 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 21Jan2021, the patient experienced chest pain and numb hands. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of chest pain and numb hands was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                I developed tachycardia at rest exactly 2 weeks after having the second dose of Pfizer vaccine. My heart rate while resting was 100-115 and increased to 130s-140s with standing or walking. I went to the emergency department at hospital. They observed that my heart rate was in the 135-140 range sitting in triage. I received some fluids and was discharged after it was determined there was no clear life threatening reason for the tachycardia, but my heart rate remained unusually elevated - sometimes up to 115 while siting and rising to 120s-130s with any physical activity for about a week after this event. It seems to be gradually improving at this time, but workup is still in progress.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

She received second dose 1/13/2021 at 0813 and had no side effects. Around 1500, she developed chest pain and wheezing. She used her albuterol inhaler (pt has asthma), which helped. That night, she developed a sore arm.  She woke 1/14/2021 around 0100-0200 from pain and was unable to go to back to sleep. She had aching in her left arm, as well as shooting pains through her arm and into palm. She took APAP 1000 mg PO x 1 and doxylamine which helped, but she was still unable to go back to sleep d/t pain. The pain expanded into her chest (especially with deep breaths), and upper back. She developed headache, sore throat, sweats and chills, shooting pain in her ear, painful and swollen left axillary lymph node, and the right side of her tongue became numb (numbness subsided after 1-2 hours). 1/14/21 morning, pt has persistent left hand pain, as well as joint pain in her feet, hips, and knees. She took another 1000 mg of APAP, which helped her pain. by 1/14 evening, she took 1000 mg APAP again and was able to sleep, although pt still endorsed sweats/chills.  1/15: Pt reports her pain is better, less severe, though now she is very fatigued and feels like she has been &#34;hit by a truck&#34;. Her left axillary lymph node is still painful and swollen, but less painful than before.

Pharmacist was called over and patient had her head between her knees while sitting in the waiting area.  She said she felt very dizzy but sitting forward wasn&#39;t helping.  Then about 30 seconds later patient stated she was going to pass out and wanted to lay on the floor.  While getting up she fell down and passed out, hitting her head on the cement floor.  911 called.  Patient came to about a minute later and stated she was going to throw up.  She spit a bit but didn&#39;t vomit.  She turned very pale and then turned bright yellow.  She was in and out a consciousness for a few minutes until paramedics arrived.  They examined her and took her to the er to verify if she had a concussion and make sure she was okay.

This was confirmed many times by EKGs and lasted 4.5 hours with HR ranging from 8-173 at rest. I was given a medication, Diltiazem 30 mg tab, and my heart rate regulated. Many tests were completed at ER and so far, no known cause for this event has been determined based on test findings. So symptoms lasted from 5pm to 9:45pm. Given medication which resolved the Afib. Stayed at ER running tests until 3:30am.

Then, per patient: &#34;Almost 2 weeks to the day after getting my first shot, on Friday 2/26, I suddenly and unexpectedly went into Rapid Ventricular Response atrial fibrillation. I was admitted to the ER department at Northwestern. I was there 10 hours and multiple tests were completed. At this time, no causes have been found that would have contributed to my going into RVR A-fib.  I am wearing a heart monitor for 2 weeks and will undergo a stress echo exam on my heart.  I do not have a cardiac history.&#34;

Her body was no longer expelling lochia/blood after the fourth weeks postpartum, however, the day after the vaccine, she began bleeding heavily. This continued on for four days. Her midwife said that ovulation and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. She didn&#39;t attribute to the vaccine until researching on a postpartum message board on What to Expect that there were other anecdotal claims of similar experiences. She would love to speak with someone about what this side effect could possibly mean for her future reproductive health and that if her newborn son.No treatment given; patient was recovering from bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021331585 baby case

                                                runs of Brady; B/P shooting through the roof.; Tachycardia; shortness of breath; wheezing; extreme weakness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 38-year-old non-pregnant female patient reported for herself that she received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EP6955) via an unspecified route in the left arm on 29Mar2021 at 17:30 (at the age of 38-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia. Allergies to medications, food, or other products included cefazolin (ANCEF), penicillin, and bandage tape. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included pregabalin (LYRICA) for fibromyalgia and BalanceMD (candida supplement). On 31Mar2021 at 09:00, the patient experienced runs of brady and tachycardia, shortness of breath, wheezing, extreme weakness, and blood pressure (B/P) shooting through the roof. These events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care via squad hospital transport and were reported as non-serious. There was no treatment received for runs of brady and tachycardia, shortness of breath, wheezing, extreme weakness, and blood pressure (B/P) shooting through the roof. The clinical outcomes of runs of brady and tachycardia, shortness of breath, wheezing, extreme weakness, and blood pressure (B/P) shooting through the roof was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

I sat down and had a few sips of water.  Within a few minutes, I felt like I was having a difficult time getting a good breath in.   I raised my hands over my head and took slow deep breaths to try and keep my breathing  under control.  I stayed at the hospital for about 45 minutes, over which time I had a few bites to eat and some water.   The flushing and sweating resolved within that time.  The lightheadedness and &#34;feeling of doom&#34; lasted about 3 hours.  I had no anxiety going into this vaccine, nor have I had a reaction like this before.

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 24Dec2020 at 08:00 AM in the hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, has no known allergies, had no other medications in two weeks, and did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. At 3:00 PM of 24Dec2020, the patient developed a severe tachycardia with no other symptoms. She walked herself to the ER (Emergency room/department or urgent care), was nervous and kind of shaking. By the time they got to her, her heart rate was stable and was at 88. Transient tachycardia was at around 120-140 for 7 minutes and resolved with no intervention. Basic labs came back normal. She got discharged from the ER. The patient didn&#39;t think they reported it but she was willing to cooperate in any way. The patient was not treated for the adverse events. As per the patient, she reported her adverse reaction (after the 1st dose) on the website as recommended. She experienced &#34;very fast heart beat 8 hours after receiving the vaccine&#34;. The patient was inquiring if she would be contacted after. The patient also asked if the very fast heartbeat was related to the vaccine because the reaction did not happen right away like usual, she was not sure if it was an allergic reaction since it happened 8 hours later. Outcome of the event &#39;Tachycardia&#39; was recovered in Dec2020, while for the other events was unknown. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

The heart rate spiked to 183 during a strength training workout and to 148 during a low impact weight training, which is unusual for the patient (as reported). The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of heart rate spiked and difficult to catch breath was recovered in Dec2020. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

That lasted through 1/8. On 1/7 I started having trouble with taking a deep breath. Chest would get very tight and hurt when I would take a big breath, bend forward, or lay back.  I went to express care and they could not rule out pericarditis. Told me to go to the Emergency Room for further work up to rule out spontaneous PE or pericarditis.

                                                After taking the vaccine, the next day, I cut my finger while making a salad and I bleed for a long time.  It was like 3 1/2 hrs my finger bleed.  It seemed unusual but nothing I couldn&#39;t handle or out of control.  I just wish they had informed me so I would have taken extra care when handling the knife.  I&#39;m not sure if this was related to the vaccine but I had never bleed that long before so I wanted to report it as a potential side effect.  I still think benefits of vaccine outweigh risk involved with vaccine so I am glad to have had the shot.

                                                Within minutes of getting the vaccine I had a brief(maybe 30 seconds) episode of dizziness. I didn&#39;t have any other symptoms during my 15 min observation period, but when I got to my car to leave the hospital, I had another episode of dizziness that lasted a couple minutes and then stopped. I didn&#39;t have any other incidents of dizziness, but started feeling fatigued and had chills that afternoon. Tuesday evening I had a slight fever, diarrhea, tachycardia, and palpitations. Over night I developed body aches.  Most of the symptoms were pretty much gone within 24 hrs, but the fatigue and tachycardia lasted into Friday. My heart rate was consistently 115-125 bpm from Tuesday evening through Friday.

Following second shot, also had axillary lymph node discomfort, transient on/off headache, lightheadedness, chills, fatigue. My submandibular lymph node has not resolved but HR issue has (why reported as ?no? below).

Patient was found to have low blood pressure of 86/58. A code blue was called by COVID clinic staff. Upon rechecking vitals,  the patient&#39;s blood pressure had improved to 136/79 and her oxygen saturation on room air was 100%. The patient was advised to go to the emergency department for continued monitoring but refused.

                                                I had very slight nausea soon after the first shot, then started having chills and whole body ache from the night (12/18/2020) for 24 hours followed by spontaneous internal hemorrhage (lower GI, significant blood in stool) in the morning  and in the afternoon of 12/20/2020.  The hemorrhage lasted for about 24 hours.  It started slowing down on 12/21/2020, then stopped.    I was evaluated by Dr., (GI) who was not sure if the bleeding was vaccine induced vs. coincidence on 12/23/2021.  Since the bleeding stopped, she cleared me for the 2nd vaccine and advised me for close monitoring for any other episode of bleeding.  I had some fatigue for about 4-5 days since the first shot, then I felt normalized.    Soon after the 2nd vaccine (in about 5-10mins) on 1/8/2021, I started having some discomfort/pain in lower rib region where spleen is.  Initially I felt like some chest pain, but it was more near spleen region, I think... I also had slight intermittent dizziness for about 2 hours after the 2nd injection.  The discomfort in left lower chest/rib improved and resolved in an hour or so.    Then, similar pattern started including chills and whole body ache on the night of 1/8/2021 followed by internal hemorrhage again (significant blood in stool) in the morning and in the afternoon of 1/9/2021.  The bleeding slowed down on 1/10/2021, then stopped.   I reported it to again my GI doctor on 1/11/2021 who ordered CBC to monitor my platelet level.  The result showed down trending from my baseline.    I think the COVID vaccine transiently affected me with internal hemorrhage and lowering platelets/likely potential thrombocytopenia given the clinical symptoms (spontaneous internal hemorrhage).   Platelet level is improving at this time and I feel normalized today.

This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

                                                After the first shot on 12/26/20 I had dizziness, facial flushing, elevated blood pressure, and tachycardia within minutes. It lasted about an hour. I had no issues after that. I received the 2nd shot on  1/15/21, I had the exact same reaction however it only lasted 20 min. I then went to my car and started driving home, about 10 minutes later and while on the freeway I had dizziness, flushing, tachycardia, , shakiness, and facial numbness. I took an exit and was able to pull over in a parking lot. It lasted about 20 minutes. Since that time I have had frequent episodes of dizziness, facial flushing, tremulousness,  facial numbness/tingling, and presyncope. The worst episodes were on 2/1/21 and 2/3/21. I was unable to work because of these symptoms.

                                                The patient was admitted to the hospital on February 10, 2021 for evaluation of jaundice.  This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Low risk esophageal varices. Labwork 15FEB2021- AST 173/ALT 64/Alk Phos 235/Plt 109/ Discharged on 02/15/2021 to home with plans for follow-up with GI and PCP.  Prescribed Prednisone with taper off after 28 days. Follow-up appointment has not yet occurred as of the day this report is submitted(2/19/2021).

Then on 2/14/2021 I started feeling burning  pain all over my neck and chest. It was slightly red that night. The next morning my chest, neck, and upper back had a red rash . My chest was the worst of it. Felt like a chemical burn . I went to the Doctor on 2/17/2021 and was told it was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine. I continued to take Benadryl, Zyrtec  and was given Kenalog. On Sunday 2/21/2021 the pain was so pain and the rash was only getting worse and now on my face so I went to urgent care. There I was given a steroid ( prednisone) , derma smoothe and Pepcid. It has been 10 days and no improvement yet.

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after injection my ears got hit and my face flushed. At about 25 minutes after injection I started to feel my heart race. Medical staff took my pulse and it was extremely high. My blood pressure even on all of my meds was 205/112. My resting pulse topped a little over 140 during monitoring. After about an hour my pulse was 110 and my BP was 190/95 and I went home to rest.  Called my physician a couple days after and alerted him. Monitored BP at home that day and it continued to go back to my normal. By that evening I was back to my baseline.  Other symptoms following day extremely painful arm cold sweats and feeling of unwell all which I know are common side effect. My pulse racing was extremely scary in that I have a hard time raising my pulse when I exercise due to my medication.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities.

                                                I immediately felt dizzy, like I was drunk. At around 4pm, I started feeling wheezy. It felt like there was a mastiff sitting on my chest. I took some benadryl, which helped. The next day, the feeling persisted and I had a mild cough, especially while lying down. More benadryl. Same on the third day. I did not seek medical attention because I didn&#39;t think it was an extraordinary reaction and I have had much worse reactions to other things in the past that have been managed with benadryl. I thought what I was experiencing was an expected side effect based on the information I had been given. The feeling started to ease by the 4th day, but then the insomnia, mood swings, exhaustion and body aches set in. The cough was sporadic, but still present. Today, I still get the heavy chest feeling intermittently, activity doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect or cause. My arm still itches at the injection site and hurts when touched.  I went back to get my second dose on 4/9. When the nurse asked me if I had had any adverse reactions to the first one, I told her about the chest heaviness and coughing and the other symptoms. She stopped what she was doing and called her medical director. They both decided that the first response was enough of an anaphylactic reaction to be a caution for the second. They refused to give me the second dose because they thought the second would elicit a much worse reaction - possibly to the point of intubation. They told me that I would have to be evaluated by a physician and that I would need a &#34;doctor&#39;s note&#34; in order to get the second vaccine.
