                                                On 12/24 at around 10 PM, circulation to my 4th left digit significantly decreased after being outside of my car for around 15 minutes during a temperature of about 50 degrees. I realized when sharp pain was felt at the digit. After about 5 minutes the digit felt numb. I got in my car, turned on the heater, and massaged my finger. Sharp pain was felt again as circulation returned to the digit. The event last approximately 10 minutes from the moment I realized the finger was pale until color returned.   This occurred again on 12/27 at around 2 PM as I walked from my car into a store at a temperature of about 40 degrees. This time, discoloration occurred bilaterally on my left 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits and my right 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits.  The event lasted more than 15 minutes with constant massaging.   This has occurred two more times since then, both times occurring bilaterally with minimal exposure to cold.

                                                24 hours after vaccine, I had typical mild cold/flu symptoms. After 48 hours I had a lot of pain in my injection arm and my armpit lymph nodes were swollen. I treated the pain with Advil and a heating pad. 72 hours after the vaccine I felt faint, dizzy, and nauseous. I began to vomit and have diarrhea that entire night and next morning. I felt very weak and was unable to keep any foods or liquids down. I was unable to walk around. I took Zofran 8mg which helped with the severe nausea and weakness.  These symptoms are ongoing.

                                                On 01/07/2021 I woke up  at 0300am with chills, headache, body aches, joint pain, fever of 101.2 and swollen left axillary lymph nodes. I took Tylenol and Benadryl and it relieved the fever/headache/body aches/joint pain, however the lymph nodes in my left axillary remained swollen. I continue to take Tylenol for the fever/body aches/pains without relief for the swollen and painful axillary lymph nodes. Warm  compresses do help to relieve the pain temporarily but they remain painfully swollen. On 01/08/21 I called my doctors office to ask if it was normal to experience such painfully swollen axillary lymph nodes to which they stated ?we don?t know, it is too soon for us to tell what?s normal and what isn?t normal right now.? They did not offer any suggestions to relieve the pain or swelling. The morning of 01/09/2021 , I called Employee Health at my hospital (my place of work and also where I received the vaccine) and they also stated they didn?t know if this was a normal reaction due to the newness of the vaccine. A couple hours later, employee health emailed me a link to the VAERS reporting website and asked me to file a report.

                                                Approximately 15 min after vaccination began to experience tingling sensation under tongue. It was not bothersome so I proceeded to go home. At 2:04 pm, approximately 40 minutes after vaccination was driving home and began to experience an elevated HR, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and throat tightness. Proceeded to pull over to a gas station and felt extremely weak when trying to walk and a tingling sensation all over.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl tablets and symptoms began to subside within about 10 minutes or so. Proceeded to continue driving home and had another episode at 2:49 pm, experienced significant shortness of breath and tingling sensation in mouth spread to back of tongue and it felt swollen. I bought liquid Benadryl instead and took ~20 mL. This episode resolved within 10-20 minutes as well and was okay for the rest of the evening.

                                                Had me wait for 15 minutes after vaccine and started having a redness in neck and was really itchy; whole body big time itchy. My chest - shortness of breath. Gave me a shot of benydryl  - 25 mg in my right arm and I went home and itching still didn&#39;t go away and I took pill of benydryl. Chills next day; super cold; headache; tired - and I couldn&#39;t think straight. Nothing was registering in my head with training at work - felt slow. Went home from took more benydryl. Next morning - pins and needles in back of my head. Went to urgent care (Riverside Urgent Care) and they gave me gave me Vexamethasone - shot it up in my butt and every symptom went away after that shot and I was okay after that.Itching went away after that. Felt weak for about a week afterwards. Went and had second shot yesterday 1/10/2021. They gave me medication with vaccine so I wouldn&#39;t get reaction this time. Gave me liquid 25 benydryl beforehand and had me wait 15 mintues and after 15 min they gave me the second dose of vaccine after the injection and they had me wait for 30 minutes. Right away I started getting itchy and they gave me pill form( 2 pills) of Vexamethsone and itching slowly stopped and they sent me home after an hour. Itching slowly went away - later that day. And today I&#39;m okay.

Did not say anything and sat there for the 15 minutes with continued shortness of breath and high rate think it was anxiety. When the time was up I continued to stay at the hospital for an hour due to fear of bad reaction. Started to become extremely nauseous within 30 minutes and loss of appetite. Went to bed and woke up with a terrible headache, body aches, extreme fatigue and a 100.3 degree fever. Slept for 8 hours during the day waking up due to the pain in my body and chills but the symptoms went away by 5 pm the following day of the shot.

This 26-year-old female patient (pregnant: no) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), intramuscular on 08Jan2021 at 07:45 AM at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety and depression. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (ZZZQUIL). No other-vaccine-in-four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), intramuscular on 22Dec2020 at 08:00 PM on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced tachycardia up to 150 resting, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, migraine, body aches, chills and fever up to 102. Symptom onset around 7PM on 08Jan2021 and stopped around 12PM 09Jan2021 except for headache which was still persisting as of 9PM 09Jan2021. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of headache was not recovered. The outcome of other events was recovered on 09Jan2021 at 12PM. The patient did not have COVID-prior-vaccination. The patient did not have COVID tested post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported tachycardia was probably related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At 1 AM on 1/19/21, I awoke with chills, a fever of 101, neck pain, muscle pain, joint pain, and a severe headache. This persisted throughout the night and I did not sleep. Took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen at 5:30 and slept until 7 AM. By 8 AM, my temperature was back down to 98 F. Took 500 mg of Acetaminophen at 10 AM with food. Headache, muscle pain, and joint pain persisted. Moderate to severe chest pain began 15 mins after eating at 4 PM. Waited 30 mins to see if it resolved; it did not. Went to the urgent care. Chest x-ray and EKG was performed, no issues found. Was diagnosed with costochondritis and was given a steroid shot and ibuprofen,  which reduced the pain significantly within 30 mins later.

Headache and body aches have worsened in severity. Unable to work for the morning but was able to go in the afternoon for a short time period. Lower body aches are particularly severe. Fatigue is noticeable. Mental health conditions have worsened but that may be due to lack of sleep.  30 hours following the vaccine: chills, nausea, and dizziness have dissipated completely. They were slowly improving throughout the day. Body aches and headache still severe but lessened with marijuana use.  48 hours following the vaccine: all symptom seemed to have subsided during the night. Sleep was much better quality.

For about 36 hours, it ran 100-130&#39;s; Dehydration; Feeling fatigued/Excessive fatigue; Had some general arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies. The patient started feeling fatigued about 1900 hours (07:00 PM) on 08Jan2021 and only had some general arm soreness. She woke up on 09Jan2021, with serious chills to the point of physical shaking; nausea started soon after and around 0300, began vomiting and dry heaving. The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

                                                Within 24 hours of getting my 2nd COVID vaccine, I began to feel weak and achy. My neck and face got really hot while the rest of my body stayed cold. A small headache began to turn into a migraine. During the night, my body began to hurt beyond achy causing me to toss and turn. When I woke up in the morning, I couldn&#39;t stand even the littlest of pressure placed on my body. For example, my cat jumped on my leg and it felt like someone wacked me with a baseball bat because of how sensitive my body was. The only treatment used for myself during this time was Tylenol. It helped with the head aches. Overall, it took me about three nights to actually feel ok again.

A 26-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number= ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: cephalosporins, coconut. Other medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Jan2021 at time of 05:00 AM, the patient experienced blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine and continuing into day 4 DOST vaccine, swollen lymph nodes under bilateral arms that had not decreased, chills and sweating, headache. No treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures post vaccination which included COVID nasal swab test and COVID PCR test, both were negative on 14Jan2021. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 14:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the workplace clinic. Relevant medical history included COVID-19, which was diagnosed prior to vaccination and migraines (before). The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included melatonin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Dec2020 at 15:45 or 1 hour after the vaccine injection, the patient had an aura like a bad migraine and she had bright spotty vision in the peripheral right field for 15-20 minutes; the patient has had migraines before, but they&#39;re not common for her. Two hours after the vaccine, on 30Dec2020 at 16:45, the patient had mental confusion and an inability to speak; she tried to say things to her husband and it was a jumbled, meaningless string of words. She also felt very cold and she had tingling around the mouth. Her husband thought she was having a stroke and called 911 on 30Dec2020. All her vitals were stable, and within 10 minutes she could speak again. On 30Dec2020, the patient&#39;s electrocardiogram (EKG) showed peaked T waves, common with dehydration and high potassium. She was encouraged to go to the emergency room (ER). Instead of taking the ambulance, she drove herself several hours later. The patient wanted someone to tell her it wasn&#39;t a stroke. After a brief neurological exam on 30Dec2020, the doctor said it was likely a severe migraine and wrote the reason for her visit as a vaccine reaction. This took place in the late evening to early morning, and she missed one day of work. The events did result in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient did not receive any treatment for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from all the events on 31Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event stroke with BNt162b2 can not be fully excluded.

                                                Cervical lymphadenopathy; Chills; Nausea; Feeling lightheaded; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 27-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231/4130421), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 10:00 in left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included linaclotide (LINZESS) and a combination birth control pill both received within 2 weeks of vaccination. On 29Dec2020 at 10:00 PM (22:00), the patient experienced chills, nausea, feeling lightheaded and cervical lymphadenopathy. The symptoms were severe enough that the patient needed to leave work in the middle of her shift (primarily due to the lightheadedness). The patient tried drinking juice, water, etc but it kept getting worse so after a few hours the patient decided she needed to leave work. The patient did not received treatment for the events. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering. The event was considered non serious as it did not results in death, was not life threatening, did not cause/prolonged hospitalization, was not disabling/Incapacitating and had no congenital anomaly/birth defect.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I began having chills and vomited. My fatigue became more severe as well. Later that evening my fatigue persisted and I noticed a rapid heart rate via my Watch. My resting heart rate which usually is about 80 BPM was at 100 while laying down and not engaged in any physical activity. When I stood I was dizzy and had poor balance. While my entire arm no longer hurt, the injection site showed a bump as well. When I awoke the next day my heart rate appeared normal again, and I wasn&#39;t especially fatigued compared to before I got the vaccine. I did experience another minor gastro-intestinal episode later that afternoon, but otherwise my symptoms appeared to have passed aside from the fatigue. By the end of my work day I was very tired again, although it is uncertain if this is due to the vaccine or from my continued recovery from Covid and adjusting to the physical demands of going back to my job in-person. Because I received my vaccine on the same day as my first day back to work, I have no experience working post-covid before having the vaccine to compare my current state of fatigue to. On the evening of 01/07 I noted that fatigue was slightly less pronounced. I do not currently have a primary care doctor but will be calling to try to gain an appointment so that my second dose can be monitored.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

                                                At 2am that next morning January 8th (almost 12 hours post vaccine) I woke up out of my sleep delirious, light headed, heart was racing, diarrhea, and felt like I was falling in and out of almost passing out, hot flashes, couldn&#39;t think straight. It wasa very scary experience for me. This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

I felt really dizzy and nauseated, I felt like I could not walk. I felt like I hit by a bus. The next day I had heavy flu symptoms, high fever, continuous chest pain and high HR, at the ER they gave me a high dose of Benadryl, steroids and fluids. I took Benadryl for about 7 days and I still felt light headed palpitations and fever for almost 2 weeks. I also was tested for COVID and it was negative. I was advised to not take the second vaccine. I still have a really bad fatigue. It is the symptom that is still on and off.

I got my vaccine at around 3, and didn&#39;t have any immediate reaction. I have an exercise bike at home, and tried to work out but had to stop after only half an hour of very low effort biking because I couldn&#39;t get a deep breathe. usually I can bike for an hour at high intensity no problem and have never had to stop because I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling achy and unwell. When I woke up in the morning I was extremely fatigued and my eyes were itchy and puffy.

                                                When I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID shot I had no issues. When I received the second dose I had the vaccine injected and then I got up and walked to the monitoring room where we sit for 15 minutes. Immediately upon sitting down in that room I felt very woozy, lightheaded, and my heart was beating out of my chest. I checked my pulse on my smart watch and it was in the 80s but my resting HR is normally in the 60s or 70s. I got nervous at that point so I took some deep breaths and tried to relax and my symptoms improved within a minute. I sat for the remainder of the monitoring period and right at my 15 minute mark all of my symptoms returned. HR in the 100s, lightheaded like I was going to pass out, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath. I alerted the nurse in the monitoring room and she took my BP and HR and they have me a bottle of water. My throat felt a little weird too and I was worried that it was starting to close up, but I was able to swallow  water normally. I remained in the monitoring room for about 15 more minutes and at that point my symptoms mostly resolved and I felt well enough to leave. For the next approx 48 hours I have had some mild- moderate chest heaviness. More worse in the initial 24-36 hours after the vaccination.

A 27-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Jan2021 at 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; received at a nursing home/senior living facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Medical history included COVID-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included unspecified birth control taken for an unspecified indication from an unknown date to an unknown date; within two weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: syncope episode in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, unconscious in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, fever and chills on 09Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, blood pressure was low, about 90/50  on 09Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, did not feel well in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown; all of which were assessed as medically significant. The clinical course was reported as follows: the fever and chills began about one hour after vaccination (as reported). About 18 hours after the vaccination, the patient was getting up to take more paracetamol (TYLENOL) and did not feel well. The patient had a syncope episode in the bathroom (no issues as she sat on the floor before hand). The patient was unconscious for about 1-2 minutes. The patient&#39;s blood pressure several minutes later was low, about 90/50; however, the patient took the blood pressure measurement herself, so it may not have been exactly accurate. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: low, about 90/50 on 09Jan2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of all reported serious events cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

No palpable lymph nodes on affected armpit. Mild discomfort with palpating the edema in the affected armpit. Took 600mg ibuprofen. Swelling continued into Monday 1/11/21, but had decreased in size

Swelling in lymph nodes of arm that received vaccine was so severe that I could not let my arm rest down by my side without throbbing pain. Pain went away after about 48-72 hours but swelling persisted for 1 week.

                                                I woke up at 4am to my heart racing. I am a nurse so I checked my pulse and it was 126. I tried to bear down at home to decrease my heart rate but it continued to climb to 164 so after an hour of sustained Hr 126-164 I went to the emergency room where I had SVT. They did a valsalva maneuver 3 times and that made my heart rate go down to the 130s. It was then sinus tachycardia and stayed 120s-130s until about noon. Upon discharge at 3:30pm my resting heart rate was still 105 but it was determined to be a vaccine reaction as all other tests were normal.

                                                within minutes after my shot, I started to have difficulty swallowing. i was monitored for 30 minutes at the vaccine site before being escorted to the medical observation area. While in the medical observation area I tried to take a sip of water but could not swallow it. At that moment I began having a tight feeling in my chest. I began to hyperventilate followed by difficulty breathing or talking. This was accompanied by feelings of impending doom, and uncontrollable trembling and inability to concentrate on what the medical observation area Doctor was saying. The time from the drink of water until I was able to breathe, speak, and concentrate normally was about 20 minutes. Tightness in my chest has improved but not fully recovered. General malaise and headache have developed.

                                                I am 29 weeks pregnant with my first pregnancy and due April 22, 2021.   I woke up and felt a tender lump on the right side of my torso. It is 4 inches down from my ribs. It feels soft and hurts to touch.   I contacted my doctor and they said that if it continues to get worse then to come in and get it checked out but as of now - just wait and hopefully it will go down.

We were able to delay delivery for about 24 hours but she did deliver at 25 weeks 0 days.  Earlier in her pregnancy she had some vaginal spotting (last time was on 1/15/21 and her cervix was closed on sonogram).  In her first trimester she had significant hyperemesis treated with medication and IV fluids but this resolved after the first trimester.

Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

                                                had a 102 degree fever for about 15 hours which started the evening of 1/5/21, which also included chills and muscle aches. The muscle aches lasted about 24 hours. The injection site was my left arm and I now have swelling in my left axilla which started the evening of 1/6/21 and is still currently swollen. I am an ultrasound technologist and was able to scan myself this morning when I came back to work. It appears I have a cluster of reactive lymph nodes in the area of swelling within my left axilla, the largest measuring 3.0 cm. It is very tender in the area of swelling and the pain radiates down my left arm. I had a lot of pain at the injection site that lasted for about 24 hours, it is now subsiding. However, for the last 24 hours it has been very painful to bend my arm. Any time I tried to bend my arm it sent a throbbing pain down to my left hand, it is still occurring today.

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1685), intramuscularly in the left arm on 17Dec2020 at 11:00 (at the age of 28-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included famotidine and fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), both for unknown indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took and had an allergy to amoxicillin. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 23Dec2020 at 13:00, the patient developed pain in her left axilla (6 days after vaccination). The patient was able to palpate a swollen lymph node in her left axilla. It continued to become more painful requiring ibuprofen and hot compresses. By 31Dec2020, her symptoms had largely resolved. She saw her physician who also felt the lymphadenopathy and had no other explanation than possible vaccine side effect. The clinical outcome of pain in her left axilla, swollen lymph node in her left axilla/lymphadenopathy, able to palpate a swollen lymph node in her left axilla was recovered on 31Dec2020. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                About 27 hours after my vaccine (at about 9 pm on 01/12) I began having 8-10/10 chest pain. Mostly burning sharp pain, but some restricting tight pain as well, radiating to my back mostly. It would be relieved for maybe 10 minutes at a time but then flare back up for about 5 hours. I went to the emergency room, where they did a cardiac work up including blood work and EKG, vitals and a chest X-ray, all which were unremarkable. At about 0200 am on 01/13, the pain subsided. Previous to the chest pain, during the morning and afternoon of 01/12, I had a low grade fever (99.9 F), an intense headache, and fatigue. 01/14/21 sore swollen lymph node under L arm.

Took Benadryl 50mg before bedtime.  2 days after vaccine: woke up with voice changes, coughing/choking with speaking. Used epipen once, felt full relief for about 1-2 hours. Trouble speaking again. Then went to ER, had epipen again twice, over two hours, Benadryl 50IV and Pepcid and steroids. Sitting in the ER now debating admission. Likely being admitted., home epipen are too expensive to treat q2h by myself.

                                                I got the COVID Pfizer vaccine and experienced warmth in my chest with the first vaccine. It went away after one day and was tolerable. I also developed a lump under my right armpit with the first dose that slowly went away. It was painful, but the pain was tolerable. With the second vaccine, I also got the chest warmth and chest pressure for 2 days. I did not seek help as it was also tolerable. I also developed the lump under my armpit with the 2nd dose, this time I still have it and it is more painful and bigger. I have been taking naproxen for the pain.

                                                I was awoken from sleep with violent chills and an sensation of severe cold. My chills became violent and coarse rigors, severe enough to contract the spine into hyperextension if I kept my body in a neutral position. I could still activate each muscle group to keep in a fetal prostration pose. I was knowledgeable of the event, did not loose any bowel, bladder, or smooth muscle function, and the intensity of the rigors was focused on the most developed skeletal muscles (thighs, calves, upper arms, forearms, paraspinal muscles, hands, respectively).  Jaw and muscles of the head/face seemed unaffected. Fingers and toes not distinctly affected. I was not sweating at this time and there were NO other symptoms to report; I remained lucid and able to self-reflect the entire time. Home temperature is kept to consistent 66F, no malfunctions to thermostat. No recent changes to bedding (sheet and quit on top of mattress); it is even optimized for me as I tend to overheat as I sleep.   At 50 minutes, I felt &#34;less frozen&#34; and confident enough to stand/ambulate for 220mg naproxen &#43; 500mg APAP , cautiously and successfully swallowed. Robe was donned over existing pajamas and thick comforter was pulled from hallway closet. Rigors continued, but it appeared that intentional activation of the muscle groups could still overpower the rigors for safe (but shaky) ambulation. Greatest risk was coarsely shaking hands a bringing cup to mouth to swallow pills.   Above activity was completed in 5 minutes. I then sat upright in bed under layers above. I could feel the muscles calm and relax, with episode completely ending in 5 minutes. Total time of event: 60 minutes.   Post-event details: There was a mild sensation of muscle tension in the posterior cervical spine akin to whiplash, but no residual symptoms. I debriefed with my husband shortly thereafter (he has been in another room the whole time) and fell asleep by 23:30. Awoke to alarm at 05:00 and able to stretch, accomplish 30 min run, vacuum/mop the floors, and present to work by 08:00am without deficit.  Time of documentation: 11:22 am 1/15/2021

She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose.  Around 08:40 AM,  she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat).  Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable.  She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination.  This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.   Of note, patient had experienced a similar reaction following her first vaccination (E-number 261589)

Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering.

Silicone in breast implant spread into her neck where patient was having difficulty breathing; Right breast implant exploded and spread to her neck where she was having difficulty breathing/Right breast implant erupted. Silicone in breast implant spread into her neck where patient was having difficulty breathing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician.  A 28-year-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# unknown), intramuscular on 13Jan2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. Vaccine location was right arm. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Patient called stating she wasn&#39;t feeling well. She was in the resident lounge and all of a sudden, the right breast implant just popped. Silicone in her breast implant spread into her neck where patient was having difficulty breathing on 14Jan2021. The patient was hospitalized on 14Jan2021, with pain medication and will have to have the implants removed. They think it is vaccine related. Patient was waiting for general surgery. The outcome of right breast implant exploded was unknown. The outcome of difficulty breathing was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported breast implant rupture and associated difficulty breathing were more likely due to breast implant surgery and the quality of implant, and unlikely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the seizure and other reported events due to temporal relationship.   Of note, the patient has a medical history of seizure disorder.  There is limited information provided in this report.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

The patient had no medical history/concurrent conditions and no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) (received within 2 weeks of vaccination). The patient had an adverse event (AE) left supraclavicular lymph adenopathy on 23Dec2020 which resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment for the AE included antibiotics.

                                                Next morning, I woke up with severe positional headache (headache with standing or sitting up, resolved completely with ibuprofen and tylenol within 20 minutes). The next morning I also had a sore left deltoid, and soreness extending into my left chest and shoulder, which diminished throughout the day after ibuprofen and tylenol. I also had a left swollen armpit, which I interpreted as swollen lymph nodes. My left armpit was sore and was visibly swollen compared to the right. The left lymph node is still visibly swollen as I report this (approximatley 36 hours after vaccine administration), and is sore but less sore than initially.   Of note, when I received the first vaccine in this series, my left deltoid was more sore than with the second administration, but soreness was limited to the deltoid and resolved within 3 days.

Became slightly short of breath and felt my heart was racing. Took 25 mg of oral Benadryl and told to go to ED.  In ED heart rate was 126 bpm and BP WAS 136/99. Monitored in the ED for a few hours with no  further interventions. Heart rate improved to 102 bpm and blood pressure to 129/82.

                                                1/8/21 - 15 minutes after second dose of COVID19 vaccine I had flushing (warm rash like) all over my chest and neck that lasted for about an hour. No itching or hives. 1/9/21 at 3am my heart rate started to increase to about 110bpm while sleeping and continued till 4am. 1/9/21 at 4am my apple watch alerted me to my heart rate was above 120bpm while resting. This is when I realized I was sweating and felt like I had a fever.  I drank water and went back to sleep. 1/9/21 5am heart rate was at 135. then 6am 148bpm. 7am around 161bpm. Kept trying to go back to sleep. 1/9/21 8am got up and took an adult benadryl tablet and drank plenty of water. Tried to relax to lower my heart rate.  1/9/21 9am took another adult benadryl tablet and was able to get my heart rate just below 120 while sitting. Then ate breakfast and went back to bed. If heart rate was not going to lower, I was planning on going to the ER. 1/9/21 10am till next day. Heart rate was then under 100bpm. I was then so tired that I slept all day and did not eat anything else.  1/10 I experienced severe body aches, chills and headache. This was all day. 1/11 I woke up feeling mildly nauseous for about 3 hours and then dizzy for about an hour. after that I just had a sore arm. 1/12 Had a mildly sore arm.

Woke up at 2:00am uncontrollably shaking with chills/goosebumps, sweating with shortness of breath. Extreme headache and all over body soreness also at that time.  This continued in waves for the next several hours. I finally slept for a short time and woke with continued headache and muscle/joint soreness.

The day after that was slightly better and the subsequent day I felt relatively back to normal.  I checked for fever many times throughout the symptoms but was always afebrile.

But at night I started wheezing, had sweats and chills, did not check my temperature but I had pretty severe chills that night. In the morning I checked no fever, but still chills, severe cough and sore throat.. Headache and fatigue.  All got worse more severe on Saturday and then I decided to go get tested for Covid on the Care Clinic. I had a known exposure to COVID before I got the vaccine around  01/04/21 - my husband who tested positive on the 6th) I tested positive. All symptoms continued (except the tingling on the mouth it stopped on the 8th) and I saw my OB-GYN on the 11th due to a low amniotic fluid - I had an ultrasound at the facility and was referred to MD and saw him on the 11th as well.  Now I lost my sense of taste and smell. The chills have subsided a little bit and so the headache, but fatigue, congestion and cough are still there. I had increased intermittent shortness of breathe but could be the baby&#39;s position.

Arm soreness was quite severe on 1/8, as it was painful to even lift the left arm for much of the day.  I also noted, about 5 hours after vaccination, that my jaw felt slightly tense, bilaterally.  On Friday, 1/8, I also experienced headache for the entire day, and I was fatigued for much of the day.   I noted clavicular lymph nodes as well.  About 18-20 hours after vaccination, I developed soreness in my back, and about 24 hours after vaccination, I noted some myalgia in the left leg.  These symptoms were responsive to acetaminophen.  The headache, clavicular lymph nodes, arm soreness, and myalgias were resolved by the time I woke up on 1/9.  Finally, I noted development of an axillary lymph node during the evening of 1/8, about 28 hours after vaccination.  This axillary node persisted until Monday, 1/11.

I could not sleep that night after I received my vaccine. I decided not to go the ER and slept it off I woke up much better next morning. I saw a Doctor a couple of days later because I had shortness of breathing and a high heart rate while I was at work. He just told me to take it slowly at work. No meds.  I then started working part-time for some weeks and am being introduced again now to my regular scheduled.

Didn&#39;t realize it was a fever until 5am when  woke up more, temperature taken at that time was 100.6. Fever stayed all day until 2000, no less than 99.0 even with Tylenol and ibuprofen until that time. Also developed body/muscle aches around 1200 on 07Jan2021, and some nausea. Got sent home from work that day. On 08Jan21 patient synced my (brand withheld) and checked my heart rate for day before. Didn&#39;t know it till then, but had heart rate of greater than 100BPM all day on 07Jan2021. Highest it got was 130, my resting heart rate is usually in the 60s. Also on 08Jan2021 no more fever, but whole right arm is in pain and have a swollen lymph node around right clavicle area. Pain with minor touch to clavicle and upper arm (at site of injection). Will be going to visit a doctor to make sure it is just a swollen lymph node since it is now 09Jan08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still swollen and there&#39;s still a lot of pain to R arm. Outcome of event fever was recovered, of others was not recovered.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm on unspecified date at a single dose (2nd dose) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Physician stated, &#34;she had no medical conditions, she was in very good you know very like standing with herself.&#34; Patient had her 1st dose of Covid vaccine on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Physician (reporter) stated, &#34;I am the parent of someone who got the COVID dose, the second dose yesterday. I am very concerned because my daughter yesterday (08Jan2021) started to have symptoms and fainted at 4:00 in the morning and hit her nose and has a scar now. She had her second dose yesterday (pending clarification), after the second dose last night she started to feel unwell, getting chills, nausea and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted, she blacked out. She lives alone, she is an adult, she hit her nose, got the scar in the nose, and the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop, she was bleeding from that scar. She told me it took two hours for bleeding to stop from that scar.&#34; When asked when the events started, Physician stated, &#34;Last night (08Jan2021), at 4:00 am she took the shot during the day while she was at work. She said, she started to getting chills and then she was nauseated.&#34; When asked if patient was still experiencing the event, the parent reported no as patient was just resting. Also stated, &#34;She didn&#39;t take any treatment but she said she took Tylenol.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;I am concerned, we are going to be taking her to the urgent care now but I am concerned about what is going on with platelets and all of that because of what had happened, last night the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop for two hours and she was alone at the night and weekends. She said, she had to lay down and then her dad is there now because he is closer, he is going to be taking care of the urgent care but I want Pfizer to know what my daughter has gone through last night after she took this second dose.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;she is having a rash in her arm, she had little red in her bumps as well. I want her to go get checked up as soon as possible in urgent care.&#34; Patient was taking some Ibuprofen (later clarified that patient took Tylenol as treatment). She was not taking any other medication. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                First Dose-  I had a headache after the shot and tremors started that even and throughout the night. No fevor. Arm very sore, going into neck.   Second Dose-  Felt find the night. Woke up that morning at 1am and with tremors and in a night sweat. Checked temp and it was only 96, but felt hot and was sweating. Woke up the next morning and my entire body, muscles and joints ached. My knuckles, ached, kept getting sharp pains in my knuckles. My jaw ached, difficulty eating. My entire body, my muscle ached, difficulty moving. I didn&#39;t get a headache till that evening. I also had severe heart burn that night, not sure if it was related, but I have never had heart burn that bad. The next morning when I woke up (5am) (now two days after my shot), again my joints hurts, I couldn&#39;t even stand.  Its like my knees couldn&#39;t even support me and I had a massive headache.  I went back to bed and woke around 9am, no longer had a headache, muscles still hurt. Around 11am, all of a sudden, muscles and joints felt fine.   The only thing (day three) is my arm pit on my left side where i got the shot is bothering my extremely bad.  I was able to put an ultrasound probe on my axilla area, and I have swollen lymph nodes in my axilla in the area that is very painful. I also have a dull pain in my elbow.

Suddenly, I passed out and hit my head and upper neck on the tile floor.  My parents heard the sound of my fall and luckily rushed to the bathroom.  They found me lying  unconscious on the floor with my eyes rolled up for what felt like more than a minute.  I regained consciousness on my own, and I drank water with a bit of sugar and salt mixed in.    I felt too weak to get up and walk, and the back of my head and upper neck were in pain.  I told my parents to call 911 as I wanted to make sure that there was no serious damage to my brain or neck area.  I went to the local hospital in an ambulance.  I was taken to the emergency room: Vitals were done and my temperature ranged from then was 99.5-101F and my heart rate was high- it stayed around 112 bpm for some time I was given 2 L of IV Saline Fluids EKG result: no clinical abnormalities CT head/neck/spine: negative 2 different types of COVID-19 tests: results were both negative Bloodwork: CBC/BMP/D-dimer: no clinical abnormalities Chest Xray: negative 2D- doppler ultrasound: negative Holter monitor: negative for irregular heart rhythm I was discharged the same day around 4:30pm

The first dose of bnt162b2 was taken on 17Dec2020. The patient&#39;s medical history included bipolar disorder. Concomitant medications included quetiapine (QUETIAPINE). The patient experienced some kind of back pain, behind her heart, heart pain and pretty strong chest pain on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered. In addition experienced &#34;fatigue caused by the vaccine was so profound that was advised to not take her bipolar medication, quetiapine&#34; on an unspecified date with outcome of recovered. It was reported that &#34;It took 36 hours for the extreme fatigue to stop. This was very frightening because being without the medication could cause auditory hallucinations to return after 36 hours. There should be a warning for people who must take sedative medication regularly so that they can make an informed decision about whether or not to receive the vaccine&#34;.

Feber has subsided.  Cough, shortness of breath and intermittent wheezing remain as well as some chest pressure, sore throat, headache and chills. Coughing fits are bad enough to cause urinary incontinence but I did give birth 4 months ago so this may not be significant. No signs of allergic reactive such as redness, urticaria or swelling.

Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

This A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EH9899), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included reaction to pork, porsine and/or if she ever was exposed to exposed to heparin. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced syncope (medically significant), dizziness (medically significant), feeling faint; like going to pass out now and then (medically significant), overall achiness, severe headaches, fever. The outcome of the events syncope, dizziness, feeling faint; like going to pass out now was recovering and outcome of overall achiness, severe headaches, fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The patient ask: are there any animal products, pork gelatin or a lipid form of that contain in the vaccine?   The events were described as follows: She experienced a significant amount of syncope and dizziness, for greater than 4 or 5 days post-receiving the vaccination. Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus. No further details provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events syncope and dizziness are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

                                                Within seconds of vaccine administration, I felt flushing of my upper and lower extremities as well as muffling in my right ear. My hands and feet became clammy. A small fan helped subside symptoms momentarily. Within minutes my lower extremities became shaky. I developed chills and felt faint. VS were measured. I was hypertensive (BP 134/100, baseline BP usually runs 110/80s). I developed intermittent tachycardic and heart palpitations, with a max HR of 124. Symptoms lasted approximately 1hour post vaccine administration.  I work at a COVID testing site, chances of me being exposed to COVID-19 are high. I was not tested prior to receiving either dose of the vaccine; however, I have remained asymptomatic for the duration of the series.

A currently 31-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 30-years, on an unspecified date at a single dose as COVID-19 vaccine. Medical history/concurrent conditions included positive ANA; ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); known allergies to sulfa drugs and mangoes. Concomitant medications included methylprednisolone (MEDROL), ibuprofen, and baclofen (received other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination). She was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was vaccinated in a hospital (facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered). She did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced sleep paralysis 2 days after vaccine associated with tachycardia on unspecified dates. The events were non-serious which did not result in death, not life threatening, did not caused/prolonged hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, did not cause congenital anomaly/birth defect. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and did not have Covid tested post vaccination (had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination). Treatment was not received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                I developed mild injection site pain about 5 minutes after the second dose which didn?t happen the first time so quickly. It shortly progressed to a cold/numb sensation from my deltoid down to my finger tips. This persisted but seemed to transition from more numbness to moderate pain from my left scapula, neck and down to my fingers about 7 hours after the vaccine. I also developed intermittent fasiculations of my forearm muscles on the left arm. This morning I woke up with worsening pain, mild numbness but new weakness in the hand and arm. I have a weak grip and can?t fully grab objects. My wrist flexión and extension are also weak as well as shoulder abduction (I am a neurologist by the way so can?t localize it to any nerve distribution). I?m not weak anywhere else and I only have mild arthralgia and diarrhea systemically.

                                                At 4:10 I awoke with pruritus and when i looked at my arms and I developed hives on my bilateral  forearms and bilateral hip area.  I felt itchy all over.  When I stood up, I felt palpitations and started to feel as if I was going to pass out.  I sat down and I started to tremor and felt like it was hard to catch my breath.  I took an antihistamine and took a puff of albuterol.  I felt a lot better. At 10 AM in the morning, the hives have improved but i still feel some pruritus.

Patient walked out of the vaccination room after her 15 minutes observation period and did not complain of any symptoms. She walked to the main entrance and notified a clinic manager at the check-in desk that she was experiencing &#34;chest pain.&#34; Clinic RNs came to observe and assess the patient. The patient communicated with no displays of distress. When asked what type of chest pain, she stated &#34;heaviness pressing on her chest, localized on the left side and on the upper chest area.&#34; Patient denied pain radiating down arm and denied jaw pain. Patient denied SOB and had no signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. She was escorted to the ED via wheelchair at 18:33. The ED note states that symptoms were most likely related to anxiety (patient mentioned she was anxious about receiving her second dose) and as patient reported symptoms completely resolved, she was discharged home from the ED at 19:01.

Around 2:30am felt pressure and warmth (coming in waves) up towards my chest, lasting 1-2 seconds and occurring about every 5 minutes . Was able to withstand feeling until it became difficult to breath. Lips and face turned white and blue, fainted. Felt extremely nausea when awake.  Called 911. Vitals were normal apart from BP was very high 130/100&#39;s. EKG was NSR. Blood sugar taken was normal around 113. After 1 hour of event, I took a shower and drank water. I felt the wave one more time before trying to fall asleep. Then stopped. Woke up fine.

Each episode lasts 30-40 mins then subsides and symptoms go away completely. I had 3 episodes of these symptoms the first day and so far 3 the second day. My doctor recommended I go to the emergency room.  Based off my EKG, vitals, and family history there was no reason to believe that the episodes were causing any heart abnormalities.

This physician reported that a 30-year-old female patient (daughter) received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced blacked out, fainted, felt very unwell, nauseous, chills, fell, knocked out, hit her nose, started to bleed, humongous scar on her nose, in her hand there&#39;s a rash with different dots/red, she has petechiae/rash on the forearm, all on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The Caller wanted information on side effects specifically looking at platelet or clotting or bleeding issues. Her daughter, (female, age 29 date of birth) received the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine, received it at the (State name), last night. She felt very unwell, nauseous, chills, and then blacked out, fell, knocked out, hit her nose, started to bleed; fainted and hit her face, didn&#39;t stop bleeding for 2 hours. There&#39;s a humongous scar on her nose. It took 2 hours to stop bleeding. She&#39;s going to urgent care today. Her daughter was healthy, yesterday was 2nd dose. In her hand, there&#39;s a rash with different dots/red. She has petechiae/rash on the forearm. Thankfully it (bleeding) did stop. The outcome of events for &#39;knocked out, hit her nose, started to bleed&#39; was resolved on an unspecified date, for other events was unknown. The case was reported as non-serious.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based solely on a chronological association a causal relationship between events blacked out  and fainted and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reevaluated should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I tried to wait it out for a  couple of hours and nothing improved so I went to the ER 12/31/20 and they did EKG and other tests. They medicated me with Ibuprofen and sent me home. The next day I had to go again because the pains were worse. At the ER at 01/01/2021 they redid the same tests and all came back normal. I still feel the chest pains not as strong they come and go. I had them yesterday but not today. My PCP does not know what to do and prescribed me XANAX to keep me from getting stressed and making it to come back. My employer suggested doing a COVID test but I had not had a chance to go and have it done yet.

She was initially very ill and was thought to have sepsis due to fever/initial presentation/clinical picture, also had lab abnormalities including thrombocytopenia.  These things necessitated transfer.  While at hospital, hematology was consulted.  Decision was made to transfer due to concern for DIC/possibility of leukemia. Also there was concern for C Diff, treatment was given for this.  While in hospital, she underwent further testing on blood samples which revealed no evidence for malignancy, also bone marrow biopsy was performed.  While there, DIC labs were trended/began to improve.  Discharged on 1/5/21.  Had f/u with hematology @ hospital on 1/12/21.  No reason has been found as of yet as to why she became ill.  Per discharge note it&#39;s thought it could have been viral in nature, or possibly related to supplement use.  Will f/u with heme in early Feb.   Of note, she does report getting her first dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 12/17/20, she reports concern that this could have played a part in her illness.  She states this was the only new/out of the ordinary thing that she can remember recently, regarding her medical hx, prior to recent acute illness/hospitalization. Requests I reach out to inquire how she can file a report with Pfizer or CDC

                                                syncopal episode; itching; fullness; feeling funny; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 30-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198), intramuscular on 19Feb2021 14:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included manual vacuum aspiration (MVA), traumatic brain injury (TBI) from 2007 to an unknown date, vagovasal and hypotension post TBI, Celiac disease, allergy to milk products, diagnosed with COVID-19 from Aug2020 to an unknown date prior to vaccination. It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication included famotidine, methylphenidate, fludrocortisone, omeprazole, desvenlafaxine succinate (PRISTIQ), brexpiprazole (REXULTI), and folic acid. The patient was previously vaccinated with the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL3246) at the age of 30-year-old, intramuscularly for COVID-19 immunisation on 19Jan2021 at 14:15 and experienced heart flutters and &#34;fell faint&#34; (fainted). The patient also previously took ibuprofen and experienced allergies. After approximately 5 minutes after the patient had the second dose of vaccine (19Feb2021 14:20), the patient had syncopal episode, itching/ fullness. Covering physician present and assessed with EMS on Duty: VS: 110/80-BP, 18-RR, 96-HR, SaO2-98% on RA, CBG: 138. Patient awakened and reported &#34;feeling funny&#34; on 19Feb2021, but was A &amp;Ox4, MAEW x4 with equal strength, Lungs Clear to auscultation. At 14:20 the patient was given Benadryl liquid PO given along with 8oz of water. Patient able to drink without issues. At 15:00, EMS called for ER transport to due prolonged recovery. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient had a syncopal event preceded by nausea and lightheadedness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her.

Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient.

Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

Also painful and tender right axillary lymphadenopathy. Symptoms began the morning following the second vaccination in the series and have so far lasted for the full day.

It would come about a min. or two apart. Lasted for 30-45 min. Resolved on it&#39;s own. They transported me to ER. They listened to lungs; did not hear wheezing. My blood pressure was elevated a little initially - 130/90 which is elevated for me. And then it went back down within that 45 time frame. I was monitored there in ER. They wanted to monitor me in the ER so logistical reasons. Did not have rash or light headness. Released after an hour of observation and symptoms had resolved. Then went back to work. The place of vaccination and ER were the same hospital.

Medical history included factor II, history of melanoma. She has no known allergies. She was not pregnant at the time of the vaccination. Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), ibuprofen (MOTRIN), multivitamin. Nurse reported administering COVID-19 vaccine at hospital,  experiencing tachycardia, high blood pressure, redness on chest, chest tightness, lightheaded, possible tongue swelling (felt heavy after vaccine), arrhythmia, dry mouth, sore throat (after leaving emergency department) at 14:30 on 20Dec2020; After one day, she experienced diarrhea, headache, lower back pain and fatigue since 21Dec2020. Fatigue lasting for several days. Adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care (pending clarification). Nurse received intravenous diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and fluids as treatments. Nurse assessed the events as non-serious. Nurse also reported that, prior to vaccination, she was not diagnosed with COVID-19; since the vaccination, she has not been tested for COVID-19. She did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Outcome of fatigue was not recovered, outcome of the rest of the events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the tachycardia, high blood pressure, arrhythmia and the other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG at baseline and during subject drug therapy, echocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, chemistry panel and serum toxicology screen, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

My body began to feel tingly all over even my tongue but it never swelled.  I was given 25mg of benedryl and monitored for 30 minutes and finally my body began to normalize and my BP went down to 130/70.  I went back to work but when I got home I took more benedryl because my body still had the same tingly feeling.  After about 24 hours all symptoms had subsided.

My HR went up to the 160s, my BP was elevated to like 166/80.  I was given 25mg benedryl, which calmed the flushed feeling and I was monitored for about 30 minutes and finally my BP and went back down to around 130/70 and my body normalized out besides the tingling which lasted the remainder of the day.  I had a little nausea.  I went back to work and finished out the day.  I took more benedryl when I got home to help with the tingling feeling which finally deminished after about 24 hrs.

                                                Developed a &#34;scratchy throat approximately 20 minutes post vaccination. Symptoms worsened and she developed shortness of breath. Required evaluation and treatment in the Emergency Department. Received Benadryl, dexamethaxone, famotidine and solumedrol. Second COVID vaccine, no reaction with the first vaccine. ED provider notes below: This patient presented due to concern for allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine and was seen by myself immediately upon arrival.  When in triage the triage nurse noted her oxygen saturation was 81% so she was placed on 2 L nasal cannula and brought directly back to her room.  When placed in the room she was hooked up to the monitor and her oxygen saturation was 100% and I took her off of the nasal cannula and her oxygen saturation remained in the upper 90s.  She had no stridor and respirations were nonlabored.  She was speaking without difficulty and had no vocal changes.  She did not appear to be in any acute distress.  Her posterior oropharynx was widely patent and she had no uvula or tongue swelling or lip swelling.  She did have some blotchiness to the upper chest area but no hives.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  Pulse was regular.  Blood pressure was stable.  She was nontoxic in appearance.  An IV was established and the patient was given Decadron and Benadryl for initial treatment.

                                                Noticed burning in left forearm immediately after vaccine, within 1 min. Symptoms progressed to feeling hot, flushed, and tachycardia briefly around 5 min. 10 min developed a pressure in my chest, and dizziness. Within 20 min, developed itching, flushing and hives specifically on left arm, hand, and across chest. Within 45 min, both ears and forehead covered with hives. Hospital staff made me go to ED. Within ED hives continued to progress across the chest and bilateral arms and wrists. Received 50mg of Benadryl, and 40mg of prednisone. Symptoms improved but did not resolved. 3 hrs following vaccine, bilateral lip swelling. Took 40mg of percribed pred and 25mg of Benadryl again around 4pm.  Within 12 hrs, significant diarrhea. Hives resurfaced on face, bilateral wrists, arms, and ears around 645 on the 12/29. Fever 100.3 noted on 12/29-12/30. Intermitted hives, and lip swelling remained until 1/1. Nausea diarrhea and body aches until 1/2.

                                                Right after the second dose less than 2 minutes my heart rate began to spike. I could feel my heart pumping fast. I couldn?t sit due to this so I began pacing the room. I didn?t know this was a side affect so I thought I was over thinking the second dose. I attributed this to all the worry and doubt the media and people around me try pumping in your head. I thought I was having a panic attack. I didn?t alert any of the medical team there because again, I thought I was over thinking it. A few hours later my heart rate had gone down. My Apple Watch helped me monitor this. The next day I felt pain at the injection site, not my normal self, groggy. Slightly feverish and chilled. I work in a cold environment so I couldn?t quite tell if the chilled feeling was a side effect, or the room. Later that evening around 9pm things took a turn. I began running a low grade fever and was shaking from being so cold. About another hour late my fever was up to 101 and I was still shaking from being so cold. I took about 600mg of ibuprofen. I couldn?t sleep, tossed and turned. Probably another hour later my temperature was 102, still shaking uncontrollably. Covered in about 5 blankets I kept waiting it out. And I?d say around 2-3am I could feel my fever breaking. By late morning my temp was back to normal but I felt achy still. Tired, sore. Definitely sore at my injection site. And I don?t know if this is worth mentioning or not but just haven?t been able to shake that panic attack feeling. Like a worry or a dread over me. I just don?t feel as clear-headed as I did before. This is my biggest concern. Just don?t feel myself yet.

Onset of severe chills/shaking, fluctuating temperature (no fever), horrible aches and pains, significant fatigue, and persistent headache from about 3am the morning after (on 1/8) and lasting until bedtime that day. The next morning (1/9),  most symptoms had resolved except for fatigue. I also experienced a new sx: severe pain and tightness in my chest/torso; was hard to breath normally and could not take a deep breath without experiencing significant pain. This lasted until about 3pm. Fatigue persisted the rest of the day. All symptoms had resolved by the next morning (1/10).

This was controlled 3 hours later by tylenol. For the next 36 hours post symptom onset my sinuses were still affected, my muscles felt very weak and the glands in my neck felt swollen. Everything has resolved except the swollen glands in my neck and my sinsuses being dry and painful.

She did not notify anyone, and after her 15 minute wait, she went home.  Her respiratory symptoms worsened despite taking a dose of diphenhydramine.  At the urging of her family, she went to the ER four hours later, where she was evaluated.  No treatment was done, and she was told that she was having a mild reaction.  Her symptoms resolved after several hours.

                                                On  12/25 I was driving home and my left arm got numb, tingly and weak to the the point where I thought I was suffering from a stroke.  I  rushed to my moms and had her to drive me to the hospital where they did a neuro check to include a CT scan which ruled out the stroke but the symptoms lasted about 4 days which came and went with the pain and intensity varying each time which ended around 12/29.  I suffered from body aches and night chills one night.  Around the 12/29 I began to have pressure around the back of my head which felt as if I was laying on bricks when I laid down.  It got to the point to where I couldnt sleep which caused me to go back to the ER on  1/1 where I was given  toradol, decadron and sudafed which allowed me to sleep. I was released from the ER with Motrin 800 and contined to take that and Tylenol until the headaches ceased  which was about 3 or 4 days later. The headache went away but the pressure still remained.  My lymph glands were swollen so I was also given a prescription for amoloxicillin.

Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

Associated with shooting sharp nerve pain radiating down the left arm in the medial nerve distribution, likely from nerve impingement.

                                                Head felt heavy/full/tingly starting about 6 pm on day of vaccination, fell asleep around 9:30 pm and woke up about 11 pm with left arm pain, very fatigued. Went back to sleep and woke up around 4 am with fever up to 100.6F, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, and extreme fatigue. My left axilla was swollen with arm pain to mid left chest and back, and my axillary lymph node was painful and swollen to about the size of a large grape. I took 440 mg of Aleve around 8:30 when the fever did not subside. The fever broke and did not return. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. My left axillary lymph node is still palpable as of today, 1/15.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiration date: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included testing positive for COVID in Apr2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took flu shot and experienced soreness. The patient did not receive any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient called in regards to Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She received her first vaccine last Thursday, 07Jan2021. She was not sure if she can report this as a side effect, but she had some rashes appear just today (11Jan2021), at midnight, in her neck and chest area. The rashes were going away, but she still has some itching. She also stated that she took some over-the-counter diphenhydramine (BENADRYL, UPC: 1254717031, lot number: PJF044, expiration date: Jun2021) tablets to relieve the symptoms. She explained that she started to experience soreness/ pain at the injection site a few hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The pain in her arm has already went away. She noticed a swollen lymph in her armpit area on Friday morning, 08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still a little bit swollen. She didn&#39;t expect on getting a rash since she read symptoms only appear around 2-3 days only. Therefore, she is not sure if she can report this as a side effect because its been like 3 days already. She noticed the rash just today, at midnight. She stated that she is still itchy. She stated that there is just a little bit of itchiness in her neck. She felt a little bit warm and itchy in her chest area, at midnight (unspecified date), and she kept scratching. She knows she shouldn&#39;t have done that but it was itchy. The patient would consider these events to be non-serious. She did have some soreness with a flu shot before so it&#39;s not too serious. She explained she is a healthcare worker. She works in a nursing home facility and they asked if she wanted to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and she filled out the form. She also explained that she doesn&#39;t have any allergies to any medications. So, with the rashes that came, she is not really sure what is the cause of it. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. She stated she wanted to report this information but she also needs advice on whether she needs to continue taking Benadryl. Her rash is improving, but she is still a little bit itchy. She doesn&#39;t have any shortness of breath or anything. It&#39;s not a major reaction, just a little bit of a rash/itchiness in her chest and neck area. The outcome of the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 10Jan2021, for lymphadenopathy and rash was recovering, for pruritus was not recovered and for feeling hot was unknown.

I?ve been taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours to combat high fever but it wasn?t going down. I had chills with the fever, so bad that my body was shaking. Fever stayed in the 101 range from Monday evening until Wednesday morning. Extreme shoulder pain radiating from left to right on Monday evening - lasted into the early morning on Tuesday. Chest tightness with R shoulder pain Tuesday afternoon from roughly 130p-315p. It subsided and so I did not seek medical attention. I?ve also had a severe migraine the entire time since getting my shot, but haven?t taken my Ubrelvy as I wasn?t sure how my body would react.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

A 31-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via Intramuscular on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was seen in the ED for petechiae and ecchymoses on 15Jan2021. She had not taken any recent medication or had any illness previous to this event. The only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series. Lab assessment showed platelet count decreased to 22,000 cells per cubic microliter (normal over 140,000). She had no other findings to describe cause of her decreased platelet count by lab or clinical exam. Provided a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia purpura, in the ED setting, she started pulse dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four consecutive days with a follow blood count showing resolution on day 4 of her treatment with a platelet count of 230,000 cells per cubic microliter. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received Steroids as treatment. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Recieved the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccination on Dec 26th 2020, and had no major adverse reaction to vaccine except for mild soreness and heat around injection site and intense fatigue for three days after. Symptoms went away after the 4th day. Two weeks later on Jan 5th 2021, i began to notice an intense itching, burning, and swelling at the injection site. Pain and soreness in arm made it difficult to do my job and seem to just get worse. Upon the next morning of Jan 6th 2021, pain remained but itching had gone down, but intense burning, soreness and massive redness around injection site remained and seemed to be getting worse. Pain remains and redness has not gone down, arm is very tender near site and lifting and moving arm is very stiff and sore. Feeling of lump or stiffness on injection site comes and goes and feeling of heavy and sore muscles move from upper left arm down to elbow and extend to hand; making movement and function slowed or slightly numb. Stiffness in arm and intense heat at injection site makes it uncomfortable to move or use arm. Cold tingling sensation on occasion and stiffness in elbow joint. Slight dizziness and fatigue follow with pain in arm. Was informed to see a physician on Jan 6th, 2021 who said to fill out vaccination adverse event report and to keep an eye on arm. If pain or symptoms become worse to return.

I felt shaky  and like I was going to pass out. Very nauseous.  My blood pressure was 169/93 @ 0830. The staff had me lay down.  About  5 min later I started to feel better.  Another 5 min later it happened again in a wave. The symptoms just came over me. My blood pressure @ 0840 was169/104. The staff had me drink water and rest. @0900 the wave came over me again. My BP was 178/111. I drank more water and rested. BP recheck @ 0925 162/112.  @940 BP was slowly coming down at 145/109. At that time they transferred me to the Emergency room.  My BP came back into normal ranges, and the waves stopped happening around 12pm. I was then released home with plans to follow up with Primary care on  1/11/2021

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

I then used my emergency inhaler for asthma and was able to breathe better. I went back inside clinic to be monitored by a doctor. The coughing continued and resided after about15 -30 minutes. My blood pressure was normal per the doctor and my breathing returned to normal per the doctor.

                                                I work as an occupational therapist in acute care. On 12/28, I was helping a patient transfer from supine to sit. She required maximal assistance, and I was briefly in an awkward position with my trunk flexed and rotated towards the right during this transfer. I felt a pull in my left lower back. After this, I iced the area and took 400 mg ibuprofen and this relieved the mild pain I had.  The following two days, I made an effort to follow back precautions (avoid bending, lifting, twisting), avoided heavy lifting at work. On 12/29 in the morning, I felt only a mild soreness in my left lower back and was able to go on my workday without issue (avoiding heavy lifting) On 12/29 around 3 pm I received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. On 12/30 (day off work) from the time I woke up until around early afternoon I felt a mild weakness and heaviness in both of my legs. It was most notable when I was standing to cook for about  20-30 minutes that my legs felt shaky and I felt the need to sit. I was able to finish cooking without sitting, however, this sensation was abnormal for me as I normally am on my feet for most of the day with an active job without feeling shaky or weak.  Around 22:00 on 12/30 I had severe nausea for about an hour or so. I can&#39;t fully remember, but several days after 12/28 or 12/29 I started to feel a mild cold sensation in my lower back. I attributed this potentially to my mild back injury, but it was unclear.  The sensory change was intermittent and mild, and ongoing until recently. On 1/9 while at work, I started to feel a mild cold sensation below my belly button, in addition to the intermittent lumbar back cold sensation area. On 1/11 at work, the sensory changes to my lower abdomen and back were more apparent after assisting in a maximal assist transfer with a patient.  At this time, it was a combination of cold and burning sensations.

Concomitant medication included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (OCELLA), clonazepam, amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]). On 02Jan2020, patient reported injection site tenderness for first 24 hours. In less than 24 hours she had developed tenderness under her left arm, into her armpit and it continued to spread downward and also toward her breast. Patient also developed swollen lymph glands in the same areas. No treatment received in response to the events. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient received her second dose of bnt162b2 on 08Jan2021 11:00 in the left arm. Outcome of the events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are possible; Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

Around 2230 that night, I started having intermitted sharp pain in my leg arm pit. 0430 January 20th I woke up with sharp pains still in my left arm pit. By 1030 the pain was now constant and extreme.  I called my doctor and he told me to come into the office to see him. NP saw me and explained that the lymph nodes in my left arm were swollen. Very tender to touch also. He prescribed me Prednisone twice a day for three days, Ibuprofen, and use hot compresses. So far the pain has gotten better.

She attributed this to excitement from completing vaccine series and finished her 15 minute wait time. She went home but it became harder to swallow and she felt like her chest was &#34;heavy&#34; and she became short of breathe walking up stairs. She took fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg and  filed a report with the CDC. Her symptoms resolved and she slept. The morning after her vaccine she felt fine and went for a 6 mile run. She called vaccine clinic to see what kind of follow up she needed to completed and was asked to contact PCP and employee health.  She presented to PCP that day (day after second vaccine) who reported ongoing symptoms of moderate chest tightness and some throat discomfort. Given prescription for Medrol dose pack, albuterol inhaler, and EpiPen and instructions on when to present for care.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient herself).  A 32-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# El1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 11:45 in right arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID from 15May2020 to an unknown end date. Known allergies was no. Other medications in two weeks included pantoprazole, cholecalciferol (VIT D3), ascorbic acid (VIT C), zinc, fish oil, curcuma longa (TURMERIC).

A 32-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unknown route, on 12Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Relevant medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), hypothyroidism and anxiety. Past drug history included allergy to cefprozil (CEFZIL). Relevant concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN XL), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). On 12Jan2021, the patient had tachycardia, facial flushing, fatigue, arm pain and swelling. The events required a physician office visit. Therapeutic measures taken as result of the events included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). On 14Jan2021, the patient underwent a COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) which resulted positive. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 12Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 14Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

A 32-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included idiopathic hypersomnia and allergies to eggplant. The patient has no covid prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), methenamine, levonorgestrel (MIRENA), propranolol hydrochloride (PROPRANOL) and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]).

The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely that the reported events were causally  related to   BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent  conditions.   A contributory role of the patient&#39;s Mirena IUD  should be  evaluated.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received the vaccine in the left arm on 12/23 with no immediate symptoms. On 12/24 I had body aches mostly on my left side. On 12/25, I started having a strong headache, focused mostly on the left side. On 12/26 the headache continued and I also noticed swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, and behind my ears. Also, it felt like someone had broken my nose and when I would try to bite down or chew I would have a sharp pain and pressure in my nose and sinuses. On 12/27, the headache continued, and I had severe left eye pain, as well as pain chewing and the swollen nodes, that became painful to touch. On 12/28, I went to my PCP and was tested for covid, which was negative. She diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed amoxicillin. On 12/29, I noticed my scalp had lumps on it that were painful and I had a very itchy spot on my forehead, which became swollen as well to about a quarter size lump. I also had other painful spots on my scalp all over and a continued severe headache and left eye pain. I tried to follow up with my PCP on 12/31, but their office was closed, and the on call nurse referred me to urgent care. More painful, swollen lymph nodes have appeared on my face and neck. I wasn&#39;t able to be seen at urgent care until today (1/1), and was then diagnosed with Shingles. I was told to continue amoxicillin and to start taking Valtrex. I am very itchy, mostly on my face, scalp, and left side of my body.

She did work on her feet but she wasn&#39;t working on her feet for that week, so she just didn&#39;t know what was causing the swelling and within the last couple of days in Dec2020 she had a quick heart rate like her pulse, it&#39;s not that high but for she it was high it was like 112, 115 as her resting heart rate, so it&#39;s just been having like heart palpitations kind of, she just wanted to report that and kind of see if other people were getting that as a symptom possibly from vaccine. She had in her past had sort of allergic reaction not to a vaccine but &#39;a bad reaction&#39;. She had swollen legs like edema, so she was just hoping. And then the patient stated that she wasn&#39;t tired at the starting, so she wasn&#39;t tired the same day&#39; (could not be clarified further). No treatment was received for all events.

It is still red to this day and it feels achy all the way to my wrist.

It was very mild and resolved within 1 day.  On 1/4/21, she noticed L axillary lymphadenopathy returned. On 1/5/21, it had spread to her right axillary lymph node.  It continued to worsen until Friday 1/8/21 when she reported to me and our physician to inquire about possible deferment of vaccination.  She still has swelling and tenderness at both axillary lymph nodes today 1/11/21. Severity is moderate in that it is painful, but not debilitating.

Which is still a little swollen but improving; pain at injection site/painfulness at the injection site; shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 33-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included immunosuppression. Concomitant medication included ongoing vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for immunosuppresion. The patient got a couple of the side effects listed. She developed painfulness at the injection site, and it was red a couple of days. She is wondering if she needs to be worried about getting the second one. It was pretty painful that night. It was pretty painful for the next day. If someone barely brushed up against it, it was very painful. Two days later, her husband noticed her shoulder was very red. And then she realized there was a defined red mark where the injections was. The pain is fine now. She didn&#39;t get a rash or have trouble breathing. She did have a swollen lymph node a couple of days later. Which is still a little swollen but improving. She does take an immunosuppressant. The outcome of the events pain at injection site and shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was recovered, while recovering for the event swollen lymph node a couple of days later was recovering.

She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

A 33-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (also reported as Pfizer brand, lot no: EK5730), intramuscular on 06Jan2021 at 06:30 at a single dose on the left arm (as reported, also reported as left deltoid) for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included anaphylaxis to &#34;unknown chemical substance&#34; while jogging in Oct2014 that resulted in a 4 hr hospitalization in an emergency department. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 16Dec2020 at 8:00 PM intramuscular on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported swollen lymph nodes upon palpation to left armpit with noted visible swelling to left armpit as well as pain to left armpit on 07Jan2021 at 6:30 AM. The symptoms were present 24 hours post vaccination intramuscular to the left deltoid (as reported). The patient did not receive any treatment for the reported adverse events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

On 06Jan2021 at 23:00, started at night of day one, the patient experienced severe headache. The patient experienced also heaviness in the head when she woke up next day (07Jan2021) and had some hot/spicy sensation around eyes area (07Jan2021). The patient needed to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) to get some relieve and she did not even have good appetite during lunch time on day 2 (07Jan2021). On unspecified date the patient had no fever and her body was cold; occasionally some nauseous sensation but didn&#39;t throw up. Eyes feel so tired and hard to concentrate. Hopefully those symptoms go away soon as days pass since it bothered patient sleep. The patient had a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient took also guaifenesin (MUCINEX). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                12/20: 10 mins after the injection my arm started hurting so I was moving it around and suddenly a felt a tickle in my throat, swallowed and felt like I swallowed the wrong way and was coughing to the point of feeling like I was going to vomit. Per everyone around I was bright red and I looked weird. The ER nurse said my heart rate was 125 and my systolic BP was elevated at 130s (normally in the 110s). After sitting for 45 mins heart rate was back to 60s. Still felt like I was in a fog but felt ok. Once I walked to my car I felt alot of nausea again and was on and off the rest of the day.  In the middle of the night I woke up short of breath laying on my back had to lay on my side.  12/21. I was moving pavers and got short of breath. Checked my heart rate and it was 100. O2 sat was 99%. If I sat and didn&#39;t move I was fine as soon as I started moving it started again. Also felt nauseating all day. I was having a hard time concentrating and my husband was getting frustrated that I wasn&#39;t understanding what he was saying. My left arm hurt really bad all day  12/22 By the afternoon felt more normal except my arm still hurting really bad.  12/26 was shoveling dirty and suddenly my arm where I got the injection started hurts and I got very nauseated again.  On 12/29 the cdc called me because I did the vsafe program. They were wondering if I was actually going to get the second vaccination because they said my reaction is a severe reaction.  12/30 my arm started itching had chills and temp right after  1/1 rapid test was negative for covid  1/2 pcr was negative

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

                                                At 8pm I felt tried and went to bed- starting at 9pm I began having shivers and could not get warm. My temperature  was 102, then  my fever rose to 104.5 for most of the night. I did not sleep because my body was shaking and shivering. My body ached all over, especially my lower back. It felt like a very bad flu. My fever continued onto the next day and stayed around 103.7. I slept most of the day- had to call out of work. Tuesday morning my fever was gone and I went to work then went home because my fever spiked again to 101 about mid day. I slept all day and took Tylenol. By Wednesday my Fever was gone but I was still very lethargic. Thursday I felt fine.

Patient had history of ongoing Autoimmune Thrombocytopenia from May2020, ongoing migraines, depression/anxiety and ADHD, and COVID-19 21Apr2020 to &#34;05May2021&#34;.  Concomitant medication included Sertraline Hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), Lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE), Lorazepam  (Ativan), Ondasetron (ZOFRAN) and Sumatriptan succinate (IMITREX).  Historical information regarding dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 17Dec2020 included a moderate injection site reaction lasting 6 days worst on day three. Reaction was characterized by redness, swelling elevated rash surrounding injection site, aching pain radiating from neck to fingers and tenderness to palpitation.  1st dose Vaccine Lot Number: EJ1685, Vaccine Lot Expire Date: Mar2021, Time the Vaccination Was given: 08:00.  After the 2nd dose the patient experienced a moderate headache on 08Jan2021 12:00 for 1 day which responded well to APAP- caffeine and resolved on 09Jan2021 12:00 Patient had a flare up of my autoimmune thrombocytopenia as evidenced by legs covered in petechiae and bruising on 09Jan2021. Emergency room and physician office were not visited however, patient does have standing CBC orders from hematologist, so she had platelet count checked. It had dropped to 109K/uL, which is low for me but not dangerous. Patient originally developed autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) May2021 after COVID Apr2021. Both instances of these side effects were manageable, but patient wanted to report them as there was no data yet available on ITP with the vaccine when she met with hematologist to discuss it. Patient received Acetaminophen 650mg PO (per oral) as treatment.  Lab data included Platelets 13Oct2020 124 kiU/L (normal 140-400) and on 12Jan2021 109 KiU/L.  Event flare up of my autoimmune thrombocytopenia resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00, Platelets dropped to 109k resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00, legs covered in petechiae and bruising resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00 and headache resolved 09Jan2021.

Around 4:30pm, I noticed minor unilateral scalp, facial and neck numbness on the left side. These symptoms lasted about a week, but slowly improved. Four days after the vaccine I had very tender lymph nodes on the left ear area. Today marks two weeks exactly since I received the vaccine and two days ago I noticed slight increase in numbness on the left cheek again which again, is slowly improving.  However, I also wear Invisalign at sometimes notice that I bite my cheek while asleep. I also wear N95 masks four days of the week which are quite tight on the face.   The injection site (Left deltoid) was moderately sore for the first few days and still two weeks later has minor soreness the comes and goes.

I started to feel flush and my heart rate rapidly increased. I felt it was nothing so i tried to calm myself and watch my heart rate on my watch and it continued to increase. It started at 100 and within a minute was at 130. I finally honked my horn for assistance and my symptoms continued. I became very faint and nauseous and felt as though i was going to throw up. open my door and took my mask off to help with getting air and it didn&#39;t do much to help. I felt very light headed and uncomfortably closet o passing out than i ever have. This lasted for a good 10 minutes until it slowly passed. Faint, nauseous, hot and rapid heart rate of 130 were my main symptoms and were very uncomfortable.

My injection site (Left deltoid) was swollen and sore, although not more than usual after receiving a vaccine. I had no headache at all. The major concern was the fever and the backaches. I could not get warm, and I was shaking badly because I was so cold. I had ZERO relief despite taking 700 Mg of Tylenol. Side effects finally subsided after about 5 hours.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction 6 days post vaccine 24Dec2020; I had severe chest tightness; SOB; throat soreness; hoarse voice; mouth swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient.  A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

                                                I have an infection at the injection site. I believe this could happen with any vaccine but wanted to report just in case. I am experiencing a large circle (a little smaller than a baseball) of swollen red skin that is painful around the injection site. Last night, the lymph nodes in my armpit, neck and collar bone on the right side swelled up and were painful. I feel fatigued.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 04Jan2021 08:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included overweight and elevated cholesterol. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient was not pregnant. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 04Jan2021 08:00, the patient felt a rush of dizziness to her head a few minutes after receiving the injection and then her heart started racing over 150 bpm. It calmed down after a few minutes although she have felt a little lightheaded all day. No treatment was received for the adverse event. The events were considered non-serious by the reporter.

Asked and received 25mg Benadryl with cup of water. -0742 started clearing throat frequently and slight cough. Knew it was anaphylaxis and told the team I need to go to the ER. Asked for additional 25mg Benadryl. Also took 20mg Famotidine and 2 puffs Albuterol inhaler--this is my prescribed anaphylaxis routine. Had Epipens on standby. -0743 put on O2 saturation monitor and watched O2 drop into 90-92 range. Asked for epipen on standby as I know when I need to start it.

Voice started becoming hoarse. -0800 EMS arrived (delay as team didn&#39;t know if they were supposed to call 911 or a Code--they chose EMS even though in hospital). Then staff at COVID vaccine clinic kept emphasizing need to go in ambulance while EMS and self fought to go through hospital (much quicker route). Finally cleared to go through hospital to ER. To get some air via breathing in had to sit up leaning forward. Voice completely hoarse by this time. -About 0817 arrived to ER bay. At this time, frequently coughing and cough started to sound stridorous. Difficulty getting breaths in. Had chest pain near heart. Greeted by MD, 2 RNS, and technician. -0819 received IM epinephrine.

Blood pressure was elevated &gt;180/90, HR 110-120.  Gradually decreased and at approximately 30minutes post injection, blood pressure was &lt;145/90 and HR 84.  Took 25mg of benadryl approximately 1 1/2 hour after injection time. Symptoms persisted mildly for another 30-45 minutes after benadryl and seem to be gone 5 hours later. Blood pressure 5 hours after was 134/85 which is still a slight elevation from my norm.

Later that morning 6:30am, I developed severe fatigue, dizziness upon standing and walking,  a L sided headache, L sided arm pain extending from elbow to sternocleidomastoid muscles on the L side, and axillary lymphadenopathy in the same arm as the vaccine (left). I took 650mg of Tylenol and went to work. Walking at a normal pace, my heart rate was 145. At rest inside the hospital it was in the 110s (measured by watch). the headache lasted all day on 1/9 and 1/10 and my neck felt slightly stiff (it was difficult to turn my head to look at traffic behind while driving). I took additional doses of Tylenol on 1/9 and 1/10 and by the AM of 1/11, all of my symptoms had resolved except for the L axillary lymphadenopathy.

She came back to the nurse that had administered her vaccine at 1:10pm where her oxygen level was monitored and she was given a cold cloth and water to drink. This lasted for about 20 minutes. Her oxygen level was monitored (~97%), her BP was checked at 1:45pm and it was 125/90. Her hotness, elevated HR, and shakes went away. At 2:00pm her BP was checked again and it was 139/96 and then again at 2:05pm where it was 132/90.   The patient stated that she felt fine and normal by now and also said that she had a BP cuff at work and at home and said that she would monitor it. All 3 of 3 follow up options discussed with patient: virtual care, the CDC, and/or 911 depending on her condition. The patient left at 2:15pm and patient was called 1 hour later for follow up.  On the follow-up call the patient stated that she was feeling fine and that her BP was 126/90. She said she would continue to monitor her BP and follow-up with virtual health if it wasn&#39;t back to normal by tomorrow.

                                                I started experiencing soreness to left arm about 1-2 hours after injection but nothing else. I went to bed around 11pm. Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

                                                Lightheaded; Tachycardia; Blotchy rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient herself). A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: Ek9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 08Jan2021 (at 11:00 PM as reported; pending clarification) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at the hospital. Relevant medical history included that the patient had known allergies to medications, food, or other products, but was not specified. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D), curcuma longa (TURMERIC) as supplement, and an unspecified multivitamin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 08Jan2021 (at 11:15 AM as reported; pending clarification), the patient experienced lightheaded, tachycardia, and blotchy rash, which resulted in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lightheaded, tachycardia, and blotchy rash, which included diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and steroid. The patient was recovering from all the events.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular on 05Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Mild ADHD/ADD. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccination, she was standing in the observation room (where they had all of them stay for at least 15 minutes to ensure no severe reactions) and experienced a sudden onset of vertigo, tunnel vision and pre-syncope. Her hands became cold and numb and she was trying to talk to another staff member who was arranging/scheduling her second vaccination dose at the same time when this event occurred, but it subsided quickly and she started to feel normal again. All these events occurred at 12:45 on 05Jan2021. She reported this event right away and they had her stay in the room longer. She was stable at that point but experienced these symptoms again but very mildly twice more while she walked back to her car to go home. Other side effects on 05Jan2021 that started in the evening and for the following 2-3 days included fatigue, sore arm, leg/thigh aching, sniffles/sore throat, brief dry cough and slight headache/neck ache. Very mild and tolerable symptoms. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and the patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of all events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine at approximately 9:15am on Thursday, January 14, 2021 in my right arm.  Almost immediately, I felt a pain go down to my wrist and across my chest. We pulled into the waiting area and around five minutes after the injection the right side of my face went numb., the pain had left my arm and chest by the time.  The nurse reacted by calling the emergency room and sending me there.

Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

                                                Starting the morning after my vaccine, at 0930, I had a headache and began to feel tired. I took tylenol and a nap. Around 1100-1130, I started to feel a little feverish, but did not have a fever. Around 1200, I began to have chills, my headache returned, and my fingers and toes felt frozen/numb. I took a very hot bath for approximately 45 minutes and subsequently laid in the bed (with intermittent napping) for 2 hours. Upon full wake up around 1430, I had no more chills, no headache, and felt back to my normal self.

Never lost consciousness and was able to able to breath through the event and drink water after a couple of minutes. Patient also felt rapidly hot and dizzy.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

A 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ3247), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Jan2021 at 15:20 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included gestational diabetes (first pregnancy) from an unknown date to an unknown date and two pregnancies on unknown dates. Concomitant medications included unspecified post-natal multivitamins and paracetamol (TYLENOL; Lot Number: SBA22; Expiration Date: Jan2023) taken before getting the vaccine on 23Jan2021 to prevent soreness. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 03Jan2021 (at the age of 34-years-old; Lot Number: EL0142) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination (except the first dose). On 24Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced chills and had a feeling like a heavy weight on her body. On 24Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient had a fever and headache. On 24Jan2021, she also had back pain. The clinical course was as follows: On 23Jan2021, the patient took paracetamol before getting the vaccine as she heard one can feel sore after getting it. The patient received the second dose on 23Jan2021 at 15:20. The patient was okay after she got the vaccine. However, early the next morning (24Jan2021), she had shivering without any fever (later referred to as chills). The chills were something she never experienced in her life. It was like she was in the cold. She could not move, it was that bad. She felt a heavy weight on her whole body. She could not get out of bed.  A few hours later at 07:00, she checked her temperature and it was 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She took paracetamol. The headache started with the fever around 07:00. She stated she kept taking paracetamol. She did try to stop using paracetamol, but without it, the headache was still there. The back pain was also severe on 25Jan2021. The chills recovered on 25Jan2021 and the fever was recovered on 26Jan2021. The clinical outcomes of the headache and felt like a heavy weight on the body were unknown; while that of the back pain was not recovered. The events of chills, fever, headache, and back pain were reported as serious by the patient (nurse) for being medically significant. The patient (nurse) assessed the events of chills, fever, headache, back pain, and felt like a heavy weight on her body were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known BNT162B2 vaccine safety profile causality between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

On Saturday (13Feb2021), she had shortness of breath and the urge to vomit (nausea), she was about to faint. She was also dizzy and checked her blood pressure, it was &#34;high&#34;, around 129/88, but she can&#39;t recall the values exactly. She doesn&#39;t know if she should get the second dose because she&#39;s scared. The patient wanted to know if these are symptoms from the vaccine or could it have been a reaction or allergy. She is scheduled for the second dose on 04Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I am an APRN, and received the vaccine not quite one week ago. I waited 15 minutes within the facility and then left. Sat in my car working for about 8-10 minutes when a sudden rush of heat ran through my body.  I felt lightheaded, my tongue was prickly, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I was able to get back into the facility to let them know of the sudden symptoms.  At that time I felt like my heart was racing and was diaphoretic. They continued to watch me for another 15-20 minutes, they did have an epi pen but it was not given. I was feeling slightly better and then left again.  I waited in my car approximately 20 minutes before deciding it would be safe to drive away.  After driving for about 10 minutes I had another rush of heat, lightheadedness, and then I started having shortness of breath.  At this time it would have been about 1 hour, maybe longer, since receiving the vaccine.  I was not close to an emergency medical facility at that time, and did not feel like my throat was swelling so thought it would be best to try to drive to the nearest ER.  I knew I had an epi pen from my work that I could use if needed.  I contacted another nurse practitioner who I work with who stayed on the phone with me until I was able to get to a safe place.  At that time the symptoms had improved, not resolved.  It had been able 20 minutes during this episode.  In all, I continued to feel jittery for about 3-4 more hours.  Since my symptoms did improve I did not go to the ER.  I contacted my health department, Louisville health dept, the following day and reported symptoms to the medical director.

Starting Tuesday morning, for three days, I got calf/feet cramps that were non-stop. I did call my doctor and got lab work done on 12-31. This lab work showed some kidney values that were off. Starting Sunday my legs and feet swelled up. I had a routine MS appointment on Monday and they stated since there is no data for folks with MS and the vaccine that they cannot rule out the vaccine is playing a role in some of this along with the IVIG.  I did follow up with my primary care doctor on Tuesday and they re did lab work as well as did a ultrasound to rule out blood clots. She did state she felt like it was the perfect storm between the COVID vaccine and then the Immunoglobins that I am on.  She suggested I download the app for CDC and report those items as well.  The doctors are still suggesting I get the 2nd shot just have to do some things prior to the second shot.

Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP and they said to call employee health.

The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

                                                swollen lymph node, right side of neck; caused pain when swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professoonal (patient). A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Dec2020 11:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic asthma and allergy to animal dander, mold, pollen. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel (NUVARING), salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR), and OTC vitamins. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took erythromycin and experienced drug allergy to erythromycin. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. 1 day after vaccination, on 30Dec2020 08:00, the patient woke up with swollen lymph node, right side of neck. Between 30Dec2020 and 04Jan2021, it increased in size and caused pain when swallowing. On 04Jan2021, the patient sought care at local emergency room (ER) due to concerns that it may be blocking esophagus. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram (CT scan) with unknown results on 04Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with intravenous antibiotic. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The events were considered non-serious by the reporter.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

After waiting in the monitoring area for 45 minutes I drank some water and felt like my bilateral upper thighs were difficult to lift when I tried to walk to my car. I went home and was tachycardic 120-130bpm that continued throughout the night to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep my heart was pounding so hard and fast. I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated all night.  I continued to have tachycardia for several days despite hydrating. My thighs also continued to feel week for several weeks. I developed a 100.7 F temperature and had flu like symptoms the following days.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

Aching has been ongoing and intermittent.  1/17/21 Developed left ear &#34;fullness&#34;.  On 1/20/21 went to GYN for exam, explained left underarm pain, told that my breast exam appeared normal, but she questioned if my left ear fullness and left under arm pain were related.  1/21/21 Left Ear &#34;fullness&#34; began to radiated causing left temporal pressure, spreading across forehead.  Pressure developed behind both eyes.  Sudden onset of dizziness occurred.  Went to urgent care where they said I had swollen lymph nodes and believed I was having a auto immune response to something.  Told I received the vaccine on 1/7/21, they said the symptoms could be related to the vaccine.  1/22/21 Notice I would occasionally feel like I had a &#34;lump or pressure&#34; to the side of my throat.   As of present I am continuing to have Left  Ear &#34;fullness&#34;, left underarm aching, and bilateral eye pressure has bee intermittent yet ongoing.

A 35-year-old female patient received second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021) intramuscularly on 12Jan2021 (between 8:30 to 9 am) at left deltoid for Covid-19 prevention. The first dose was received on Wednesday (unspecified date). Patient had no medical history and had no concomitant medications. At night of 12Jan2021, the patient had a fever of 102, but she went to bed with it and she woke up in the morning around 4:30 or 5 am (13Jan2021) in a pool of sweat, so she took her temperature and she was fever with 103.6. Patient took Motrin (Store Brand, lot number as either: 0GE2417A or OGE2417A, expiry: Apr2022) three 200 mg tablets, for a totally of 600 mg for the fever and had a cold shower, and the temperature came down to 103. Then after like 10-15 minutes of her laying on the couch with ice packs on her arms and stuff, it went down to 102.6. Patient was not going to go to the ER for just the fever, but then she started having heart palpitations, and she took her blood pressure and it was 170/113 and her heart rate was 176. Patient went to the hospital, and when they took her heart rate, it was 156. She had her blood taken at the hospital and everything was normal, except that her Potassium was a little low, it was 3. The ER did an EKG that showed Sinus Tachycardia and she was given IV Fluids (two boluses of 0.9% Normal Saline, 2000 mL total via IV, a bag of Potassium IV, two oral tablets of Potassium, unspecified total dose), and everything went back down. She had to call out from work that day and planed to follow up with her Primary Care Physician (PCP) in a couple of days. Patient was no longer had the fever, high blood pressure or high heart rate, as when she left the ER this morning, her temperature was 98, blood pressure was 111/82, and her heart rate was 96. She felt good now, but she did not know if it could happen again. Patient thought that it was maybe just her immune response to the vaccine, so she would say that she has recovered probably close to completely. Patient also had a headache and ringing in her ears, and those had resolved by now as well. The events Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure resolved on 13Jan2021 and other event resolved in Jan2021. The patient stated that the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) could have been serious with her blood pressure being so high, but it was not so serious because she did the right thing and went to the ER for treatment and got fluids. She believes the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) are medically significant. The patient believes that the events she experienced were directly caused by her receiving the vaccine, as she has never had these symptoms before other than she of course has had fevers in her life in the past.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This nurse reported for a 35-year-old female patient (Daughter) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 Vaccine lot number: EK9231, Expiry date: Apr2021) on 16Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported was She was positive, our whole family had COVID and we all came down which was about the same time which was 29Dec. Concomitant drug were not reported. Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am calling for my daughter. She received her 2nd vaccination yesterday morning and she had some side effects. Like about 6 o&#39;clock this morning she came in, she came in 6:35, she came and woke me up and said that she felt some of the reaction she is having. She has nausea, she has slight temperature 99.7, fatigue. Just a general feeling of aches and pains. It does not seem like it&#39;s an emergency. She was treated in the ER with steroids and since that point we have all recovered until she went for the 2nd. She works in a hospital, she got her 2nd dose of vaccine like I said yesterday morning. &#34;Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am not sure causality. I mean it is not an emergency. She was feeling fine yesterday. We all are feeling better now. She had the vaccine and last night she said she had a sore throat when I looked at her throat. Her throat seemed red but there was no angioedema or anything like that, she went to sleep and she came in &#39;feeling really&#39; (voice distortion) sick. So, I do not know. Did they have relapses from the COVID? I do not know.&#34; Treatment was &#34;Tylenol.&#34; Like I had said that she was feeling heavy with her chest. She went to the ER. She was at her work. She went to the ER.&#34; &#34;Probably close to 10 days ago, they did lab work I think they might have been looking for a clot. They did do some lab work at the hospital with unknown results.&#34; Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

This 35-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3249) intramuscular, in left arm, on 22Jan2021 at 08:00, for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine was given on the same day or in 4 weeks. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 vaccine on 04Jan2021 at 03:00 PM, lot number EK9231, intramuscular, in left arm. Medical history included Crohn&#39;s disease. The patient had no COVID before vaccination. Concomitant medication included azathioprine (IMURAN) at 150 mg, daily.

The events required Emergency room/department or urgent care and treatment with diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) 25 mg IV. COVID was not tested after vaccination. The events were resolving.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association, causality between events tachycardia (HR into 140s), numbness and tingling around lips and warm flushing and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded.

It was the worst the first 2-3 days after the vaccine. It has improved somewhat, but is still not fully resolved and my improvement seems to have pleatued in the past few days. It is not debilitating nor a deterrent for me getting my 2nd dose, but I felt compelled to report my symptoms as I don&#39;t see dizziness and palpitations listed as a possible side effect.

Even laying down had the room spinning. It has not been consistent and has improved as the day has gone but has yet to go away.

I was taken to a separate area and felt warm and flush in my chest. They laid me down on the cot and said I looked pale. My hands were cold and within minutes I was shaking uncontrollably. I think it was an anxiety related to my research I&#39;ve done at my job related to COVID. I don&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction, but I do have an appt on Thursday. I was monitored for about an hour. Symptoms went away but I wasn&#39;t totally ok until the next day besides soreness in next arm.

Reported feeling poorly to nurse monitoring people waiting at 30 minute mark, who encouraged waiting longer but did no further assessment. Waited another 15 minutes with no resolution or improvement. Decided to leave and monitoring staff said they could not keep patients if they wanted to leave.   - Approximately 15 minutes later (1hr after injection), took one 25mg Benadryl liquid gel as nausea/headache/fast heart rate were consistent with prior allergic reaction and not with prior vaccine response. Those symptoms resolved after 1-2 hours; the feeling of mild illness lingered for approx. 3 days more.

A 36-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK5730) dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 11:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included von willebrand&#39;s disease, narcolepsy with cataplexy, IIH (Idiopathic intracranial hypertension), HTN (hypertension), GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), migraines. Patient also had known allergies: PCN (penicillin), shellfish, IV contrast, cefdinir and bees. On 23Dec2020, patient got nerve blocks for her migraines. Throughout the day patient was cough and her face started flushing so she tooled diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). Around 22:30, patient felt like her throat was closing and she was choking. She had chest pain, chest tightness. EMS (emergency medical services) was called and patient was brought to the hospital. On 25Dec2020, patient felt like her throat was closing, like someone was sitting on her chest and chest tightness still with chest pain. Very SOB (shortness of breath) at rest. Patient went to the ER (emergency room) and received IV dexamethasone (DECADRON) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride. On 26Dec2020, patient had the same symptoms but with severe facial flushing and patient went back to the ER and was given IV dexamethasone. Patient was sent home on a maximum amount of medications. I had seen her primary care, ENT (ear nose throat centre), Allergy, ID (infectious disease), and pulmonology. Her CT (computerised tomogram) of chest on 25Dec2020 was negative along with her COVID test. Patient SOB on rest and exertion still. Onset date of the adverse events was reported as 23Dec2020, 22:30. Patient received treatment for the events included multiple medications and high dose prednisone. Lab data on 25Dec2020 included CT of chest: negative, influenza type A/B combo: negative, Covid 19: negative and nasal swab: negative. Action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship.  The clinical presentation of the events is suggestive of possible allergic reactions. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I self administered 8 puffs of albuterol (my prescription) and took 50 mg of oral Benadryl with improvement in wheezing and swelling at injection site. I continue with some mild unilateral right upper eyelid swelling but much improved.

Felt like it spread through my body,  I felt a weird feeling in my chest, throat, my legs felt weak, I was light headed and my heart started to beat hard and fast. It then started to subside over several minutes. The nurse kept me for 30 minutes and then I felt ok to walk out. I had a bit of a headache and didn?t feel right the rest of the night.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

                                                Patient reported, &#34;I received my Covid 19 vaccination on Monday evening. I experienced a reaction immediately following. Within 10 minutes I had tachycardia (130s), high BP (160s), lightheadedness, nausea, headache, and feeling like I was going to faint. I was attended to by Ambulance paramedics. At the time of her report to her primary care provider on 1/7/2021, she was still having pretty significant side effects (headache, dizziness, and light sensitivity), enough so that I was staying home from work. These symptoms have now resolved.

Prior to the syncope, she reported hyperventilating. She remained unresponsive for about 10 minutes and was brought to the ED. There she became responsive, and reported chest pain and had sinus tachycardia episodes. She also had lower extremity weakness. This has improved per the latest neurology notes. She also had a negative EEG. Unsure if this is an allergic reaction or if the syncope was due to hyperventilation.  Patient is currently on day 3 of hospitalization.

After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the booster dose, she awoke feeling extremely ill and nauseous, roused me to say so, and then immediately became unresponsive and pulseless. She was admitted to hospital for cardiac work up, and all diagnostic tests have found her heart to be normal in structure and function. Cardiology believes she experienced a vasovagal syncope with asystole. She remains hospitalized at this time for initiation of sotalol therapy; she was diagnosed with frequent PVCs approximately 1 year ago.

First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

Horrible headache that did improve with tylenol and ibuprofen taken at the same time. Body shakes and can&#39;t control body temperature.  Felt freezing cold but skin was very hot to the touch (according to my husband). Then, I started sweating and felt really hot and couldn&#39;t cool down.  Felt nauseous but no vomiting.    Could not sleep but felt very tired.  Today is now 48 hours after vaccine and body aches are gone but I am still extremely fatigued.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine (approximately 17 hours post-dose), I got up to use the restroom.  While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

Later I got really weak and shaky, fatigued, that night I woke up with night sweats, and chills, woke up completely drenched, I had to change the sheets and pajamas. 5 days after the vaccine I was really exhausted, the fatigue was awful. There was also an itching sensation but no hives.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (COVID 19, brand: Pfizer) lot no: EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 07:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient had no relevant medical history and no known allergies. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination, last menstrual date was on 05Oct2020, delivery date will be on 12Jun2021, gestation period: 11.  Concomitant medication includes daily multivitamin. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 30Dec2020 04:00 am, 7 days after vaccine (as reported), a large mass appeared in right axilla. The mass was painful to touch. Overnight mass more than doubled in size on 31Dec2020 the mass took up her entire arm pit, went to immediate care and was given antibiotics. The mass decreased in size but has not gone away. She followed up with primary care. She had bloodwork and ultrasound of axilla and right breast. Blood work was normal. Ultrasound showed a few enlarged and abnormal lymph nodes believed to be reactive in nature. Largest lymph node as of 08Dec2020 2.5 x 0.9 x 2.2 cm. The events were reported as non-serious. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 14:45 at 36-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  Medical history included Wilms tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, Kidney resection and chemo from 1986 to an unknown date, sulfonamide allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 21Dec2020. On 12Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced vasovagal syncope with asystole (hospitalization, medically significant).  The patient was hospitalized for vasovagal syncope with asystole on unknown dates for 4 days (at the time of the report). It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment due to the events. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient experienced what was believed to be a vasovagal syncope with asystole; approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose. The patient had been admitted to the hospital since all cardiac diagnosis tests were negative for structural or functional abnormalities. The patient remained in-patient at this time for initiation of therapy for frequent PVCs, which were diagnosis about one year ago; but chose not to treat at that time, as the symptoms were not affecting her lifestyle. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac diagnosis tests: negative for structural or functional abnormalities on an unknown date.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination; and was not tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the vasovagal syncope with asystole cannot be excluded. The event is confounded by the patient&#39;s underlying premature ventricular contractions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 11Jan2021 15:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism, asthma, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, chronic allergies, gastritis, and walnut allergy. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), metformin, loratadine (CLARITINE), spironolactone, and calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 2000). The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 21Dec2020 15:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient verbalized, &#34;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related but I figured I should report just in case. I have had severe lymph node swelling on the right side where I got the vaccine. 24hrs post 2nd vaccination I have had a sudden onset of an extremely violent cough. By sudden onset, I mean I had no desire to cough and over about 30 min I developed the severe need to cough. My sputum is greenish/yellow brown with blood flecks. I&#39;ve never experienced such a violent cough with so much sudden sputum production. I am using an Albuterol inhalor to help chest tightness.&#34; Clinical outcome of chest discomfort was unknown while for the other events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a close chronological association, a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded.

                                                Started with some nausea around noon on 1/18 that resolved, then experienced nausea without emesis and palpitations while driving to work at 1800. She describes it as feeling like her heart was racing, but also feeling like she was having large pauses in her heart rate in between the palpitation sensations. She drank a bottle of water and the feeling went away temporarily but it returned.  I am an employee, on arriving to work I noted increased shortness of breath which is unusual for me because I am an avid runner and very active. I noted the palpitations from around 1800-2000, including becoming dizzy and lightheaded during my shift which could endanger patient care, so I presented to the ED and was placed in the CCA. I had received both covid vaccines, second one on 1/11/21 and had about 20H malaise/fatigue and some expiratory wheezing which was abnormal for her but all has since resolved. I had intermittent heart palpitations and chest until 1/26

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid.

They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck. She was hot, flush, and dizzy. She felt like she was going to throw up. That passed. They then gave her Epi in the opposite arm, her right arm. She got the COVID vaccine in her left arm. Then, they got her ready to go to the hospital. The transfer was smooth. She was waiting for intake when she started to not be able to swallow. She complained quickly. The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours.

A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

It was non painful at first, but now it is tender. It is roughly the size of an egg/golf ball. I also have tenderness on my chest  above my right breast but on the pectoralis muscle. Nothing in the right armpit. I also had aggressive itching at the injection site and a hard area and red welt.

A 36-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose on 05Feb2021 12:30 for Covid-19 immunisation, being a caregiver.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received flu vaccine for immunization and had side effects. On 06Feb2021 she woke up feeling unwell a few hours before reporting. Reporter and patient went for a 4 mile walk and she felt sluggish during the walk and her heart was racing, hands were shaking and she felt as if she was going to faint. When they arrived back home the reporter checked her heart rate and it was not that high and her symptoms were subsiding. The reporter would like to know if his wife should go to the ER. A few years before the patient had side effects from the flu vaccine so he was expecting her to have a reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included heart rate: it was not that high on 06Feb2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. The reporter assessed the events as not serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

                                                I initially had itchiness at injection site, then more of my arm. At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 36-years-old; Batch/Lot number and expiry date were not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient fainted on 02Mar2021 and recovered from the event on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I got the Covid Vaccine and Wondering I have been having increasingly shortness of breath for last few days; gotten worse everyday its a little bit worse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. This nurse reported for self that the 37-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot: EJ1685, Expiration Date: Mar2021), via Intramuscular on left deltoid on 20Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included Multivitamins  and escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO). Nurse stated, &#34;I was wondering I got the Pfizer (Covid) Vaccine on 20th and I have been having increasingly shortness of breath for last few days and I am wondering if that&#39;s the typical side effect of that. It wasn&#39;t prescribed, it was something given out to all the healthcare providers. It was like the first dose. It was first dose. I got an Intramuscular shot in left shoulder. Because I wanted to not spread it (Covid). I am not sure if it is due to the product, I got &#34;6&#34; (not clarified) from another patient, that&#39;s why I am calling, I want to know if this is like the typical side effect of vaccination or should I go get tested. I haven&#39;t taken any treatment yet. It&#39;s gotten worse everyday its a little bit worse.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A non-pregnant 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: Unknown), intramuscularly in the left arm on 19Dec2020 at 37-years-old at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included intermittent asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: mild asthma attack on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, moderate dyspnea on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, chest pressure on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, a 4-5 cm area of induration in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, mild erythema in her left deltoid area in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown. The patient had intermittent asthma with no attacks in the past six years. Two days after the vaccination, she had a mild asthma attack when she was walking up stairs. For the past two days, she has had multiple asthma attacks, with moderate dyspnea and chest pressure present for most of the day. The patient&#39;s symptoms have been improving with her as needed (PRN) salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. The physician saw the patient in a telemedicine visit and found her to have an asthma exacerbation; therefore, prednisone was prescribed. The patient had no symptoms of viral infection and reported testing negative for COVID-19 after the onset of her asthma symptoms. The physician suspected her asthma exacerbation to have been caused by the vaccine because she had been symptom-free in recent years and she has not had a new exposure other than the vaccine. In addition to her respiratory symptoms, the patient had a 4-5 cm area of induration and mild erythema in her left deltoid area; this appeared about 1 week after she received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild asthma attack, moderate dyspnea, chest pressure. The patient, since the vaccination, had been tested for COVID-19. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The medical history included she had COVID back on 11Oct2020. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 and 2nd dose is due on Friday. She reported being sore in both arms and short of breath, stats 92% on pulse ox. The day after the vaccine, on 22Dec2020 she had the same symptoms as when she had COVID. Both of her arms were sore. She was short of breath. Her sats (saturation) dropped to 92% on a pulse ox (oximetry). The shortness of breath wigged her out. She stated she experienced shortness of breath and her oxygen saturation dropped for 48 hours. She was healthy before this with no preexisting conditions. She didn&#39;t know if she should get the second vaccine. She read most people are getting a bigger response from the second vaccine. She stated she also had a headache on an unspecified date. She had a headache for 24 hours and she experienced both arms being shaky on an unspecified date. The patient stated her symptoms were similar to when she had COVID and that she did not wait 90 days before getting the first dose of the COVID vaccine since she had COVID. She was scheduled to receive her second dose of COVID vaccine on 08Jan2021. She wanted to know if she was going to end up with a bigger reaction. The patient would like to know if she should receive the second dose since she had a reaction to the first dose. The events were reported as non-serious. The event outcome was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The headache continued and soon some fatigue and tiredness accompanied it for 7-10 days following vaccination.  Then ten days after, I had an increase in symtpoms that included heightened fatigue, loss of appetite, feeling &#34;cold&#34;/ &#34;hot&#34; (no fever), and abdominal pain with nausea and some diarrhea.    Two weeks after vaccination, I had an increased of fatigue and not feeling well, accompained by a fever of (101.5 F) and chills, sore throat, and lethargy.  My symptoms of fever, chills, sore throat, body aches, congestion, and fatigue remained over the next few days and soon included chest pain and some increase work of breath.  With two negative Covid tests through work, it was recommended I go to see a physician, who instead sent me to Immediate Care.  There I had an EKG which showed sinus bradycardia and they sent me to ER due to my symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath.   At the ER, multiple tests were run to negative results.  ER Physician suspects that some of my struggles could be related to Covid vaccine but that I also may have caught an non-Covid virus on top of it which led to acute bronchitis.

Extremely benign -  for 24 and 25th - dull headache and arm at injection site was sore. 27th - all of a sudden I had an elevated resting heartrate - 140 - would go up and down and when it was down it didn&#39;t go to normal -  it went to 90s and my resting heart rate is in 60s.  And also had chest tightness, shortness of breath and fatigue. Went to ER  That all lasted for 10 days. Fatigue aspect got better; the heartrate slowly started getting a little better. Chest tightness and shortness of breath - even when heartrate went down a little, I was still experiencing those symptoms anyway. Off and on thing for 10 days. Last 10 days - have significant improvement. Due for 2nd dose tomorrow - dr has advised I hold off.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

                                                I had a couple of heart palpitations the first 5 mins, the next 2 hours I could feel  my heart beating but wasn&#39;t irregular, I took a shower I realized I had a rash on my arms and thighs (front), did not hurt or itch,  pinprick bumps, it felt like sandpaper. I had facial flushing, felt hot and turned red, I took pepcid and benydryl, I went to sleep because that was the end of my shift . The rash stuck around for 1.5 weeks for the rash to go away . I woke up 6 hours after and  felt fine I only had the rash and I went to occumed to document my symptoms and everything was fine after that

A 37-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot # EJ1685) at single dose at left arm on 02Jan2021 11:45 for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient has received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 03Jan2021 the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with rapid nasal swab test resulted positive. It was unknown if treatment was received. The outcome of events was unknown. Later the patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot # EL0140) at single dose at left arm on 23Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at Pharmacy or drug store. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in 2 weeks of this vaccination included: Lamictal, Klonopin, multivitamins, D, C, B, Zinc. On 24Jan2021 12:00 AM the patient experienced extreme tiredness, chills, fever, muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, pale skin, malaise, night sweats. No treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag. Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use. Further information like confirmative COVID 19 nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment.

                                                This is a 37 y.o. woman who developed an episode of acute self-limited hemolysis just over a week following her second injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5&#39;s and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.  As this occurred just over a week following her second vaccination I cannot exclude that is could be related to the vaccine.

                                                After my second dose of the vaccine I had typical flu-like symptoms (fever 101.5, chills/shivering, body pain, headache, nausea) yet also developed acute and severe shortness of breath. My flu-like symptoms resolved within 48 hours yet my breathing difficulties continued and worsened. I was treated in the Emergency Department on 1/12, 1/19 and 1/20 (work up negative for covid, pulmonary embolism, infection, cardiac abnormalities). It feels as though I am having intractable diaphragm spasms that are forcing my exhales out at the end of my breath cycle. I have lost 10lbs and have been essentially incapacitated for 6 weeks. I have been evaluated by head and neck (no vocal cord dysfunction), speech pathology (no swallowing difficulties), pulmonology (no lung specific issues) and am awaiting a neurology consult.

She was administered some medication by the staff at the site where the COVID-19 vaccine was being administered, but her allergic reaction kept progressing. She developed a rash on her torso first, and then she developed a rash on her neck and face. She then developed shortness of breath. She was brought to the hospital&#39;s Emergency Room for further treatment. She was given the oral medications Pepcid 40mg, Claritin (dose unknown), and Benadryl 25mg at the location where the COVID-19 vaccines were being administered. When she started to experience shortness of breath, she used her own personal Albuterol inhaler. When she was in the Emergency Room, she was given a shot of Epinephrine .4ml at 15:16, and a dose of Benadryl 25mg IV at 15:10. She was observed in the Emergency Room for a couple of hours and then discharged. The patient was also given a steroid dose pack for her itching, clarified as Medrol 4mg tablets. She said she is titrating down the amount of Medrol 4mg tablets (NDC Number: 59762-4440-2, Lot Number: DM4008, Expiration Date: Oct2022).

A 37-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Jan2021, at  08:30 as the second single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included  past history of migraines and colitis from unknown dates.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took erythromycin and experienced allergy; the patient also has a vaccination history of BNT162B2 (lot number: EJ1685) as first dose on 18Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization.  On 08Jan2021, at 20:00, the patient experienced acute and severe shortness of breath, typical flu-like symptoms (elaborated as fever 101.5, chills/shivering, body pain, headache, nausea), and lost 10lbs. The events were reported as life-threatening, elaborated by the reporting nurse as have been &#34;essentially incapacitated for six weeks&#34;.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101.5 on 08Jan2021, Nasal Swab: negative on 12Jan2021, weight: lost 10lbs on an unspecified date. Clinical course was as follows:  patient noted that it felt as though she was having intractable diaphragm spasms that were forcing her exhales out at the end of her breath cycle. She lost 10lbs and was essentially incapacitated for 6 six weeks.  The patient has been evaluated by head and neck , with no noted vocal cord dysfunction, speech pathology (no swallowing difficulties were noted), pulmonology (no lung specific issues were noted) and was awaiting a neurology consult. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, and included unspecified treatments in the emergency department described as lots of medications.  There was no COVID infection prior to vaccination, and the patient has been tested post the vaccination, with negative results as aforementioned.  The clinical outcome of typical flu-like symptoms (fever 101.5, chills/shivering, body pain, headache, nausea) was recovered in Jan2021; the clinical outcome of acute and severe shortness of breath and lost 10lbs was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on event-vaccine chronological association, a causal relationship between events severe shortness of breath and typical flu-like symptoms and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. the event lost weight is attributed to an intercurrent medical condition and assessed unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I felt fine after the shot all day. I went to bed at 1030pm, woke up at 1130 hyperventilating (respiratory rate was 40&#43; and I couldn?t lower it),  shaking uncontrollably (felt increasingly cold, though my temp was normal; my skin was cold to the touch but I felt like it was burning off), tachycardic (heart rate was 140bpm and I normally am at 60-80 at rest). My throat felt like it was closing and my face was swollen. I should have gone to the ER, but I wasn?t thinking clearly and didn?t know what to do with my small children.  It took 2 hours until I stopped shaking, my heart rate returned to normal, and my breathing was under control.  Since then I have mainly been fatigued, taking Tylenol for overall aches, and have not been able to tolerate much activity (can only stand for about 5 minutes at a time).

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

Reported to ER for management of symptoms. Received fluids, ibuprofen, Zofran and Reglan as well as potassium. It is currently the following Monday so 5 days post vaccine and I continue to have intermittent nausea and headache.

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

I was diagnosed with pleurisy by my MD ~6 weeks after the original illness, and it slowly resolved over time. This current chest pain is similar. It is not limiting my activity, but is a little annoying.

Took motrin throughout the day and 50 mg of benadryl at bedtime. 1/13: Left arm pit still swollen. more tender with movement. While at work i put hot compress in my arm pit to help with the pain and shortly after i noticed my left arm had bright red streaks from my arm pit to my wrist. It also was very mottled looking. My arm felt tight/heavy  or kind of like a pinched nerve feeling.. I took motrin throughout the day for soreness and took benadryl at bedtime. I place ice pack under my arm during the evening as well.  1/14: Swelling remains in the armpit. Tenderness is getting better. Similar swelling around clavicle . Still taking motrin for inflammation and using ice pack under my arm.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart began to race and I became very warm and sweaty. I was brought into another room for monitoring and my heart rate was above 100. After some breathing exercises, it came back down to the high 70s for a few minutes but then increased again into the 90s, at one point it was 113. My chest and throat then began to feel tight and I began sweating again. My face also felt funny on my right cheek. At that point I was first given 25 mg of benedryl then epinephrine. I was then taken to the emergency room via ambulance and was observed for approximately an hour. I was given an additional 25 mg of benedryl and discharged at 4:55pm. I was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and prescribed 25 mg of benedryl every 6 hours over the next 24 hours. The following morning, I experienced a hot flash with profuse sweating followed by chills. I was very tired and felt feverish throughout the day on 1/12 and stayed home from work. On 1/13 I still felt tired but was able to work. Today I feel mostly normal but still occasionally have had heart palpitations.

A 38-year-old female patient received the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at 38-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood clotting disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: my heart rate, I was like in AFib (medically significant) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, very high fever of 103 (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, dizzy, light headed (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, arms sore (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, exhausted like an extreme fatigue (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered, palpitations (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered.  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;the day after the shot I got a very high fever of 103. I was dizzy, lightheaded. My heart rate I was like in AFib, it was going from 60s to 50s all over the place. And this was the next day after the vaccination. That evening nothing my arms was just sore. But the next day all of these side effects just started in and even still today I just feel so exhausted like an extreme fatigue and I am still getting like palpitations.&#34; The patient stated, &#34;So I went to urgent care and they check my vitals and stuff and when they wanted me to send me to the hospital. But I told them I will get a ride and I go by myself just because I didn&#39;t want, capable of an ambulance ride and I ended up just going home because I couldn&#39;t get a hold up anybody. So, I came home and took my blood thinner medication because I do have blood clotting disorder.&#34;  In regard to the outcomes of the events, the patient stated, &#34;I am not experiencing all of them still definitely my heart is much better. I am still getting palpitations but nothing near how it was that first day. I am experiencing extreme fatigue.&#34;

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

I took a dose of oral Benadryl it didn&#39;t go away. It felt like a sunburn.  I had a headache starting at the back of my head. 1st and second day, I had pain in my joints. Not muscular pain. It came and went the joint pain - behind my left knee was hurting really bad and then it went away. Then my right wrist would start hurting and then it would go away, etc. The second day, the headache was more mild - like a mild pressure in my head. The redness was still there - the red face and red arms. My left arm at the site was cherry red and about the size of two inch circle and somewhat raised. The third day, my headache was worse. It was not like a normal headache but an overall pressure in head. Pink and a bit larger but didn&#39;t  hurt as  bad on arm- the redness continued for six days on my face. The headache lasted 14 days straight - Motrin, ice, heat and extra sleep was tried for treatment. On 15th day it started to let up. On 16th day, it was very mild headache. On the 17th day, it was a full blown headache again. Day 18 it was gone. On the second week, I had mild pain in my stomach and then that went away. On day 3, I had about an hour - twice that day - where I was short of breath and then it went away - it was just that day - about noon and at night. I took Benadryl and when I woke up that didn&#39;t  happen again. Doctor called on day 12 - when my headaches weren&#39;t going away. He took some labs. My labs were normal except thyroid (and I already have a condition for my thyroid). Dr. gave me a medication for headache but I didn&#39;t take it - it had a possibility of making me tired and I didn&#39;t want to take it.

I sat down and had a few sips of water.  Within a few minutes, I felt like I was having a difficult time getting a good breath in.   I raised my hands over my head and took slow deep breaths to try and keep my breathing  under control.  I stayed at the hospital for about 45 minutes, over which time I had a few bites to eat and some water.   The flushing and sweating resolved within that time.  The lightheadedness and &#34;feeling of doom&#34; lasted about 3 hours.  I had no anxiety going into this vaccine, nor have I had a reaction like this before.

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 24Dec2020 at 08:00 AM in the hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, has no known allergies, had no other medications in two weeks, and did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. At 3:00 PM of 24Dec2020, the patient developed a severe tachycardia with no other symptoms. She walked herself to the ER (Emergency room/department or urgent care), was nervous and kind of shaking. By the time they got to her, her heart rate was stable and was at 88. Transient tachycardia was at around 120-140 for 7 minutes and resolved with no intervention. Basic labs came back normal. She got discharged from the ER. The patient didn&#39;t think they reported it but she was willing to cooperate in any way. The patient was not treated for the adverse events. As per the patient, she reported her adverse reaction (after the 1st dose) on the website as recommended. She experienced &#34;very fast heart beat 8 hours after receiving the vaccine&#34;. The patient was inquiring if she would be contacted after. The patient also asked if the very fast heartbeat was related to the vaccine because the reaction did not happen right away like usual, she was not sure if it was an allergic reaction since it happened 8 hours later. Outcome of the event &#39;Tachycardia&#39; was recovered in Dec2020, while for the other events was unknown. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

                                                10 MINUTES after the injection, I became very hot and flushed, with headache, palpitations, weakness, and shortness of breath. I sat down, my heart rate was 110 on my I watch. I was breathing heavy and feeling sweaty. The healthcare providers had me lie down on a stretcher and gave me oxygen with my feet elevated. After about 20 minutes, I felt better. Later that day, I came home and slept for 2 hours. The next day, (today) I came home early from work because I feel very tired and having difficulty concentrating. But the other symptoms have gone away.

                                                15 minutes post injection, I was tachycardic, lightheaded, nearly fell over (nurse caught me as I started to sway), and my throat felt thick like something was stuck in it. Staff sat me into a recliner and called an ICU attending. Benedryl IM was given.  Throat symptoms did not get worse but did take about 10-12 hours to resolve.

                                                I had a slight headache while at work but was fine. I was home and was a little cold and my throat was scratchy. . Then about 9pm all of a sudden I started to get waves of chills. My hand were cold and my feet were frozen. I layered up with sweater and sweatpants to go to bed with a heavy comforter. I just could not get warm. About 1am, I woke up and put on my thick winter socks on because my feet were still frozen. I kept reminding myself to breathe in deeply.  I checked my BPM and it was 80-82 and normally its about low  70s. I woke up about 5:30am and had a really bad headache, injection area and arm hurt, my  body hurt and felt like I weighed several tons making me so slow. I didn&#39;t go to work the next day. My husband took my son to school and I took ibuprofen and went back to bed. Woke up again about 12:30 and felt better.

It seemed unusual but nothing I couldn&#39;t handle or out of control.  I just wish they had informed me so I would have taken extra care when handling the knife.  I&#39;m not sure if this was related to the vaccine but I had never bleed that long before so I wanted to report it as a potential side effect.  I still think benefits of vaccine outweigh risk involved with vaccine so I am glad to have had the shot.

I didn&#39;t have any other symptoms during my 15 min observation period, but when I got to my car to leave the hospital, I had another episode of dizziness that lasted a couple minutes and then stopped. I didn&#39;t have any other incidents of dizziness, but started feeling fatigued and had chills that afternoon. Tuesday evening I had a slight fever, diarrhea, tachycardia, and palpitations. Over night I developed body aches.  Most of the symptoms were pretty much gone within 24 hrs, but the fatigue and tachycardia lasted into Friday. My heart rate was consistently 115-125 bpm from Tuesday evening through Friday.

This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

I feel my heart beats stronger than normal. my heart palpitation didn&#39;t improve overnight. 01/10/21 I feel shortness of breath with talking and walking. My chest hurts. My head hurst. I call my hospital and talked to an RN urgent line. She suggested me to go to Urgent Care or ER. I went to Urgent Care at 1500 that day. At check in my blood pressure was 160/110 (my normal BP is around 120/90 or less) heart rate was 112. EKG was done, result no concern. Urgent Care Doctor sent me home with no medication. He said what I experienced is the reaction of my body with the Covid vaccine. He told me to go to ER if my symptoms get worse. I went and see my primary doctor ( bloods tests was done ) and Cardiologist after with EKG and ECHO done. I was off from work during that time. I feel back to normal after 10 days.

This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy.

Then on 2/14/2021 I started feeling burning  pain all over my neck and chest. It was slightly red that night. The next morning my chest, neck, and upper back had a red rash . My chest was the worst of it. Felt like a chemical burn . I went to the Doctor on 2/17/2021 and was told it was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine. I continued to take Benadryl, Zyrtec  and was given Kenalog. On Sunday 2/21/2021 the pain was so pain and the rash was only getting worse and now on my face so I went to urgent care. There I was given a steroid ( prednisone) , derma smoothe and Pepcid. It has been 10 days and no improvement yet.

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

A non-pregnant 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 at 39-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks of the suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart murmur, Latex allergy; both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported; and no other medications were received within two weeks of the suspect vaccine. On 19Jan2021, the patient experienced: felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side (non-serious), streaks of heat along the back of her scalp (non-serious), heat in her chest (non-serious), right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder (non-serious), hot flashes (non-serious). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient, ten minutes after the vaccination, felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side. This was followed by streaks of heat along the back of her scalp, and heat in her chest. After about an hour, the right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder. The patient&#39;s &#34;body stayed that way for about 20 hours.&#34; The patient also experienced hot flashes, which was not something that she ever had before. The patient feared getting the second dose because her body felt so off after the first dose. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination with the suspect vaccine.   The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number and Expiration date was unknown), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date, second dose via intramuscularly in right arm on 16Jan2021 15:30; both at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included depression, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), latex allergy. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine, L-methylfolate; the patient received both the drugs within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took fluoxetine, citalopram and experienced known allergies for both the drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension on 25Jan2021 06:00. On 01Feb2021, the patient underwent lab test and procedure included nasal swab/ COVID-19 by PCR: Negative. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with IV Dexamethazone, Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, promethazine for all the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: On the basis of the available information, the reported events debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension would seem most likely related to intercurrent and/or underlying medical condition and concomitant medication, which is not related to bnt162b2.
